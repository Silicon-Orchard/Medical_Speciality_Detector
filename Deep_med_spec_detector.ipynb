       "['DIAGNOSIS:,  Stasis ulcers of the lower extremities,OPERATION:,  Split-thickness skin grafting a total area of approximately 15 x 18 cm on the right leg and 15 x 15 cm on the left leg.,INDICATIONS:,  This 84-year old female presented recently with large ulcers of the lower extremities.  These were representing on the order of 50% or more of the circumference of her lower leg.  They were in a distribution to be consistent with stasis ulcers.  They were granulating nicely and she was scheduled for surgery.,FINDINGS:,  Large ulcers of lower extremities with size as described above.  These are irregular in shape and posterior and laterally on the lower legs.  There was no evidence of infection.  The ultimate skin grafting was quite satisfactory.,PROCEDURE: , Having obtained adequate general endotracheal anesthesia, the patient was prepped from the pubis to the toes.  The legs were examined and the wounds were Pulsavaced bilaterally with 3 liters of saline with Bacitracin.  The wounds were then inspected and there was adequate hemostasis and there was only minimal fibrinous debris that needed to be removed.  Once this was accomplished, the skin was harvested from the right thigh at approximately 0.013 inch.  This was meshed 1:1.5 and then stapled into position on the wounds.  The wounds were then dressed with a fine mesh gauze that was stapled into position as well as Kerlix soaked in Sulfamylon solution.,She was then dressed in additional Kerlix, followed by Webril, and splints were fashioned in a spiral fashion that avoided foot drop and stabilized them, and at the same time did not put pressure across the heels.  The donor site was dressed with Op-Site.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and returned to the recovery room in satisfactory condition.',\n",
       " 'HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:,  Patient is a 50-year-old white male complaining of continued lower back pain.  Patient has a history of chronic back pain, dating back to an accident that he states he suffered two years ago.  He states he helped a friend unload a motorcycle from a vehicle two-and-a-half days ago, after which he \"felt it\" in his lower back.  The following day (two days ago), he states he rode to Massachusetts and Maine to pick up clients.  He feels that this aggravated his chronic back pain as well.  He also claims to have a screw in his right hip from a previous surgery to repair a pelvic fracture.  He is being prescribed Ultram, Celebrex, gabapentin, and amitriptyline by his PCP for his chronic back pain.  He states that his PCP has informed him that he does not prescribe opiate medications for chronic back pain.,The patient did self-refer to another physician, who suggested that he follow up at a pain clinic for his chronic back pain to discuss other alternatives, particularly the medications that the patient feels that he needs.  Patient states he did not do this because he was feeling well at that time.,The patient did present to our emergency room last night, at which time he saw Dr. X.  He was given a prescription for 12 Vicodin as well as some to take home last night.  The patient has not picked up his prescription as of yet and informed the triage nurse that he was concerned that he would not have enough to last through the weekend.  Patient states he also has methadone and Darvocet at home from previous prescription and is wondering if he should restart these medicines.  He is on several medications, the list of which is attached to the chart.,MEDICATIONS: , In addition to the aforementioned medications, he is on Cymbalta, pantoprazole, and a multivitamin.,ALLERGIES:,  HE IS ALLERGIC TO RELAFEN (ITCHING).,SOCIAL HISTORY: , The patient is married and lives with his wife.,Nursing notes were reviewed with which I agree.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION,VITAL SIGNS:  Pulse is elevated at 105.  Temp and other vitals signs are all within normal limits.,GENERAL:  Patient is a middle-aged white male who is sitting on the stretcher in no acute distress.,BACK:  Exam of the back shows some generalized tenderness on palpation of the musculature surrounding the lumbar spine, more so on the right than on the left.  There is a well-healed upper lumbar incision from his previous L1-L2 fusion.  There is no erythema, ecchymosis, or soft-tissue swelling.  Mobility is generally very good without obvious signs of discomfort.,HEART:  Regular rate and rhythm without murmurs, rubs, or gallops.,LUNGS:  Clear without rales, rhonchi, or wheezes.,MUSCULOSKELETAL:  With the patient supine, there is some discomfort in the lower back with bent-knee flexion of both hips as well as with straight leg abduction of the left leg.  There is some mild discomfort on internal and external rotation of the hips as well.  DTRs are 1+ at the knees and trace at the ankles.,I explained to the patient that he is suffering from a chronic condition and as his PCP has made it clear that he is unwilling to prescribe opiate medication, which the patient feels that he needs, and he is obligated to follow up at the pain clinic as suggested by the other physician even if he is having a \"good day.\"  I explained to him that if he did not investigate other alternatives to what his PCP is willing to prescribe, then on a \"bad day,\" he will have nowhere else to turn.  I explained to him that some emergency physicians do chose to use opiates for a short term as Dr. X did last night.  It is unclear if the patient is looking for a different opiate medication, but I do not think it is wise to give him more, particularly as he has not even filled the prescription that was given to him last night.  I did suggest that he not restart his methadone and Darvocet at this time as he is already on five different medications for his back (Celebrex, tramadol, amitriptyline, gabapentin, and the Vicodin that he was given last night).  I did suggest that we could try a different anti-inflammatory if he felt that the Celebrex is not helping.  The patient is agreeable to this.,ASSESSMENT,1.  Lumbar muscle strain.,2.  Chronic back pain.,PLAN: , At this point in time, I felt that it was safe for the patient to transition to heat to his back which he may use as often as possible.  Rx for Voltaren 75 mg tabs, dispensed 20, sig. one p.o. q.12h. for pain instead of Celebrex.  He may continue with his other medications as directed but not the methadone or Darvocet.  I did urge him to reschedule his pain clinic appointment as he was urged to do originally.  If unimproved this week, he should follow up with Dr. Y.',\n",
       " 'CC:, Stable expressive aphasia and decreased vision.,HX:, This 72y/o woman was diagnosed with a left sphenoid wing meningioma on 6/3/80. She was 59 years old at the time and presented with a 6 month history of increasing irritability and left occipital-nuchal headaches. One month prior to that presentation she developed leftward head turning, and 3 days prior to presentation had an episode of severe dysphasia. A HCT (done locally) revealed a homogenously enhancing lesion of the left sphenoid wing. Skull X-rays showed deviation of the pineal to the right. She was transferred to UIHC and was noted to have a normal neurologic exam (per Neurosurgery note). Angiography demonstrated a highly vascular left temporal/sphenoid wing tumor. She under went left temporal craniotomy and \"complete resection\" of the tumor which on pathologic analysis was consistent with a meningioma.,The left sphenoid wing meningioma recurred and was excised 9/25/84. There was regrowth of this tumor seen on HCT, 1985. A 6/88 HCT revealed the left sphenoid meningioma and a new left tentorial meningioma. HCT in 1989 revealed left temporal/sphenoid, left tentorial, and new left frontal lesions. On 2/14/91 she presented with increasing lethargy and difficulty concentrating. A 2/14/91, HCT revealed increased size and surrounding edema of the left frontal meningioma. The left frontal and temporal meningiomas were excised on 2/25/91. These tumors all recurred and a left parietal lesion developed. She underwent resection of the left frontal meningioma on 11/21/91 due to right sided weakness and expressive aphasia. The weakness partially resolved and though the speech improved following resection it did not return to normal. In May 1992 she experienced 3 tonic-clonic type seizures, all of which began with a Jacksonian march up the RLE then RUE before generalizing. Her Phenobarbital prophylaxis which she had been taking since her 1980 surgery was increased. On 12/7/92, she underwent a left fronto-temporo-parieto-occipital craniotomy and excision of five meningiomas. Postoperatively she developed worsened right sided weakness and expressive aphasia. The weakness and aphasia improved by 3/93, but never returned to normal.',\n",

The extremity was then prepped and draped in the standard surgical fashion.  A medial suprapatellar portal was marked on the skin as well as anteromedial and anterolateral joint line.  The extremity was wrapped in Esmarch prior to inflation of tourniquet to 250 mmHg.  Esmarch was then removed.  Incisions were then made.  Camera was initially inserted into the lateral joint line.  Visualization of patellofemoral joint revealed type 2 chondromalacia with slight lateral subluxation.  The patient did have congruent articulation about 30 degrees of knee flexion.  Visualization of the medial joint line revealed no loose bodies.  There was a small plica.  Visualization of the medial joint line revealed no significant chondromalacia.  Menisci was probed and tested with no signs of tears and instability.  ACL was noted to be intact.  The intercondylar notch and lateral joint line also revealed no significant chondromalacia or meniscal pathology.  Lateral gutter also demonstrated no loose bodies or plica.  The camera was then removed and inserted into the anteromedial portal using two 18-gauge needles.  The extent of lateral capsular release was marked using a monopolar coblator, lateral capsular release was performed.  The patient had significant improvement in anteromedial translation from 25% to 50%.  At the end of the case, all instruments were removed.  The knee was injected with 32 mL of 0.5% Marcaine with additional epinephrine.  Please note, the patient received 30 mL of 1:500,000 dilution epinephrine at the beginning of the case.  The portals were then closed using 4-0 Monocryl.  The wound was clean and dry, and dressed with Steri-Strips, Xeroform, and 4 x 4s.  The kneecap was translated medially under pressure and a bias placed.  The tourniquet was released at 47 minutes.  The patient was then placed in the knee immobilizer.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and was subsequently extubated and taken to the recovery in stable condition.,POSTOPERATIVE PLAN: , The patient will weightbear as tolerated in the knee immobilizer.  She will start physical therapy within 1 to 2 weeks to work on patella mobilization as well as reconditioning and strengthening.  Intraoperative findings were relayed to the mother.  All questions were answered.',\n",
       " 'IDENTIFYING DATA:,  The patient is a 45-year-old white male.  He is unemployed, presumably on disability and lives with his partner.,CHIEF COMPLAINT: , \"I\\'m in jail because I was wrongly arrested.\" The patient is admitted on a 72-hour Involuntary Treatment Act for grave disability.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , The patient has minimal insight into the circumstances that resulted in this admission.  He reports being diagnosed with AIDS and schizophrenia for some time, but states he believes that he has maintained his stable baseline for many months of treatment for either condition.  Prior to admission, the patient was brought to Emergency Room after he attempted to shoplift from a local department store, during which he apparently slapped his partner.  The patient was disorganized with police and emergency room staff, and he was ultimately detained on a 72-hour Involuntary Treatment Act for grave disability.,On the interview, the patient is still disorganized and confused.  He believes that he has been arrested and is in jail.  Reports a history of mental health treatment, but denies benefiting from this in the past and does not think that it is currently necessary.,I was able to contact his partner by telephone.  His partner reports the patient is paranoid and has bizarre behavior at baseline over the time that he has known him for the last 16 years, with occasional episodes of symptomatic worsening, from which he spontaneously recovers.  His partner estimates the patient spends about 20% of the year in episodes of worse symptoms.  His partner states that in the last one to two months, the patient has become worse than he has ever seen him with increased paranoia above the baseline and he states the patient has been barricading himself in his house and unplugging all electrical appliances for unclear reasons.  He also reports the patient has been sleeping less and estimates his average duration to be three to four hours a night.  He also reports the patient has been spending money impulsively in the last month and has actually incurred overdraft charges on his checking account on three different occasions recently.  He also reports that the patient has been making threats of harm to him and that His partner no longer feels that he is safe having him at home.  He reports that the patient has been eating regularly with no recent weight loss.  He states that the patient is observed responding to internal stimuli, occasionally at baseline, but this has gotten worse in the last few months.  His partner was unaware of any obvious medical changes in the last one to two months coinciding with onset of recent symptomatic worsening.  He reports of the patient\\'s longstanding poor compliance with treatment of his mental health or age-related conditions and attributes this to the patient\\'s dislike of taking medicine.  He also reports that the patient has expressed the belief in the past that he does not suffer from either condition.,PAST PSYCHIATRIC HISTORY: , The patient\\'s partner reports that the patient was diagnosed with schizophrenia in his 20s and he has been hospitalized on two occasions in the 1980s and that there was a third admission to a psychiatric facility, but the date of this admission is currently unknown.  The patient was last enrolled in an outpatient mental health treatment in mid 2009.  He dropped out of care about six months ago when he moved with his partner.  His partner reports the patient was most recently prescribed Seroquel, which, though the patient denied benefiting from, his partner felt was \"useful, but not dosed high enough.\" Past medication trials that the patient reports include Haldol and lithium, neither of which he found to be particularly helpful.,MEDICAL HISTORY: , The patient reports being diagnosed with HIV and AIDS in 1994 and believes this was secondary to unprotected sexual contact in the years prior to his diagnosis.  He is currently followed at Clinic, where he has both an assigned physician and a case manager, but treatment compliance has been poor with no use of antiretroviral meds in the last year.  The patient is fairly vague on his history of AIDS related conditions, but does identify the following:  Thrush, skin lesions, and lung infections; additional details of these problems are not currently known.,CURRENT MEDICATIONS: , None.,ALLERGIES:,  No known drug allergies.,SOCIAL AND DEVELOPMENTAL HISTORY: , The patient lives with his partner.  He is unemployed.  Details of his educational and occupational history are not currently known.  His source of finances is also unknown, though social security disability is presumed.,SUBSTANCE AND ALCOHOL HISTORY: , The patient smoked one to two packs per day for most of the last year, but has increased this to two to three packs per day in the last month.  His partner reports that the patient consumed alcohol occasionally, but denies any excessive or binge use recently.  The patient reports smoking marijuana a few times in his life, but not recently.  Denies other illicit substance use.,LEGAL HISTORY:  ,Unknown.,GENETIC PSYCHIATRIC HISTORY:,  Also unknown.,MENTAL STATUS EXAM:,Attitude:  The patient demonstrates only variable cooperation with interview, requires frequent redirection to respond to questions.  His appearance is cachectic.  The patient is poorly groomed.,Psychomotor:  There is no psychomotor agitation or retardation.  No other observed extrapyramidal symptoms or tardive dyskinesia.,Affect:  His affect is fairly detached.,Mood:  Describes his mood is \"okay.\",Speech:  His speech is normal rate and volume.  Tone, his volume was decreased initially, but this improved during the course of the interview.,Thought Process:  His thought processes are markedly tangential.,Thought content:  The patient is fairly scattered.  He will provide history with frequent redirection, but he does not appear to stay on one topic for any length of time.  He denies currently auditory or visual hallucinations, though his partner says that this is a feature present at baseline.  Paranoid delusions are elicited.,Homicidal/Suicidal Ideation:  He denies suicidal or homicidal ideation.  Denies previous suicide attempts.,Cognitive Assessment:  Cognitively, he is alert and oriented to person and year only.  His memory is intact to names of his Madison Clinic providers.,Insight/Judgment:  His insight is absent as evidenced by his repeated questioning of the validity of his AIDS and mental health diagnoses.  His judgment is poor as evidenced by his longstanding pattern of minimal engagement in treatment of his mental health and physical health conditions.,Assets:  His assets include his housing and his history of supportive relationship with his partner over many years.,Limitations:  His limitations include his AIDS and his history of poor compliance with treatment.,FORMULATION:  ,The patient is a 45-year-old white male with a history of schizophrenia and AIDS.  He was admitted for disorganized and assaultive behaviors while off all medications for the last six months.  It is unclear to me how much his presentation is a direct expression of an AIDS-related condition, though I suspect the impact of his HIV status is likely to be substantial.,DIAGNOSES:,AXIS I:  Schizophrenia by history.  Rule out AIDS-induced psychosis.  Rule out AIDS-related cognitive disorder.,AXIS II:  Deferred.,AXIS III:  AIDS (stable by his report).  Anemia.,AXIS IV:  Relationship strain and the possibility that he may be unable to return to his home upon discharge; minimal engagement in mental health and HIV-related providers.,AXIS V:  Global Assessment Functioning is currently 15.,PLAN: , I will attempt to increase the database, will specifically request records from the last mental health providers.  The Internal Medicine Service will evaluate and treat any acute medical issues that could be helpful to collaborate with his providers at Clinic regarding issues related to his AIDS diagnosis.  With the patient\\'s permission, I will start quetiapine at a dose of 100 mg at bedtime, given the patient\\'s partner report of partial, but response to this agent in the past.  I anticipate titrating further for effect during the course of his admission.',\n",

She was actually able to spontaneously trigger the thumb.  She was diagnosed with stenosing tendinosis and wishes to proceed with release of A1 pulley.  All risks and benefits of the surgery was discussed with her at length.  She was in agreement with the above treatment plan.,PROCEDURE:  ,On 08/21/03, she was taken to operating room at ABCD General Hospital and placed supine on the operating table.  A regional anesthetic was applied by the Anesthesia Department.  Tourniquet was placed on her proximal arm.  The upper extremity was sterilely prepped and draped in the usual fashion.,An incision was made over the proximal crease of the thumb.  Subcuticular tissues were carefully dissected.  Hemostasis was controlled with electrocautery.  The nerves were identified and retracted throughout the entire procedure.  The fibers of the A1 pulley were identified.  They were sharply dissected to release the tendon.  The tendon was then pulled up into the wound and inspected.  There was no evidence of gross tear noted.  Fibrous nodule was noted within the tendon itself.  There was no evidence of continuous locking.  Once release of the pulley had been performed, the wound was copiously irrigated.  It was then reapproximated using #5-0 nylon simple interrupted and horizontal mattress sutures.  Sterile dressing was applied to the upper extremity.  Tourniquet was deflated.  It was noted that the thumb was warm and pink with good capillary refill.  The patient was transferred to Recovery in apparent stable and satisfactory condition.  Prognosis is fair.',\n",

MRI shows disc pathology as well as facet arthrosis.,SUMMARY OF PROCEDURE: , The patient was admitted to the operating room, consent was obtained and signed.  The patient was taken to the Operating room and was placed in the prone position.  Monitors were placed, including EKG, pulse oximeter and blood pressure monitoring.  After adequate IV sedation with Versed and Fentanyl the procedure was begun.,The lumbar sacral region was prepped and draped in sterile fashion with Betadine and four sterile towels.  After the towels were places then sterile drapes were placed on top of that.,After which time the Epimed catheter was then placed, this was done by first repositioning the C-Arm to visualize the lumbar spine and the vertebral bodies were then counted beginning at L5, verifying the sacral hiatus.  The skin over the sacral hiatus was then injected with 1% Lidocaine and an #18-gauge needle was used for skin puncture.  The #18-gauge needle was inserted off of midline.  A #16-gauge RK needle was then placed into the skin puncture and using the paramedian approach and loss-of-resistance technique the needle was placed.  Negative aspiration was carefully performed.  Omnipaque 240 dye was then injected through the #16-gauge RK needle.  The classical run off was noted.  A filling defect was noted @ L45 nerve root on the left side.  After which time 10 cc of 0.25% Marcaine/Triamcinolone (9/1 mixture) was then infused through the 16 R-K Needle.  Some additional lyses of adhesions were visualized as the local anesthetic displaced the Omnipaque 240 dye using this barbotage technique.,An Epimed Tun-L catheter was then inserted through the #16-gauage R-K needle and threaded up to the L45 interspace under continuous fluoroscopic guidance.  As the catheter was threaded up under continuous fluoroscopic visualization lyses of adhesions were visualized.  The tip of the catheter was noted to be @ L45 level on the left side.  After this the #16-gauge RK needle was then removed under fluoroscopic guidance verifying that the tip of the catheter did not migrate from the L45 nerve root region on the left side.  After this was successfully done, the catheter was then secured in place; this was done with Neosporin ointment, a Split 2x2, Op site and Hypofix tape.  The catheter was then checked with negative aspiration and the Omnipaque 240 dye was then injected.  The classical run off was noted in the lumbar region.  Some lyses of adhesions were also visualized at this time with barbotage technique.  Good dye spread was noted to extend one level above and one level below the L45 nerve root and bilateral spread was noted.  Nerve root decompression was visualized as dye spread into the nerve root whereas prior this was a filling defect.  After which time negative aspiration was again performed through the Epimed® Tun-L catheter and then 10 cc of solution was then infused through the catheter, this was done over a 10-minute period with initial 3 cc test dose.  Approximately 3 minutes elapsed and then the remaining 7 cc were infused (Solution consisting of 8 cc of 0.25% Marcaine, 2 cc of Triamcinolone and 1 cc of Wydase.)  The catheter was then capped with a bacterial filter.  The patient was noted to have tolerated the procedure well without any complications.,Interpretation of radiograph revealed nerve root adhesions present with lysis of these adhesions as the procedure was performed.  A filling defect was seen at the L45 nerve root and this filling defect being significant of fibrosis and adhesions in this region was noted to be lysed with the insertion of the catheter as well as the barbotage procedure.  This verified positive nerve root decompression.  The tip of the Epimed Tun L catheter was noted to be at L45 level on the left side.  Positive myelogram without dural puncture was noted during this procedure; no sub-dural spread of Omnipaque 240 dye was noted.

There is no evidence of paraspinal muscle spasm.  On forward bending, there is a mild kyphosis.  She is not able to touch her toes indicating her hamstring tightness.  She has a full 5 out of 5 in all muscle groups.  Her lower extremities including iliopsoas, quadriceps, gastroc-soleus, tibialis anterior, and extensor hallucis longus.  Her sensation intact to light touch in L1 through L2 dermatomal distributions.  She has symmetric limb lengths as well bilaterally from both the coronal and sagittal planes.,X-rays today included PA and lateral sclerosis series.  She has approximately 46 degree kyphosis.,ASSESSMENT: , Kyphosis.,PLANS:  ,The patient's kyphosis is quite mild.  While this is likely in the upper limits of normal or just it is normal for an adolescent and still within normal range as would be expected return at home.  At this time, three options were discussed with the parents including observation, physical therapy, and bracing.  At this juncture, given that she has continued to grow, they are Risser 0.  She may benefit from continued observation with physical therapy, bracing would be a more aggressive option certainly that thing would be lost with following at this time.  As such, she was given a prescription for physical therapy for extension based strengthening exercises, flexibility range of motion exercises, postural training with no forward bending.  We will see her back in 3 months' time for repeat radiographs at that time including PA and lateral standing of scoliosis series.  Should she show evidence of continued progression of her kyphotic deformity, discussions of bracing would be held at time.  We will see her back in 3 months' time for repeat evaluation.\",\n",

Once he was anesthetized, he was then placed in a supine position, and sterilely prepped and draped.  A superior curvilinear scrotal incision was then made in the left hemiscrotum with a 15-blade knife and further extended with electrocautery into the subcutaneous tissue.  We then used the curved cryoclamp to dissect into the scrotal space and found the tunica vaginalis and dissected this up to the external ring.  We were able to dissect all the way up to the ring, but were unable to get the testis delivered.  We then made a left inguinal incision with a 15-blade knife, further extending with electrocautery through Scarpa fascia down to the external oblique fascia.  The testis again was not visualized in the external ring, so we brought the sac up from the scrotum into the inguinal incision and then incised the external oblique fascia with a 15-blade knife further extending with Metzenbaum scissors.  The testis itself was quite high up in the upper canal.  We then dissected the gubernacular structures off of the testis, and also, then opened the sac, and dissected the sac off and found that he had a communicating hernia hydrocele and dissected the sac off with curved and straight mosquitos and a straight Joseph scissors.  Once this was dissected off and up towards the internal ring, it was twisted upon itself and suture ligated with an 0 Vicryl suture.  We then dissected the lateral spermatic fascia, and then, using blunt dissection, dissected in the retroperitoneal space to get more cord length.  We also dissected the sac from the peritoneal reflection up into the abdomen once it had been tied off.  We then found that we had an adequate amount of cord length to get the testis in the mid-to-low scrotum.  The patient was found to have a type III epididymal attachment with a long looping vas, and we brought the testis into the scrotum in the proper orientation and tacked it to mid-to-low scrotum with a 4-0 chromic stay stitch.  The upper aspect of the subdartos pouch was closed with a 4-0 chromic pursestring suture.  The testis was then placed into the scrotum in the proper orientation.  We then placed the local anesthetic, and the ilioinguinal nerve block, and placed a small amount in both incisional areas as well.  We then closed the external oblique fascia with a running suture of 0-Vicryl ensuring that the ilioinguinal nerve and cord structures were not bottom closure.  The Scarpa fascia was closed with a 4-0 chromic suture, and the skin was closed with a 4-0 Rapide subcuticular closure.  Dermabond tissue adhesive was placed on the both incisions, and IV Toradol was given at the end of the procedure.

       " 'PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Coronary artery disease.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Coronary artery disease plus intimal calcification in the mid abdominal aorta without significant stenosis.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:,LEFT HEART CATHETERIZATION WITH ANGIOGRAPHY AND MID ABDOMINAL AORTOGRAPHY:,Under local anesthesia with 2% lidocaine with premedication, a right groin preparation was done.  Using the percutaneous Seldinger technique via the right femoral artery, a left heart catheterization was performed.  Coronary arteriography was performed with 6-French performed coronary catheters.  We used a 6-French JR4 and JL4 catheters to take multiple cineangiograms of the right and left coronary arteries.  After using the JR4 6-French catheter, nitroglycerin was administered because of the possibility of ostial spasm, and following that, we used a 5-French JR4 catheter for additional cineangiograms of the right coronary artery.  A pigtail catheter was placed in the mid abdominal aorta and abdominal aortic injection was performed to rule out abdominal aortic aneurysm, as there was dense calcification in the mid abdominal aorta.,ANALYSIS OF PRESSURE DATA: , Left ventricular end-diastolic pressure was 5 mmHg.  On continuous tracing from the left ventricle to the ascending aorta, there is no gradient across the aortic valve.  The aortic pressures were normal.  Contours of intracardiac pressure were normal.,ANALYSIS OF ANGIOGRAMS:,  Selective cineangiograms were obtained with injection of contrast to the left ventricle, coronary arteries, and mid abdominal aorta.  A pigtail catheter was introduced into the left ventricle and ventriculogram performed in right anterior oblique position.  The mitral valve is competent and demonstrates normal mobility.  The left ventricular cavity is normal in size with excellent contractility.  Aneurysmal dilatation and/or dyskinesia absent.  The aortic valve is tricuspid and normal mobility.  The ascending aorta appeared normal.,Pigtail catheter was introduced in the mid abdominal aorta and placed just above the renal arteries.  An abdominal aortic injection was performed.  Under fluoroscopy, we see heavy dense calcification of the mid abdominal aorta between the renal artery and the bifurcation.  There was some difficulty initially with maneuvering the wire pass that area and it was felt that might be a tight stenosis.  The abdominal aortogram reveals wide patency of that area with mild intimal irregularity.  There is a normal left renal artery, normal right renal artery.  The celiac seems to be normal, but what I believe is the splenic artery seen initially at its origin is normal.  The common left iliac and common right iliac arteries are essentially normal in this area.,CORONARY ANATOMY:,  One notes ostial coronary calcification of the right coronary artery.  Cineangiogram obtained with 6-French JR4 and 5-French JR4 catheters.  Prior to the introduction of the 5-French JR4 nitroglycerin was administered sublingually.  The 6-French JR4 catheters appeared to a show an ostial lesion of over 50%.  There was backwash of dye into the aorta, although there is a fine funneling of the ostium towards the proximal right coronary artery.  In the proximal portion of the right coronary artery just into the Shepherd turn, there is a 50% smooth tapering of the right coronary artery in the proximal third.  Then the artery seems to have a little bit more normal size and it divides into a large posterior descending artery posterolateral branch vessel.  The distal portion of the vessel is free of disease.  The conus branch is seen arising right at the beginning part of the right coronary artery.  We then removed the 6-French catheter and following nitroglycerin and sublingually we placed a 5-French catheter and again finding a stenosis, may be less than 50%.  At the ostium of the right coronary artery, calcification again is identified.  Backwash of dye noted at the proximal lesion, looked about the same 50% along the proximal turn of the Shepherd turn area.,The left coronary artery is normal, although there is a rim of ostial calcification, but there is no tapering or stenosis.  It forms the left anterior descending artery, the ramus branch, and the circumflex artery.,The left anterior descending artery is a very large vessel, very tortuous in its proximal segment, very tortuous in its mid and distal segment.  There appears to be some mild stenosis of 10% in the proximal segment.  It gives off a large diagonal branch in the proximal portion of the left anterior descending artery and it is free of disease.  The remaining portion of the left anterior descending artery is free of disease.  Upon injection of the left coronary artery, we see what I believe is the dye enters probably directly into the left ventricle, but via fistula excluding the coronary sinus, and we get a ventriculogram performed.  I could not identify an isolated area, but it seems to be from the interventricular septal collaterals that this is taking place.,The ramus branch is normal and free of disease.,The left circumflex artery is a tortuous vessel over the lateral wall and terminating in the inferoposterior wall that is free of disease.,The patient has a predominantly right coronary system.  There is no _______ circulation connecting the right and left coronary systems.,The patient tolerated the procedure well.  The catheter was removed.  Hemostasis was achieved.  The patient was transferred to the recovery room in a stable condition.,IMPRESSION:,1.  Excellent left ventricular contractility with normal left ventricular cavity size.,2.  Calcification of the mid abdominal aorta with wide patency of all vessels.  The left and right renal arteries are normal.  The external iliac arteries are normal.,3.  Essentially normal left coronary artery with some type of interventricular septal to left ventricular fistula.,4.  Ostial stenosis of the right coronary artery that appears to be about 50% or greater.  The proximal right coronary artery has 50% stenosis as well.,5.  Coronary calcification is seen under fluoroscopy at the ostia of the left and right coronary arteries.,RECOMMENDATIONS:  ,The patient has heavy calcification of the coronary arteries and continued risk factor management is needed.  The ostial lesion of the right coronary artery may be severe.  It is at least 50%, but it could be worse.  Therefore, she will be evaluated for the possibility of an IVUS and/or _______ analysis of the proximal right coronary artery.  We will reevaluate her stress nuclear study as well.  Continue aggressive medical therapy.',\n",

Surgeon-interpreted fluoroscopy.,OPERATION IN DETAIL:,  After obtaining informed consent from the patient, including a thorough explanation of the risks and benefits of the aforementioned procedure, the patient was taken to the operating room and anesthesia was administered.  Next, a #18-gauge needle was used to locate the subclavian vein.  After aspiration of venous blood, a J wire was inserted through the needle using Seldinger technique.  The needle was withdrawn.  The distal tip location of the J wire was confirmed to be in adequate position with surgeon-interpreted fluoroscopy.  Next, a separate stab incision was made approximately 3 fingerbreadths below the wire exit site.  A subcutaneous tunnel was created, and the distal tip of the Hickman catheter was pulled through the tunnel to the level of the cuff.  The catheter was cut to the appropriate length.  A dilator and sheath were passed over the J wire.  The dilator and J wire were removed, and the distal tip of the Hickman catheter was threaded through the sheath, which was simultaneously withdrawn.  The catheter was flushed and aspirated without difficulty.  The distal tip was confirmed to be in good location with surgeon-interpreted fluoroscopy.  A 2-0 nylon was used to secure the cuff down to the catheter at the skin level.  The skin stab site was closed with a 4-0 Monocryl.

He now presents with significant upper airway resistance and nasal obstruction and is unable to tolerate a CPAP machine.  Therefore, for repair of the above-mentioned deformities including the internal and external nasal valve collapse as well as straightening of the deviated septum, the risks and benefits of the procedure were discussed with him included but not limited to bleeding, infection, septal perforation, need for further surgeries, external deformity, and he desired to proceed with surgery.,DESCRIPTION OF THE PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:  ,The patient was taken to the operating room and laid supine upon the OR table.  After the induction of general endotracheal anesthesia, the nose was decongested using Afrin-soaked pledgets followed by the injection of % lidocaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine in the submucoperichondrial planes bilaterally.  Examination revealed significant deviation of the nasal septum and the bony cartilaginous junction as well as the large septal spur along the floor.  The caudal septum appeared to be now in adequate position.  There was evidence that there had been a previous caudal septal graft on the right nares and it was decided to leave this in place.  Following the evaluation of the nose, a hemitransfixion incision was made on the left revealing a large septal spur consisting primarily down on the floor of the left nostril creating nearly a picture of the vestibular stenosis on the side.  Very carefully, the mucoperichondrial flaps were elevated over this, and it was excised using an osteotome taking care to preserve the 1.5 cm dorsal and caudal strap of the nasal septum and keep it attached to the nasal spine.  Very carefully, the bony cartilaginous junction was identified and a small piece of the bone, where the spur was, was carefully removed.  Following this, it was noted that the cartilaginous region was satisfactory in quantity as well as quality to perform adequate grafting procedures.  Therefore, attention was turned to harvesting the right-sided auricular cartilage, which was done after the region had adequately been prepped and draped in a sterile fashion.  Postauricular incision using a #15 blade, the area of the submucoperichondrial plane was elevated in order to preserve the nice lining and identifiable portion of the cartilage taking care to preserve the ridge of the helix at all times.  This was very carefully harvested.  This area had been injected previously with 1% lidocaine and 1:100,000 epinephrine.  Following this, the cartilage was removed.  It was placed in saline, noted to be fashioned in the bilateral spreader graft and alar rim graft as well as a small piece of crush which was used to be placed along the top of the dorsal irregularity.  The spreader grafts were sutured in place using submucoperichondrial pockets.  After an external septorhinoplasty approach had been performed and reflection of the skin and soft tissue envelope had been performed, adequately revealing straight septum with significant narrowing with what appeared to be detached perhaps from his ipsilateral cartilages rather from his previous surgery.  These were secured in place in the pockets using a 5-0 PDS suture in a mattress fashion in two places.  Following this, attention was turned to placing the alar rim grafts where pockets were created along the caudal aspect of the lower lateral cartilage and just along the alar margin.  Subsequently, the alar rim grafts were placed and extended all the way to the piriform aperture.  This was sutured in place using a 5-0 self-absorbing gut suture.  The lower lateral cartilage has had some inherent asymmetry.  This may have been related to his previous surgery with some asymmetry of the dome; however, this was left in place as he did not desire any changes in the tip region, and there was adequate support.  An endodermal suture was placed just to reenforce the region using a 5-0 PDS suture.  Following all this, the area was closed using a mattress 4-0 plain gut on a Keith needle followed by the application of ***** 5-0 fast-absorbing gut to close the hemitransfixion incision.  Very carefully, the skin and subcutaneous tissue envelopes were reflected.  The curvilinear incision was closed using a Vicryl followed by interrupted 6-0 Prolene sutures.  The marginal incisions were then closed using 5-0 fast-absorbing gut.  Doyle splints were placed and secured down using a nylon suture.  They had ointment also placed on them.  Following this, nasopharynx was suctioned.  There were no further abnormalities noted and everything appeared to be in nice position.  Therefore, an external splint was placed after the application of Steri-Strips.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  He was awakened in the operating room.  He was extubated and taken to the recovery room in stable condition.',\n",

The patient was placed on the operating room table in supine position and given general anesthetic.  Once the patient was under general anesthetic, a careful examination of the shoulder was performed.  It revealed no patholigamentous laxity.  The patient was then carefully positioned into a beach-chair position.  We maintained the natural alignment of the head, neck, and thorax at all times.  The shoulder and upper extremity was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.,Once we fully prepped and draped, we then began the surgery.  We injected the glenohumeral joint with sterile saline with a spinal needle.  This consisted of 60 cc of fluid.  We then made a posterior incision for our portal, 2 cm inferior and 2 cm medial to the posterolateral angle of the acromion.  Through this incision, a blunt trocar and cannula were placed in the glenohumeral joint.  Through the cannula, a camera was placed; and the shoulder was insufflated with sterile saline through a preoperative feed.  We then carefully examined the glenohumeral joint.,We found the articular surface to be in good condition.  There was a superior labral tear (SLAP).  This was extensively debrided using a shaver through an anterior portal.  We also found a full thickness rotator cuff tear.  We then drained the glenohumeral joint.  We redirected our camera into the subacromial space.  An anterolateral portal was made, both superior and inferior.,We then proceeded to perform a subacromial decompression using high-speed shaver.

The patient was taken to cardiac catheterization suite where the right femoral region was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  1% lidocaine solution was used to infiltrate the skin overlying the right femoral artery and vein.  Once adequate anesthesia has been obtained, a thin-walled #18 gauge Argon needle was used to cannulate the right femoral artery.  A steel guidewire was inserted through the needle into the vascular lumen without resistance.  A small nick was then made in the skin.  The pressure was held.  The needle was removed over the guidewire.  Next, a #6 French arterial sheath was then advanced over the guidewire into the vascular lumen without resistance.  The guidewire and dilator were then removed.  The sheath was flushed.  Next, an angulated pigtail catheter was advanced to the level of the ascending aorta under the direct fluoroscopy visualization with the use of a guidewire.  The catheter was then guided into the left ventricle.  The guidewire and dilator were then removed.  The catheter was then flushed.

       " 'PROCEDURES PERFORMED:,1. Left heart catheterization with coronary angiography and left ventricular pressure measurement.,2. Left ventricular angiography was not performed.,3. Right posterior descending artery percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty followed by stenting.,4. Right femoral artery angiography.,5. Perclose to seal the right femoral arteriotomy.,INDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURE:, Patient presenting with a history of coronary artery disease in the past with coronary angiography in the early 1990s. The patient presented with what appeared to be a COPD exacerbation and had mildly positive cardiac enzyme markers suggestive of a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction. He was subsequently dispositioned to the cardiac catheterization lab for further evaluation.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:, After informed consent was obtained, the patient was taken to the cardiac catheterization lab, where his procedure was performed. The patient was appropriately prepped and prepared on the table, after which his right groin was locally anesthetized with 1% lidocaine. Then, a 6-French sheath was inserted into the right femoral artery. Over a standard 0.035 guidewire, coronary angiography and left ventricular pressure measurements were performed using a 6-French JL4 diagnostic catheter to image the left coronary artery, a 6-French JR4 diagnostic catheter to image the right coronary artery, a 6-French angled pigtail catheter to measure left ventricular pressure. At the conclusion of the diagnostic study, the case was progressed to percutaneous coronary intervention, which will be described below. Subsequently, right femoral artery angiography was performed which showed right femoral artery which was free of significant atherosclerotic plaque, and an arteriotomy that was suitable for a closure device. Then, a Perclose was used to seal the right femoral arteriotomy.,HEMODYNAMIC DATA:, The opening aortic pressure was 91/63. The left ventricular pressure was 94/13 with an end-diastolic pressure of 24. Left ventricular ejection fraction was not assessed, as ventriculogram was not performed. The patient did have some elevated creatinine earlier in this hospital course which warranted limitation of contrast where possible.,CORONARY ANGIOGRAM:, The left main coronary artery was angiographically okay. The LAD had mild diffuse disease. There appeared to be distal tapering of the LAD. The left circumflex had mild diffuse disease. In the very distal aspect of the circumflex after OM-3 and OM-4 type branch, there was a long, severely diseased segment that appeared to be chronic and subtotal in one area. The runoff from this area appeared to be a very small PLOM type branch and continuation of a circ which did not appear to supply much territory, and there was not much to salvage by approaching this lesion. The right coronary artery had mild diffuse disease. The PLV branch was 100% occluded at its ostium at the crux. The PDA at the ostium had an 80% stenosis. The PDA was a fairly sizeable vessel with a long course. The right coronary is dominant.,CONCLUSION:, Mild diffuse coronary artery disease with severe distal left circumflex lesion with not much runoff beyond this lesion. This circumflex appears to be chronically diseased and has areas that appear to be subtotal. There is a 100% PLV branch which is also chronic and reported in his angiogram in the 1990s. There is an ostial 80% right PDA lesion. The plan is to proceed with percutaneous intervention to the right PDA.,The case was then progressed to percutaneous intervention of the right PDA. A 6-French JR4 guide catheter with side holes was selected and used to engage the right coronary artery ostium. The lesion was crossed with a long BMW 0.014 guidewire. Then, we ballooned the lesion with a 2.5 x 9 mm Maverick balloon. Subsequently, we stented the lesion with a 2.5 x 16 mm Taxus drug-eluting stent with a nice angiographic result. The patient tolerated the procedure very well, without complications.,ANGIOPLASTY CONCLUSION:, Successful percutaneous intervention with drug-eluting stent placement to the ostium of the PDA.,RECOMMENDATIONS:, Aspirin indefinitely, and Plavix 75 mg p.o. daily for no less than six months. The patient will be dispositioned back to telemetry for further monitoring.,TOTAL MEDICATIONS DURING PROCEDURE:, Versed 1 mg and fentanyl 25 mcg for conscious sedation.

Gauze throat pack was placed and the right buccal vestibule was palpated and area of the abscess was located.  The abscess cavity was aspirated using a 5 mL syringe with an 18-gauge needle.  Approximately 1 mL of purulent material was aspirated that was placed on aerobic and anaerobic cultures.  Culture swabs and the tooth sent to the laboratory for culture and sensitivity testing.,The area in the buccal vestibule was then opened with approximately 1-cm incision.  Blunt dissection was then used to open up the abscess cavity and explore the abscess cavity.  A small amount of additional purulence was drained from it, approximately 1 mL and at this point, tooth #T was extracted by forceps extraction.  Periosteal elevator was used to explore the area near the extraction site.  This was continuous with abscess cavity, so the abscess cavity was allowed to drain into the extraction site.  No drain was placed.  Upon completion of the procedure, the throat pack was removed.  The pharynx was suctioned.

The risks, benefits, and alternatives to right VATS pleurodesis and pleural biopsy were discussed with the patient and his family and they wished to proceed.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:  ,After informed consent was obtained, the patient was brought to the operating room and placed in supine position.  A double-lumen endotracheal tube was placed.  SCDs were also placed and he was given preoperative Kefzol.  The patient was then brought into the right side up, left decubitus position, and the area was prepped and draped in the usual fashion.  A needle was inserted in the axillary line to determine position of the effusion.  At this time, a 10-mm port was placed using the knife and Bovie cautery.  The effusion was drained by placing a sucker into this port site.  Upon feeling the surface of the pleura, there were multiple firm nodules.  An additional anterior port was then placed in similar fashion.  The effusion was then drained with a sucker.  Multiple pleural biopsies were taken with the biopsy device in all areas of the pleura.  Of note, feeling the diaphragmatic surface, it appeared that it was quite nodular, but these nodules felt as though they were on the other side of the diaphragm and not on the pleural surface of the diaphragm concerning for a possibly metastatic disease.  This will be worked up with further imaging study later in his hospitalization.  After the effusion had been drained, 2 cans of talc pleurodesis aerosol were used to cover the lung and pleural surface with talc.  The lungs were then inflated and noted to inflate well.

She was noticed to be in atrial fibrillation, which is a chronic problem for her.  She did not want to have Coumadin started because she said that she has had it before and the INR has had been very difficult to regulate to the point that it was dangerous, but I convinced her to restart the Coumadin again.  I gave her the Coumadin as an outpatient and then the INR was found to be 12.  So, I told her to come to the emergency room to get vitamin K to reverse the anticoagulation.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:,1.

I will repeat it, and if it is still elevated, I will give vitamin K 10 mg in 100 mL of D5W and then send her home and repeat the PT/INR next week.  I believe at this time that it is too risky to use Coumadin in her case because of her age and comorbidities, the multiple medications that she takes and it is very difficult to keep an adequate level of anticoagulation that is safe for her.  She is prone to a fall and this would be a big problem.  We will use one aspirin a day instead of the anticoagulation.  She is aware of the risk of stroke, but she is very scared of the anticoagulation with Coumadin and does not want to use the Coumadin at this time and I understand.  We will see her as an outpatient.',\n",

Informed consent was obtained. Patient received several sets of drops in his/her XXX eye including Ocuflox, Ocular, and pilocarpine. (S)He was taken to the operating room where monitored anesthetic care was initiated. Retrobulbar anesthesia was then administered to the XXX eye using a 50:50 mixture of 2% plain lidocaine and 0.05% Marcaine. The XXX eye was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile ophthalmic fashion and the microscope was brought in position. A Lieberman lid speculum was used to provide exposure. Vannas scissors and smooth forceps were used to create a 6 mm limbal peritomy superiorly. This was dissected posteriorly with Vannas scissors to produce a fornix based conjunctival flap. Residual episcleral vessels were cauterized with Eraser-tip cautery. Sponges soaked in mitomycin C 0.3 mm per cc were then placed underneath the conjunctival flap and allowed to sit there for 3 minutes checked against the clock. Sponges were removed and area was copiously irrigated with balanced salt solution. A Super blade was then used to fashion a partial thickness limbal based trapezoidal scleral flap. This was dissected anteriorly with a crescent blade to clear cornea. A temporal paracentesis was then made. Scleral flap was lifted and a Super blade was used to enter the anterior chamber. A Kelly-Descemet punch was used to remove a block of limbal tissue. DeWecker scissors were used to perform a surgical iridectomy. The iris was then carefully reposited back into place and the iridectomy was visible through the clear cornea. A scleral flap was then re- approximated back on the bed. One end of the scleral flap was closed with a #10-0 nylon suture in interrupted fashion and the knot was buried. The other end of the scleral flap was closed with #10-0 nylon suture in interrupted fashion and the knot was buried. The anterior chamber was then refilled with balanced salt solution and a small amount of fluid was noted to trickle out of the scleral flap with slow shallowing of the chamber. Therefore it was felt that another #10-0 nylon suture should be placed and it was therefore placed in interrupted fashion half way between each of the end sutures previously placed. The anterior chamber was then again refilled with balanced salt solution and it was noted that there was a small amount of fluid tricking out of the scleral flap and the pressure was felt to be adequate in the anterior chamber. Conjunctiva was then re-approximated to the limbus and closed with #9-0 Vicryl suture on a TG needle at each of the peritomy ends. Then a horizontal mattress style #9-0 Vicryl suture was placed at the center of the conjunctival peritomy. The conjunctival peritomy was checked for any leaks and was noted to be watertight using Weck- cel sponge. The anterior chamber was inflated and there was noted that the superior bleb was well formed. At the end of the case, the pupil was round, the chamber was formed and the pressure was felt to be adequate. Speculum and drapes were carefully removed. Ocuflox and Maxitrol ointment were placed over the eye. Atropine was also placed over the eye. Then an eye patch and eye shield were placed over the eye. The patient was taken to the recovery room in good condition. There were no complications.',\n",

Flow to right upper lobe more than left upper lobe from collaterals arising from branches of the aortic arch.,PROCEDURE (S):, Right heart and left heart catheterization by way of right femoral artery, right femoral vein, and right internal jugular vein.,I. PROCEDURES:, XXXXXX was brought to the catheterization lab and was anesthetized by anesthesia. He was intubated. His supplemental oxygen was weaned to 24%, on which all of his hemodynamics were obtained. The patient was prepped and draped in the routine sterile fashion, including both groins and the right neck. Xylocaine was administered in the right femoral area. A 6-French sheath was introduced into the right femoral vein percutaneously without complication. A 4-French sheath was introduced into the right femoral artery percutaneously without complication. A 4-French pigtail catheter was introduced and passed to the abdominal aorta.,Dr. Hayes, using the SiteRite device, introduced a 5-French sheath into the right internal jugular vein without complication.,A 5-French wedge catheter was introduced through the sheath in the right internal jugular vein and was passed to the left pulmonary artery and further to the left pulmonary capillary wedge position. This catheter would not pass to the right pulmonary artery. The wedge catheter was removed. A 5-French IMA catheter was then introduced and passed to the right pulmonary artery. After right pulmonary artery pressure was measured, this catheter was removed.,The 5 wedge catheter was advanced through the right femoral sheath and was passed to the following chambers or vessels: Inferior vena cava, right atrium, left atrium, and right ventricle.,The previously introduced 4 pigtail catheter was advanced to the ascending aorta. Simultaneous right ventricular and ascending aortic pressures were measured. A pullback from ascending aorta to descending aorta was then performed. Simultaneous measurements of right ventricular and descending aortic pressures were measured.,The wedge catheter was removed. A 5-French Berman catheter was advanced down the Glenn shunt to the right pulmonary artery, where a pullback from right pulmonary artery to Glenn shunt was performed. An injection was then performed using Omnipaque 16 mL at 8 mL per second with the Berman catheter positioned in the Glenn shunt. The 5-French Berman was removed.,A 6-French Berman was introduced through the right femoral vein sheath and was advanced to the right ventricle. A right ventriculogram was performed using Omnipaque 18 mL at 12 mL per second. The Berman catheter was pulled back to the inferior vena cava, where an inferior vena cavagram was performed using Omnipaque 10 mL at 8 mL per second.,The 4-French pigtail catheter was advanced to the ascending aorta and an ascending aortogram was performed using Omnipaque 16 mL at 12 mL per second.,Following the ascending angiograms, two kidneys and a bladder were noted. The catheters and sheaths were removed, and hemostasis was obtained by direct pressure. The estimated blood loss was less than 30 mL, and none was replaced. Heparin was administered following placement of all of the sheaths. Pulse oximetry saturation, pulse in the right foot, and EKG were monitored continuously.,II. PRESSURES:,A. Left pulmonary artery, mean of 11; left capillary wedge, mean of 9; main pulmonary artery, mean of 12; right pulmonary artery, mean of 10; descending aorta, 75/45, mean of 57; right atrium, A6 to 9, V6 to 8, mean 7; left atrium, mean 8; inferior vena cava, mean 7.,B. Ascending aorta, 65/35, with a simultaneous right ventricular pressure of 70/10; descending aorta, 60/35, with a right ventricular pressure of 72/10.,C. Pullbacks, left pulmonary artery to main pulmonary artery, mean of 11 to mean of 12; main pulmonary artery to Glenn, mean of 12 to mean of 13; right pulmonary artery to Glenn, mean of 12 to mean of 13; ascending aorta 68/35 to descending aorta 62/35.,INTERPRETATION:, Right and left pulmonary artery pressures are appropriate for this situation. There is a gradient of, at most, 2 mmHg on pullback from both the right and left pulmonary arteries to the Glenn shunt. The left atrial mean pressure is normal. Right ventricular end-diastolic pressure is, at most, slightly elevated. There is a trivial gradient between the right ventricle and ascending aorta consistent with trivial neo-aortic valve stenosis. There is a roughly 10-mm gradient between the right ventricle and descending aorta, consistent with additional coarctation of the aorta. On pullback from ascending to descending aorta, there is a 6-mmHg gradient between the two. Systemic blood pressure is normal.,III. OXIMETRY:, Superior vena cava 65, right pulmonary artery 67, left pulmonary artery 65, left atrium 96, right atrium 87, inferior vena cava 69, aorta 86, right ventricle 83.,INTERPRETATION:, Systemic arteriovenous oxygenation difference is normal, consistent with a normal cardiac output. Left atrial saturation is fairly normal, consistent with normal oxygenation in the lungs. The saturation falls passing from the left atrium to the right atrium and further to the right ventricle, consistent with mixing of pulmonary venous return and inferior vena cava return, as would be expected in this patient.,IV. SPECIAL PROCEDURE (S):, None done.,V. CALCULATIONS:,Please see the calculation sheet. Calculations were based upon an assumed oxygen consumption. The _____ saturation used was 67%, with a pulmonary artery saturation of 65%, a left atrial saturation of 96%, and an aortic saturation of 86%. Using the above information, the pulmonary to systemic flow ratio was 0.6. Systemic blood flow was 5.1 liters per minute per meter squared. Pulmonary blood flow was 3.2 liters per minute per meter squared. Systemic resistance was 9.8 Wood's units times meter squared, which is mildly diminished. Pulmonary resistance was 2.5 Wood's units times meter squared, which is in the normal range.,VI. ANGIOGRAPHY:, The injection to the Glenn shunt demonstrates a wide-open Glenn connection. The right pulmonary artery is widely patent, without stenosis. The proximal portion of the left pulmonary artery is significantly narrowed, but does open up near its branch point. The right pulmonary artery measures 6.5, the left pulmonary artery measures 3.0 mm. The aorta at the diaphragm on a later injection was 5.5 mm. There is a small collateral off the innominate vein passing to the left upper lobe. Flow to both upper lobes is diminished versus lower lung fields. There is normal return of the pulmonary veins from the right, with simultaneous filling of the left atrium and right atrium. There is normal return of the left lower pulmonary vein and left upper pulmonary vein. There is some reflux of dye into the inferior vena cava from the right atrium.,The right ventriculogram demonstrates a heavily pedunculated right ventricle with somewhat depressed right ventricular systolic function. The calculated ejection fraction from the LAO projection is only mildly diminished at 59%. There is no significant tricuspid regurgitation. The neo-aortic valve appears to open well with no stenosis. The ascending aorta is dilated. There is mild narrowing of the aorta at the isthmal area. On some projections, there appears to be a partial duplication of the aortic arch, probably secondary to this patient's style of Norwood reconstruction. There is some filling of the right upper and left upper lobes from collateral blood flow, with the left being more opacified than the right.,The inferior vena cavagram demonstrates normal return of the inferior vena cava to the right atrium.,The ascending aortogram demonstrates trivial aortic insufficiency, which is probably catheter-induced. The coronary arteries are poorly seen. Again, a portion of the aorta appears to be partially duplicated. There is faint opacification of the left upper lung from collateral blood flow. The above-mentioned narrowing of the aortic arch is again noted.\",\n",

       " \"HISTORY: , The patient is an 86-year-old woman with a history of aortic valve replacement in the past with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation who was admitted yesterday with the recurrence of such in a setting of hypokalemia, incomplete compliance with obstructive sleep apnea therapy with CPAP, chocolate/caffeine ingestion and significant mental stress.  Despite repletion of her electrolytes and maintenance with Diltiazem IV she has maintained atrial fibrillation.  I have discussed in detail with the patient regarding risks, benefits, and alternatives of the procedure.  After an in depth discussion of the procedure (please see my initial consultation for further details) I asked the patient this morning if she would like me to repeat that as that discussion had happened yesterday.  The patient declined.  I invited questions for her which she stated she had none and wanted to go forward with the cardioversion which seemed appropriate.,PROCEDURE NOTE: , The appropriate time-out procedure was performed as per Medical Center protocol including proper identification of the patient, physician, procedure, documentation, and there were no safety issues identified by myself nor the staff.  The patient participated actively in this.  She received a total of 4 mg of Versed then and 50 micrograms of fentanyl with utilizing titrated conscious sedation with good effect.  She was placed in the supine position and hands free patches had previously been placed in the AP position and she received one synchronized cardioversion attempt after Diltiazem drip had been turned off with successful resumption of normal sinus rhythm.  This was confirmed on 12 lead EKG.,IMPRESSION/PLAN: , Successful resumption of normal sinus rhythm from recurrent atrial fibrillation.  The patient's electrolytes are now normal and that will need close watching to avoid hypokalemia in the future, as well as she has been previously counseled for strict adherence to sleep apnea therapy with CPAP and perhaps repeat sleep evaluation would be appropriate to titrate her settings, as well as avoidance of caffeine ingestion including chocolate and minimization of mental stress.  She will be discharged on her usual robust AV nodal antiarrhythmic therapy with sotalol 80 mg p.o. b.i.d., metoprolol 50 mg p.o. b.i.d., Diltiazem CD 240 mg p.o. daily and digoxin 0.125 mg p.o. daily and to be clear she does have a permanent pacemaker implanted.

Bimanual exam was not able to be performed secondary to the vaginal stenosis and completely intact hymen.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , After informed consent was obtained, the patient was taken back to the Operative Suite, prepped and draped, and placed in the dorsal lithotomy position.  A 1 cm skin incision was made in the infraumbilical vault.  While tenting up the abdominal wall, the Veress needle was inserted without difficulty and the abdomen was insufflated.  This was done using appropriate flow and volume of CO2.  The #11 step trocar was then placed without difficulty.  The above findings were confirmed.  A #12 mm port was then placed approximately 2 cm above the pubic symphysis under direct visualization.  Two additional ports were placed, one on the left lateral aspect of the abdominal wall and one on the right lateral aspect of the abdominal wall.  Both #12 step ports were done under direct visualization.  Using a grasper, the mass was tented up at the inferior pelvic ligament and the LigaSure was placed across this and several bites were taken with good visualization while ligating.  The left ovary was then placed in an Endocatch bag and removed through the suprapubic incision.  The skin was extended around this incision and the fascia was extended using the Mayo scissors.  The specimen was removed intact in the Endocatch bag through this site.  Prior to desufflation of the abdomen, the site where the left adnexa was removed was visualized to be hemostatic.  All the port sites were hemostatic as well.  The fascia of the suprapubic incision was then repaired using a running #0 Vicryl stitch on a UR6 needle.  The skin was then closed with #4-0 undyed Vicryl in a subcuticular fashion.  The remaining incisions were also closed with #4-0 undyed Vicryl in a running fashion after all instruments were removed and the abdomen was completely desufflated.  Steri-Strips were placed on each of the incisions.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  Sponge, lap, and needle count were x2.

       " 'HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  ,This is a 53-year-old man, who presented to emergency room with multiple complaints including pain from his hernia, some question of blood in his stool, nausea, and vomiting, and also left lower extremity pain.  At the time of my exam, he states that his left lower extremity pain has improved considerably.  He apparently had more significant paresthesias in the past and now he feels that the paresthesias have improved considerably.  He does have a history of multiple medical problems including atrial fibrillation, he is on Coumadin, which is currently subtherapeutic, multiple CVAs in the past, peripheral vascular disease, and congestive heart failure.  He has multiple chronic history of previous ischemia of his large bowel in the past.,PHYSICAL EXAM,VITAL SIGNS:  Currently his temperature is 98.2, pulse is 95, and blood pressure is 138/98.,HEENT:  Unremarkable.,LUNGS:  Clear.,CARDIOVASCULAR:  An irregular rhythm.,ABDOMEN:  Soft.,EXTREMITIES:  His upper extremities are well perfused.  He has palpable radial and femoral pulses.  He does not have any palpable pedal pulses in either right or left lower extremity.  He does have reasonable capillary refill in both feet.  He has about one second capillary refill on both the right hand and left lower extremities and his left foot is perhaps little cool, but it is relatively warm.  Apparently, this was lot worst few hours ago.  He describes significant pain and pallor, which he feels has improved and certainly clinically at this point does not appear to be as significant.,IMPRESSION AND PLAN: , This gentleman with a history of multiple comorbidities as detailed above had what sounds clinically like acute exacerbation of chronic peripheral vascular disease, essentially related to spasm versus a small clot, which may have been lysed to some extent.  He currently has a viable extremity and viable foot, but certainly has significant making compromised flow.  It is unclear to me whether this is chronic or acute, and whether he is a candidate for any type of intervention.  He certainly would benefit from an angiogram to better to define his anatomy and anticoagulation in the meantime.  Given his potential history of recent lower GI bleeding, he has been evaluated by GI to see whether or not he is a candidate for heparinization.  We will order an angiogram for the next few hours and followup on those results to better define his anatomy and to determine whether or not if any interventions are appropriate.  Again, at this point, he has no pain, relatively rapid capillary refill, and relatively normal motor function suggesting a viable extremity.  We will follow him along closely.',\n",

There were no adnexal masses appreciated.  Intraabdominal findings revealed a small uterus approximately 2 cm in size.  The ovaries were atrophic consistent with menopause.  The liver margins and stomach were palpated and found to be normal.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , After informed consent was obtained, the patient was taken back to the operating suite and administered a spinal anesthesia for postoperative pain control.  She was then placed in the dorsal lithotomy position and administered general anesthesia.  She was then prepped and draped in the sterile fashion and an indwelling Foley catheter was placed in her bladder.  At this point, the patient was evaluated for a possible vaginal hysterectomy.  She was nulliparous and the pelvis was narrow.  After the anesthesia was administered, the patient was repeatedly stooling and therefore because of these two reasons, the decision was made to do an abdominal hysterectomy.  After the patient was prepped and draped, a Pfannenstiel skin incision was made approximately 2 cm above the pubic symphysis.  The second scalpel was used to dissect out to the underlying layer of fascia.  The fascia was incised in the midline and extended laterally using the Mayo scissors.  The superior aspect of the rectus fascia was grasped with Ochsners, tented up and underlying layer of rectus muscle was dissected off bluntly as well as with Mayo scissors.  In a similar fashion, the inferior portion of the rectus fascia was tented up, dissected off bluntly as well as with Mayo scissors.  The rectus muscle was then separated bluntly in the midline and the peritoneum was identified and entered with the Metzenbaum.  The peritoneal incision was extended superiorly and inferiorly with good visualization of the bladder.  At this point, the above findings were noted and the GYN Balfour retractor was placed.  Moist laparotomy sponges were used to pack the bowel out of the operative field.  The bladder blade and the extension for the retractor were then placed.  An Allis was used on the uterus for retraction.  The round ligaments were then identified, clamped with two hemostats and transected and then suture ligated.  The anterior portion of the broad ligament was dissected along vesicouterine resection.  The bladder was then dissected off the anterior cervix and vagina without difficulty.  The infundibulopelvic ligaments on both sides were then doubly clamped using hemostats, transected and suture ligated with #0 Vicryl suture.  The uterine vessels on both sides were skeletonized and clamped with two hemostats and transected and suture ligated with #0 Vicryl.  Good hemostasis was assured.  The cardinal ligaments on both sides were clamped using a curved hemostat, transected and suture ligated with #0 Vicryl.  Good hemostasis was obtained.  Two hemostats were then placed just under the cervix meeting in the midline.  The uterus and cervix were then _______ off using a scalpel.  This was handed and sent to Pathology for evaluation.  Using #0 Vicryl suture, the right vaginal cuff angle was closed and affixed to the ipsilateral cardinal ligament.  A baseball stitch was then used to close the cuff to the midline.  The same was done to the left vaginal cuff angle, which was affixed to the ipsilateral and cardinal ligaments.  The baseball stitch was used to close the cuff to the midline.  The hemostats were removed and the cuff was closed and good hemostasis was noted.  The uterosacral ligaments were also transfixed to the cuff and brought out for good support by using a #0 Vicryl suture through each uterosacral ligament and incorporating this into the vaginal cuff.  The pelvis was then copiously irrigated with warm normal saline.  Good support and hemostasis was noted.  The bowel packing was then removed and the GYN Balfour retractor was moved.  The peritoneum was then repaired with #0 Vicryl in a running fashion.  The fascia was then closed using #0 Vicryl in a running fashion, marking the first stitch and first last stitch in a lateral to medial fashion.  The skin was then closed with #4-0 undyed Vicryl in a subcuticular closure and an Op-Site was placed over this.  The patient was then brought out of general anesthesia and extubated.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  Sponge, lap, and needle counts were correct x2.  She will follow up postoperatively as an inpatient.',\n",

There was presence of hourglass constriction of the ulnar nerve.,PROCEDURE: , The patient was brought to the operating room and once an adequate general anesthesia was achieved, his left upper extremity was prepped and draped in standard sterile fashion.  A sterile tourniquet was positioned and tourniquet was inflated at 250 mmHg.  Perioperative antibiotics were infused.  Time-out procedure was called.  The medial epicondyle and the olecranon tip were well palpated.  The incision was initiated at equidistant between the olecranon and the medial epicondyle extending 3-4 cm proximally and 6-8 cm distally.  The ulnar nerve was identified proximally.  It was mobilized with a blunt and a sharp dissection proximally to the arcade of Struthers, which was released sharply.  The roof of the cubital tunnel was then incised and the nerve was mobilized distally to its motor branches.  The ulnar nerve was well-isolated before it entered the cubital tunnel.  The arch of the FCU was well defined.  The fascia was elevated from the nerve and both the FCU fascia and the Osborne fascia were divided protecting the nerve under direct visualization.  Distally, the dissection was carried between the 2 heads of the FCU.  Decompression of the nerve was performed between the heads of the FCU.  The muscular branches were well protected.  Similarly, the cutaneous branches in the arm and forearm were well protected.  The venous plexus proximally and distally were well protected.  The nerve was well mobilized from the cubital tunnel preserving the small longitudinal vessels accompanying it.  Proximally, multiple vascular leashes were defined near the incision of the septum into the medial epicondyle, which were also protected.  Once the in situ decompression of the ulnar nerve was performed proximally and distally, the elbow was flexed and extended.  There was no evidence of any subluxation.  Satisfactory decompression was performed.  Tourniquet was released.  Hemostasis was achieved.  Subcutaneous layer was closed with 2-0 Vicryl and skin was approximated with staples.  A well-padded dressing was applied.  The patient was then extubated and transferred to the recovery room in stable condition.  There were no intraoperative complications noted.

Usual benefits, alternatives, and risks of the procedure had been discussed with the patient, she was agreeable to proceed.  The patient was prepped, draped, and anesthetized in the usual manner.  Using modified Seldinger technique a 6 French introducer sheath inserted into the right femoral artery.  Next, 6 French 3D right coronary catheter was inserted and right coronary angiogram was obtained in various projections.  Next, a 6 French JL4.0 left coronary catheter was inserted and left coronary angiogram was obtained in various projections.  Next, 4 French pigtail catheter was inserted into left ventricle under fluoroscopic guidance.  Left ventricular angiogram was performed.

Angiographically the mid left anterior descending artery and distal left anterior descending artery demonstrates systolic compression of the vessel lumen, consistent with myocardial bridging.  The degree of myocardial bridging appears moderate in the mid vessel and mild in the distal segment.  Otherwise, there is no evidence of atherosclerotic obstruction.,4.  ,CIRCUMFLEX ARTERY: , The circumflex gives rise to two large extremely tortuous marginal vessels that extend towards the apex.  Angiographically, the circumflex artery is normal.,CONCLUSION: , This is a 70-year-old female with above clinical and cardiovascular history, who has angiographic evidence of a large anterior apical and inferior apical wall motion abnormality with angiographically patent coronary arteries with two segments of myocardial bridging involving the mid and distal left anterior descending artery.  These angiographic findings are consistent with Takasubo syndrome, aka apical ballooning syndrome.  The patient will be treated medically.',\n",

The patient has attempted conservative correction and injections with minimal improvement.  The patient desires surgical correction at this time.  The patient states that her pain has been increasingly worsening with activity and with time and it is currently difficult for her to ambulate and wear shoes.  At this time, the patient desires surgical intervention and correction.  The risks versus benefits of the procedure have been explained to the patient in detail by Dr. X and consent was obtained.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , After an IV was instituted by the Department of Anesthesia in the preoperative holding area, the patient was taken to the Operating Suite via cart and placed on the operating table in the supine position.  A safety strap was placed across her waist for protection.,Next, a pneumatic ankle tourniquet was applied around her left ankle over copious amounts of Webril for the patient's protection.  After adequate IV sedation was administered by the Department of Anesthesia, a total of 20 cc of a mixture of 4.5 cc of 1% lidocaine plain, 4.5 cc of 0.5% Marcaine plain, and 1 cc of Solu-Medrol per 10 cc dose was administered to the patient for local anesthesia.  The foot was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile orthopedic manner.  The foot was then elevated and a tourniquet was then placed at 230 mmHg after applying Esmarch bandage.  The foot was then lowered down the operative field and sterile stockinet was draped.  The stockinet was then reflected.  Attention was then directed to the second intermetatarsal interspace.  After testing the anesthesia, a 4 cm incision was placed using a #10 blade over the dorsal surface of the foot in the second intermetatarsal space beginning from proximal third of the metatarsals distally to and beyond the metatarsal head.  Then, using #15 blade the incision was deepened through the skin into the subcutaneous tissue.  Care was taken to identify and avoid or to cauterize any local encountered vascular structures.  Incision was deepened using the combination of blunt and dull dissection using Mayo scissors, hemostat, and a #15 blade.  The incision was deepened distally down to the level of the deep transverse metatarsal ligament which was reflected and exposure of the intermetatarsal space was appreciated.  The individual branches of the plantar digital nerve were identified extending into the second and third digits plantarly.  These endings were dissected distally and cut at their most distal portions.  Following this, the nerve was dissected proximally into the common nerve and dissected proximally into the proximal portion of the intermetatarsal space.  Using careful meticulous dissection, there was noted to a be a enlarged bulbous mass of fibers and nerve tissue embedded with the adipose tissue.  This was also cut and removed.  The proximal portion of the nerve stump was identified and care was taken to suture this into the lumbrical muscle to leave no free nerve ending exposed.  Following this, the interspace was irrigated with copious amounts of sterile saline and interspace explored for any other portions of nerve which may been missed on the previous dissection.  It was noted that no other portions of the nerve were detectable and the proximal free nerve ending was embedded and found to be ________ the lumbrical muscle belly.  Following this, the interspace was packed using iodoform gauze packing and was closed in layers with the packing extruding from the wound.  Attention was then directed to the third interspace where in a manner as mentioned before.  A dorsal linear incision which measured 5 cm was made over the third interspace extending from the proximal portion of the metatarsal distally to the metatarsal head.  Like before, using a combination of blunt and dull dissection, with sharp dissection the incision was deepened down with care taken to cauterize all retracting vascular structures which were encountered.,The incision was deepened down to the level of the subcutaneous tissue and then down deeper to the interspace of the third and fourth metatarsal.  The dissection was deepened distally down to the level of the transverse intermetatarsal ligament, where upon this was reflected and the nerve fibers to the third and fourth digit plantarly were identified.  These were once again dissected distally out and transected at their most distal portions.  Care was then taken to dissect the nerve proximally into the proximal metatarsal region.  No other branches of the nerve were identified and the nerve in its entirety along with fibrous tissue encountered in the area was removed.  The proximal portion of the nerve which remained was not large enough to suture into lumbrical muscle as was done in the previous interspace.  Half of the nerve was transected proximally as was feasible and no exposed ending was noted.  Incision was then flushed and irrigated using sterile saline.  Following this, the incision wound was packed with iodoform gauze packed and closed in layers using as before #4-0 Vicryl and #4-0 nylon suture.,Following this, attention was directed to the fifth metatarsal head where a lateral 4 cm incision was placed along the lateral distal shaft and head of the fifth metatarsal using a fresh #10 blade.  The incision was then deepened using #15 blade down to the level of the subcutaneous tissue.  Care was taken to reflect any neurovascular structures which were encountered.  Following this the incision was deepened down to the level of the periosteum and periosteum was reflected, using the sharp dissection, to expose the head of the metatarsal along with the neck region.  After adequate exposure of the fifth metatarsal head was achieved, an oblique incision directed from distal lateral to proximal medial in a sagittal plane was performed and the head of the fifth metatarsal was shifted medially.  Following this, an OrthoSorb pin was retrograded through the fifth metatarsal head into the neck of the fifth metatarsal and was cut off first with the lateral surfaces of bone.  OrthoSorb pin was noted to be intact and the fifth metatarsal head was in good alignment and position.  Following this, the sagittal saw and the #138 blade were used to provide rasping and smoothing of the sharp acute edges of bone laterally.  Following this, the periosteum was closed using #4-0 Vicryl and the skin was closed in layers using #4-0 Vicryl and closed with running subcuticular #4-0 Monocryl suture.  Upon completion of this, the foot was noted to be in good position with good visual alignment of the fifth metatarsal head and digit.  The incisions in foot were then ________ draped in the normal manner using Owen silk, 4 x 4s, Kling, and Kerlix and covered with Coban bandage.  The tourniquet was then deflated with the total tourniquet time of 103 minutes at 230 mmHg and immediate hyperemia was noted to end digits one through five of the left foot.,The patient was then transferred to the cart and was escorted to the Postanesthesia Care Unit with vital signs stable and vascular status intact.  The patient tolerated the procedure well without any complications.  The patient was then given prescriptions for Vicoprofen #30 and Augmentin #14 to be taken twice daily.  The patient was instructed to followup with Dr. X after the weekend on Tuesday in his office.  The patient also given postoperative instructions and was placed in a postoperative shoe and instructed to limit weightbearing to the heel only, ice and elevate her foot 20 minutes every hour as tolerated.  The patient also instructed to take her medications and prescriptions as directed.  She was given the emergency contact numbers.

He was positioned in the modified beach chair position on the operative table utilizing the shoulder apparatus.  The left shoulder and upper extremities were then prepped and draped in the usual manner.  A longitudinal incision was made extending from a point just lateral to the coracoid down towards deltoid tuberosity of the humerus.  This incision was taken down through the skin and subcutaneous tissues were split utilizing the coag cautery.  Hemostasis was achieved with the cautery.  The deltoid fascia were identified, skin flaps were then created.  The deltopectoral interval was identified and the deltoid split just lateral to the cephalic vein.  The deltoid was then retracted.  There was marked hematoma and swelling within the subdeltoid bursa.  This area was removed with rongeurs.  The biceps tendon was identified which was the landmark for the rotator interval.  Mayo scissors was utilized to split the remaining portion of the rotator interval.  The greater tuberosity portion with the rotator cuff was identified.  Excess bone was removed from the greater tuberosity side to allow for closure later.  The lesser tuberosity portion with the subscapularis was still attached to the humeral head, therefore, osteotome was utilized to separate the lesser tuberosity from the humeral head fragment.,Excess bone was removed from the lesser tuberosity as well.  Both of these were tagged with Ethibond sutures for later.  The humeral head was delivered out of the wound.  It was localized to the area of the anteroinferior glenoid region.  The glenoid was then inspected, and noted to be intact.  The fracture was at the level of the surgical neck on the proximal humerus.  The canal was repaired with the broaches.  An #8 stem was chosen as it was going to be cemented into place.  The trial stem was impacted into position and the shaft of the bone marked with the cautery to the appropriate retroversion.  Trial reduction was performed.  The 48 x 21 mm head was the most appropriate size, matching the patient's as well as the soft tissue tension on the shoulder.  At this point, the wound was copiously irrigated with gentamycin solution.  The canal was copiously irrigated as well and suctioned dry.  Methyl methacrylate cement was mixed.  The cement gun was filled and the canal was filled with the cement.  The #8 stem was then impacted into place and held in the position in the appropriate retroversion until the cement had cured.  Excess cement was removed by sharp dissection.  Prior to cementation of the stem, a hole was drilled in the shaft of proximal humerus and #2 fiber wires were placed through this hole for closure later.  Once the cement was cured, the modular head was impacted on to the Morse taper.  It was stable and the shoulder was reduced.  The lesser tuberosity was then reapproximated back to the original site utilizing the #2 fiber wire suture that was placed in the humeral shaft as well as the holes in the humeral implant.  The greater tuberosity portion with rotator cuff was also attached to the implant as well as the shaft of the humerus utilizing #2 fiber wires as well.  The rotator interval was closed with #2 fiber wire in an interrupted fashion.  The biceps tendon was ________ within this closure.  The wound was copiously irrigated with gentamycin solution, suctioned dry.  The deltoid fascia was then approximated with interrupted #2-0 Vicryl suture.  Subcutaneous layer was approximated with interrupted #2-0 Vicryl and skin approximated with staples.  Subcutaneous tissues were infiltrated with 0.25% Marcaine solution.  A bulky dressing was applied to the wound followed by application of a large arm sling.  Circulatory status was intact in the extremity at the completion of the case.  The patient was then transferred to recovery room in apparent satisfactory condition.\",\n",
       " 'REASON FOR CONSULTATION: , This 92-year-old female states that last night she had a transient episode of slurred speech and numbness of her left cheek for a few hours.  However, the chart indicates that she had recurrent TIAs x3 yesterday, each lasting about 5 minutes with facial drooping and some mental confusion.  She had also complained of blurred vision for several days.  She was brought to the emergency room last night, where she was noted to have a left carotid bruit and was felt to have recurrent TIAs.,CURRENT MEDICATIONS: , The patient is on Lanoxin, amoxicillin, Hydergine, Cardizem, Lasix, Micro-K and a salt-free diet.  ,SOCIAL HISTORY: , She does not smoke or drink alcohol.,FINDINGS:  ,Admission CT scan of the head showed a densely calcified mass lesion of the sphenoid bone, probably representing the benign osteochondroma seen on previous studies.  CBC was normal, aside from a hemoglobin of 11.2.  ECG showed atrial fibrillation.  BUN was 22, creatinine normal, CPK normal, glucose normal, electrolytes normal.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: , On examination, the patient is noted to be alert and fully oriented.  She has some impairment of recent memory.  She is not dysphasic, or apraxic.  Speech is normal and clear.  The head is noted to be normocephalic.  Neck is supple.  Carotid pulses are full bilaterally, with left carotid bruit.  Neurologic exam shows cranial nerve function II through XII to be intact, save for some slight flattening of the left nasolabial fold.  Motor examination shows no drift of the outstretched arms.  There is no tremor or past-pointing.  Finger-to-nose and heel-to-shin performed well bilaterally.  Motor showed intact neuromuscular tone, strength, and coordination in all limbs.  Reflexes 1+ and symmetrical, with bilateral plantar flexion, absent jaw jerk, no snout.  Sensory exam is intact to pinprick touch, vibration, position, temperature, and graphesthesia.,IMPRESSION: , Neurological examination is normal, aside from mild impairment of recent memory, slight flattening of the left nasolabial fold, and left carotid bruit.  She also has atrial fibrillation, apparently chronic.  In view of her age and the fact that she is in chronic atrial fibrillation, I would suspect that she most likely has had an embolic phenomenon as the cause of her TIAs.,RECOMMENDATIONS:,  I would recommend conservative management with antiplatelet agents unless a near occlusion of the carotid arteries is demonstrated, in which case you might consider it best to do an angiography and consider endarterectomy.  In view of her age, I would be reluctant to recommend Coumadin anticoagulation.  I will be happy to follow the patient with you.',\n",

There were two 4.0 cancellous partially-threaded screws placed.,GROSS FINDINGS:  ,Include a comminuted fracture involving the lateral malleolus as well as a medial and posterior malleolus fracture as well.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , The patient is an 87-year-old Caucasian female who presented to ABCD General Hospital Emergency Room complaining of right ankle pain status post a trip and fall.  The patient noted while walking with a walker, apparently tripped and fell.  The patient had significant comorbidities, seen and evaluated by the Emergency Room Department as well as Department of Orthopedics while in the Emergency Room.  At that time, a closed reduction was performed and she was placed in a Robert-Jones splint.  After complete medical workup and clearance, we elected to take her to the operating room for definitive care.,PROCEDURE:  ,After all potential complications and risks as well as risks and benefits of the above-mentioned procedure was discussed at length with the patient and family, informed consent was obtained.  The upper extremity was then confirmed with the operating surgeon, the patient, the nursing staff and Department of Anesthesia.  The patient was then transferred to preoperative area in the Operative Suite #3 and placed on the operating room table in supine position.  At this time, the Department of Anesthesia administered spinal anesthetic to the patient as well as sedation.  All bony prominences were well padded at this time.  A nonsterile tourniquet was placed on the right upper thigh of the patient.  This was then removed and the right lower extremity was sterilely prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  The right lower extremity was then elevated and exsanguinated using Esmarch and tourniquet was then placed to 325 mmHg and kept up to a total of 75 minutes.  Next, after all bony and soft tissue landmarks were identified, a 6 cm longitudinal incision was made directly over this vestibule on the right ankle.  A sharp dissection was carefully taken down to the level of bone taking care to protect the neurovascular structures.  Once the bone was reached, the fractured site was identified.  The bony ends were then opened and divided of all hematoma as well as excess periosteum within the fracture site.  The wound was copiously irrigated and dried.  Next, the fracture was then reduced in anatomic position.  There was noted to be quite a bit of comminution as well as soft overall status of the bone.  It was held in place with reduction forceps.  A six hole one-third tubular Synthes plate was then selected for instrumentation.  It was contoured using ________ and placed on the lateral aspect of the distal fibula.  Next, the three most proximal holes were sequentially drilled using a 2.5 mm drill bed, depth gauged and then a 3.5 mm fully threaded cortical screw was placed in each.  The most proximal was a 12 mm and the next two were 16 mm in length.  Next, the three most distal holes were sequentially drilled using a 2.5 mm drill bed, depth gauged, and a 4.0 cancellous screw was placed in each hole.  The most distal with a 20 mm and two most proximal were 18 mm in length.  Next the Xi-scan was used to visualize the hardware placement as well as the fracture reduction appeared to be in good anatomic position, all hardware was in good position.  There was no lateralization of the joints.  Attention was then directed towards the medial aspect of the ankle.  Again, after all bony and soft tissue landmarks were identified, a 4 cm longitudinal incision was made directly over the medial malleolus.  Again, the dissection was carefully taken down the level of the fracture site.  The retractors were then placed to protect all neurovascular structures.  Once the fracture site was identified, it was dried of all hematoma as well as excess periosteum.  The fracture site was then displaced and the ankle joint was visualized including the dome of the talus.  There appeared to be some minor degenerative changes of the talus, but no loose bodies.  Next, the wound was copiously irrigated and suctioned dry.  The medial malleolus was placed in reduced position and held in place with a 1.25 mm K-wire.  Next, the 2.5 mm drill bed was then used to sequentially drill holes to full depth and 4.0 cancellous screws were placed in each, each with a 45 mm in length.  These appeared to hold the fracture site securely in an anatomic position.  Again, Xi-scan was brought in to confirm placement of the screws.  They were in good overall position and there was no lateralization of the joint.  At this time, each wound was copiously irrigated and suctioned dry.  The wounds were then closed using #2-0 Vicryl suture in subcutaneous fashion followed by staples on the skin.  A sterile dressing was applied consistent with Adaptic, 4x4s, Kerlix, and Webril.  A Robert-Jones style splint was then placed on the right lower extremity.  This was covered by a 4-inch Depuy dressing.  At this time, the Department of Anesthesia reversed the sedation.  The patient was transferred back to the hospital gurney and to the Postanesthetic Care Unit.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no complications.',\n",

She was started on Dostinex with increasing dosages.  The most recent MRI demonstrated an increased growth with hemorrhage.  This was then discontinued.  Most recent prolactin was at 70, although normalized, the recommendation was surgical resection given the size of the sellar lesion.  All the risks, benefits, and alternatives were explained in great detail via translator.,PREOP DIAGNOSIS: , Pituitary tumor.,POSTOP DIAGNOSIS: , Pituitary tumor.,PROCEDURE DETAIL:  ,The patient brought to the operating room, positioned on the horseshoe headrest in a neutral position supine.  The fluoroscope was then positioned.  The approach will be dictated by Dr. X. Once the operating microscope and the endoscope were then used to approach it through transnasal, this was complicated and complex secondary to the drilling within the sinus.  Once this was ensured, the tumor was identified, separated from the pituitary gland, it was isolated and then removed.  It appeared to be hemorrhagic and a necrotic pituitary, several sections were sent.  Once this was ensured and completed and hemostasis obtained, the wound was irrigated.  There might have been a small CSF leak with Valsalva, so the recommendation was for a reconstruction, Dr. X will dictate.  The fat graft was harvested from the left lower quadrant and closed primarily, this was soaked in fat and used to close the closure.  All sponge and needle counts were correct.  The patient was extubated and transported to the recovery room in stable condition.  Blood loss was minimal.',\n",

There was stenosis in the mid-venous limb of the graft.,INDICATIONS: , The patient is an 81-year-old African-American female who presents with an occluded left forearm loop graft.  She was not able to have her dialysis as routine.  Her potassium was dramatically elevated at 7 the initial evening of anticipated surgery.  Both Surgery and Anesthesia thought this would be too risky to do.  Thus, she was given medications to decrease her potassium and a temporary hemodialysis catheter was placed in the femoral vein noted for her to have dialysis that night as well as this morning.  This morning her predialysis potassium was 6, and thus she was scheduled for surgery after her dialysis.,PROCEDURE: , The patient was taken to the operative suite and prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  A transverse incision was made at the region of the venous anastomosis of the graft.  Further dissection was carried down to the catheter.  The vein appeared to be soft and without thrombus.  This outflow did not appear to be significantly impaired.  A transverse incision was made with a #11 blade on the venous limb of the graft near the anastomosis.  Next, a thrombectomy was done using a #4 Fogarty catheter.  Some of the clot and thrombus was removed from the venous limb.  The balloon did hang up in the multiple places along the venous limb signifying some degree of stenosis.  Once removing most of the clots from the venous limb prior to removing the plug, dilators were passed down the venous limb also indicating the area of stenosis.  At this point, we felt the patient would benefit from a curettage of the venous limb of the graft.  This was done and subsequent passes with the dilator and the balloon were then very easy and smooth following the curettage.  The Fogarty balloon was then passed beyond the clot and the plug.  The plug was visualized and inspected.  This also gave a good brisk bleeding from the graft.  The patient was heparinized and hep saline solution was injected into the venous limb and the angle vascular clamp was applied to the venous limb.  Attention was directed up to its anastomosis and the vein.  Fogarty balloon and thrombectomy was also performed well enough into this way.  There was good venous back bleeding following this.  The area was checked for any stenosis with the dilators and none was present.  Next, a #6-0 Prolene suture was used in a running fashion to close the graft.  Just prior to tying the suture, the graft was allowed to flush to move any debris or air.  The suture was also checked at that point for augmentation, which was good.  The suture was tied down and the wound was irrigated with antibiotic solution.  Next, a #3-0 Vicryl was used to approximate the subcutaneous tissues and a #4-0 undyed Vicryl was used in a running subcuticular fashion to approximate the skin edges.  Steri-Strips were applied and the patient was taken to recovery in stable condition.  She tolerated the procedure well.  She will be discharged from recovery when stable.

Although O2 had been placed, elevating his oxygen saturations to the mid to upper 90s, he continued to complain of symptoms, as noted above. He became progressively more rapidly obtunded. The patient did receive one gram of magnesium sulfate shortly after his arrival, and the BiPAP apparatus was being readied for his use. However, the patient, at this point, became unresponsive, unable to answer questions, and preparations were begun for intubation. The BiPAP apparatus was briefly placed while supplies and medications were assembled for intubation. It was noted that even with the BiPAP apparatus, in the duration of time which was required for transfer of oxygen tubing to the BiPAP mask, the patient’s O2 saturations rapidly dropped to the upper 60 range.,All preparations for intubation having been undertaken, Succinylcholine was ordered, but was apparently unavailable in the department. As the patient was quite obtunded, and while the Dacuronium was being sought, an initial trial of intubation was carried out using a straight blade and a cupped 7.9 endotracheal tube. However, the patient had enough residual muscle tension to make this impractical and further efforts were held pending administration of Dacuronium 10 mg. After approximately two minutes, another attempt at intubation was successful. The cords were noted to be covered with purulent exudates at the time of intubation.,The endotracheal tube, having been placed atraumatically, the patient was initially then nebulated on 100% oxygen, and his O2 saturations rapidly rose to the 90-100% range.,Chest x-ray demonstrated proper placement of the tube. The patient was given 1 mg of Versed, with decrease of his pulse from the 140-180 range to the 120 range, with satisfactory maintenance of his blood pressure.,Because of a complaint of chest pain, which I myself did not hear, during the patient’s initial triage elevation, a trial of Tridil was begun. As the patient’s pressures held in the slightly elevated range, it was possible to push this to 30 mcg per minute. However, after administration of the Dacuronium and Versed, the patient’s blood pressure fell somewhat, and this medication was discontinued when the systolic pressure briefly reached 98.,Because of concern regarding pneumonia or sepsis, the patient received one gram of Rocephin intravenously shortly after the intubation. A nasogastric and Foley were placed, and an arterial blood gas was drawn by respiratory therapy. Dr. X was contacted at this point regarding further orders as the patient was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit to be placed on the ventilator there. The doctor’s call was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit so he could leave appropriate orders for the patient in addition to my initial orders, which included Albuterol or Atrovent q. 2h. and Levaquin 500 mg IV, as well as Solu-Medrol.,Critical care note terminates at this time.,EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE:,  See the critical care note.,MEDICAL DECISION MAKING (DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS):,  This patient has an acute severe decompensation with respiratory failure.

The chest was prepped and draped in the routine fashion for insertion of a Port-A-Catheter.  The left subclavian vein was punctured with a single stick and a guidewire threaded through the needle into the superior vena cava under fluoroscopic guidance.  The needle was removed.  An incision was made over the guidewire for entrance of the dilator with sheath.  A second counter incision was made transversally on the chest wall about an inch and half below the puncture site with a #15 blade.  Hemostasis was effective to electrocautery, and a pocket was fashioned subcutaneously for positioning of the reservoir.  The Port-A-Catheter reservoir tubing was attached to the reservoir in the routine fashion.  The reservoir was placed in the pocket and sutured to the anterior chest wall muscle with three interrupted 4-0 Prolene sutures for stability.  Next, a catheter passer was passed from the pocket exiting through the skin at the puncture site, previously placed for the guidewire, and the Port-A-Catheter was pulled from the reservoir exiting on the skin.  It was placed on the chest, measured, and cut to the appropriate length.  This having been done, the dilator with sheath attached was passed over the guidewire into the superior vena cava under fluoroscopic guidance.  The guidewire and dilator were removed, and the Port-A-Catheter was threaded through the sheath into the superior vena cava, and the sheath removed under fluoroscopic guidance.  Fluoroscopy revealed the Port-A-Catheter to be in excellent position.  The Port-A-Catheter was accessed with a butterfly 90-degree needle percutaneously that drew blood well and flushed easily.  It was flushed with heparinized saline connected in cath.  This having been done, the puncture site was closed with a circumferential subcutaneous 3-0 Vicryl suture, and the skin was closed with a percutaneous circumferential subcuticular suture.  This having been done, attention was applied to the reservoir incision.

There is marrow edema within the posterolateral corner of the tibia, and there is linear signal adjacent to the cortex suggesting that there may be a Segond fracture for which correlation with radiographs is recommended (series #6, images #4-7).,Biceps femoris tendon and iliotibial band are intact and there is no discrete fibular collateral ligament tear. Normal quadriceps and patellar tendons.,There is contusion within the posterior non-weight bearing surface of the medial femoral condyle, as well as in the posteromedial corner of the tibia. There is linear vertically oriented signal within the distal tibial diaphyseal-metaphyseal junction (series #7, image #8; series #2, images #4-5). There is no discrete fracture line, and this is of uncertain significance, but this should be correlated with radiographs.,The patellofemoral joint is congruent without patellar tilt or subluxation. Normal medial and lateral patellar retinacula. There is a joint effusion.,IMPRESSION:,Changes within the lateral meniscus most likely reflect previous partial meniscectomy and re-contouring although a subtle undersurface tear in the anterior horn may be present.,Mild anterior cruciate ligament interstitial sprain.,There is a strain of the popliteus muscle and tendon and there is a sprain of the posterolateral and posterocentral joint capsule with a possible Second fracture which should be correlated with radiographs.,',\n",

       " \"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Bunion, right foot.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Bunion, right foot.,PROCEDURE PERFORMED:,  Austin/akin bunionectomy, right foot.,HISTORY: , This 77-year-old African-American female presents to ABCD General Hospital with the above chief complaint.  The patient states she has had a bunion deformity for as long as she can remember that has progressively become worse and more painful.  The patient has attempted conservative treatment without long-term relief of symptoms and desires surgical treatment.,PROCEDURE DETAILS:,  An IV was instituted by Department of Anesthesia in the preop holding area.  The patient was transported to the operating room and placed on the operating table in the supine position with a safety strap across her lap.  Copious amounts of Webril were placed around the right ankle followed by blood pressure cuff.  After adequate sedation by the Department of Anesthesia, a total of 15 cc of 1:1 mixture of 1% lidocaine plain and 0.5% Marcaine plain was injected in a Mayo block type fashion.  The foot was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile orthopedic fashion.  The foot was elevated to the operating table and exsanguinated with an Esmarch bandage.  The pneumatic ankle tourniquet was inflated to 250 mmHg.  The foot was lowered to the operating field and the stockinet was reflected.  The foot was cleansed with wet and dry sponge.,Attention was directed to the bunion deformity on the right foot.  An approximately 6 cm dorsal medial incision was created over the first metatarsophalangeal joint.  The incision was then deepened with a #15 blade.  All vessels encountered were ligated with hemostasis.  The skin and subcutaneous tissue were then undermined off of the capsule medially.  A dorsal linear capsular incision was then created over the first metatarsophalangeal joint.  The periosteum and capsule were then reflected off of the first metatarsal.  There was noted to be a prominent medial eminence.  The articular cartilage was healthy for patient's age and race.  Attention was then directed to the first interspace where a lateral release was performed..  A combination of sharp and blunt dissection was carried out until the adductor tendon insertions were identified.  The adductor tendons were transected as well as a lateral capsulotomy was performed.  The extensor digitorum brevis tendon was identified and transected.  Care was taken to preserve the extensor hallucis longus to make sure that tendon that was transected was the extensor hallucis brevis at the _______ digitorum.  Extensor hallucis brevis tendon was transected and care was taken to preserve the extensor halucis longus tendon.  Attention was then directed to medial eminence, which was resected with a sagittal saw.  Sagittal was then used to create a long dorsal arm outside the Austin type osteotomy and the first metatarsal.  The head of the first metatarsal was then translocated laterally until correction of the intermetatarsal angle was noted.  The head was intact.  A 0.45 K-wire was inserted through subcutaneously from proximal medial to distal lateral.  A second K-wire was then inserted from distal lateral to proximal plantar medial.  Adequate fixation was noted at the osteotomy site.  The K-wires were bent, cut, and pin caps were placed.  Attention was then directed to the proximal phalanx of the hallux.  The capsular periostem was reflected off of the base of the proximal phalanx.  A sagittal was then used to create an akin osteotomy closing wedge.  The apex was lateral and the base of the wedge was medial.  The wedge was removed in the total and the osteotomy site was then feathered until closure was achieved without compression.  Two 0.45 K-wires were then inserted, one from distal medial to proximal lateral and the second from distal lateral to proximal medial across the osteotomy site.  Adequate fixation was noted at the osteotomy site and the osteotomy was closed.  The toe was noted to be in a markedly more rectus position.  Sagittal saw was then used to resect the remaining prominent medial eminence.  The area was then smoothed with a reciprocating rasp.  There was noted to be a small osteophytic formation laterally over first metatarsal head that was removed with a rongeur and smoothed with a reciprocating rasp.  The area was then inspected for any remaining short bony edges, none were noted.,Copious amounts of sterile saline was then used to flush the surgical site.  The capsule was closed with #3-0 Vicryl.  Subcutaneous closure was performed with #4-0 Vicryl followed by running subcuticular #5-0 Vicryl.  Steri-Strips were applied and 1 cc of dexamethasone phosphate was injected into the surgical site.,Dressings consisted of #0-1 silk, copious Betadine, 4 x 4s, Kling, Kerlix, and Coban.  The pneumatic ankle tourniquet was released and immediate hyperemic flush was noted to all five digits of the right foot.  A _______ cast was then applied postoperatively.  The patient tolerated the above procedure and anesthesia well without complications.  The patient was transported from the operating room to the PACU with vital signs stable and vascular status intact to the right foot.  The patient was given postoperative pain prescription for Tylenol #3 and instructed to take one q4-6h. p.o. p.r.n. for pain.  The patient is to follow up with Dr. X in his office as directed.\",\n",

She had previously worked at the bank in Conway Springs in Norwich and had several other jobs related to accounting or management services.  She does have an MBA in business.  Currently, she works at T-Mobile Customer Service, and there is quite a bit of technical knowledge, deadlines, and stress related to that job as well.

       " \"DIAGNOSIS: , Status post brain tumor with removal.,SUBJECTIVE:  ,The patient is a 64-year-old female with previous medical history of breast cancer that has metastasized to her lung, liver, spleen, and brain, status post radiation therapy.  The patient stated that on 10/24/08 she had a brain tumor removed with subsequent left-sided weakness.  The patient was readmitted to ABC Hospital on 12/05/08 and was found to have massive swelling in the brain and a second surgery was performed to reduce the swelling.  The patient remained at the acute rehab at ABC until she was discharged home on 01/05/09.  The patient did receive skilled speech therapy while in the acute rehab, which focused on higher level cognitive and linguistic skills such as attention, memory, mental flexibility, and improvement of her executive function.  The patient also complains of difficulty with word retrieval and slurring of speech.  The patient denies any difficulty with swallowing at this time.,OBJECTIVE:  ,Portions of the cognitive linguistic quick test was administered.  An oral mechanism exam was performed.  A motor speech protocol was completed.,The cognitive linguistic subtests of recalling personal facts, symbol cancellation, confrontational naming, clock drawing, story retelling, generative naming, design and memory, and completion of mazes was administered.,The patient was 100% accurate with recalling personal facts, completion of the symbol cancellation tasks, and with confrontational naming.  She had no difficulty with the clock drawing task; however, she has considerable hand tremors, which makes writing difficult.  In the storytelling task, she scored within normal limits.  She was also within normal limits for generative naming.  She did have difficulty with the design, memory, and mazes subtests.  She was unable to complete the second maze during the allotted time.  The design generation subtest was also completed.  She was able to draw four unique designs, and toward the end of the tasks was no longer able to recall the stated direction.,ORAL MECHANISM EXAMINATION:,  The patient has mild left facial droop with decreased nasolabial fold.  Tongue is at midline, and lingual range of motion and strength are within functional limit.  The patient does complain of biting her tongue on occasion, but denied biting the inside of her cheeks.  Her AMRs are judged to be within functional limit.  Her rate of speech is decreased with a monotonous vocal quality.  The decreased rate may be a compensation for decreased word retrieval ability.  The patient's speech is judged to be 100% intelligible without background noise.,DIAGNOSTIC IMPRESSION:  ,The patient has mild cognitive linguistic deficits in the areas of higher level cognitive function seen in mental flexibility, memory, and executive function.,PLAN OF CARE:,  Outpatient skilled speech therapy two times a week for four weeks to include cognitive linguistic treatment.,SHORT-TERM GOALS (THREE WEEKS):,1.

The neck was prepped and draped in the usual fashion.  An incision was made from midline to the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid in the right side.  Skin and subcutaneous tissue were divided sharply.  Trachea and esophagus were retracted medially.  Carotid sheath was retracted laterally.  Longus colli muscles were dissected away from the vertebral bodies of C5-C6.  We confirmed our position by taking intraoperative x-rays.  We then used the operating microscope and cleaned out the disk completely.  We then sized the interspace and then tapped in a #7 mm cortical cancellous graft.  We then used the DePuy Dynamic plate with 14-mm screws.  Jackson-Pratt drain was placed in the prevertebral space and brought out through a separate incision.

The patient subsequently then had a CT scan which demonstrated a very large thyroid gland, especially on the left side with substernal extension down to the level of the aortic arch.  The patient was then immediately set up for surgery.  After risks, complications, consequences, and questions were addressed with the patient, a written consent was obtained.,PROCEDURE:,  The patient was brought to the operative suite by Anesthesia and placed on the operative table in the supine position.  The patient was then placed under general endotracheal intubation anesthesia and the patient then had a shoulder roll placed.  After this, the patient then had the area marked initially.  The preoperative setting was then localized with 1% lidocaine and epinephrine 1:100,000 approximately 10 cc total.  After this, the patient was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  A #15 Bard-Parker was then utilized to make a skin incision horizontally, approximately 5 cm on either side from midline.  After this, a blunt dissection was then utilized to dissect the subcutaneous fat from the platysmal muscle.  There appeared to be a natural dehiscence of the platysma in the midline.  A sub-platysmal dissection was then performed in the superior, inferior, and lateral directions with the help of a bear claw, Metzenbaum scissors and DeBakey forceps.  Any bleeding was controlled with monopolar cauterization.  After this, the two anterior large jugular veins were noted and resected laterally.  The patient's trachea appeared to be slightly deviated to the right with identification finally of the midline raphe, off midline to the right.  This was grasped on either side with a DeBakey forceps and dissected with monopolar cauterization and dissected with a Metzenbaum scissors.  After this was dissected, the sternohyoid muscles were resected laterally and separated from the sternothyroid muscles.  The sternothyroid muscles were then bluntly freed and dissected from the right thyroid gland.  After this, attention was then drawn to the left gland, where the sternothyroid muscle was dissected bluntly on this side utilizing finger dissection and Kitners.  The left thyroid gland was freed initially superiorly and worked inferiorly and laterally until the gland was pulled from the substernal region by blunt dissection and reflected and pulled anteriorly.  After this, the superior and inferior parathyroid glands were noted.  The dissection was carried very close to the thyroid gland to try to select these parathyroids posteriorly.  After this, the superior pole was then identified and the superior laryngeal artery and vein were cross clamped and tied with __________ undyed Vicryl tie.  The superior pole was finally freed and a small little feeding branched vessels from this area were cauterized with the bipolar cautery and cut with Metzenbaum scissors.  After this, the thyroid gland was further freed down to the level of the Berry's ligament inferiorly and the dissection was carried once again more superiorly.  The fine stats were then utilized to dissect along the superior aspect of the recurrent laryngeal nerve on the left side with freeing of the connective Berry's ligament tissue from the gland with the bipolar cauterization and the fine stat.  Finally, attention was then drawn back to the patient's right side where the gland was rotated more anteriorly with fine dissection utilizing a fine stat to reflect the superior and inferior parathyroid glands laterally and posteriorly.  The recurrent laryngeal nerve on this side was identified and further dissection was carried superiorly and anteriorly through this nerve to finally free the right side of the gland to Berry's ligament.  The middle thyroid vein and inferior thyroid arteries were cross clamped and tied with #2-0 undyed Vicryl ties and also bipolared with the bipolar cauterization bilaterally.  The Berry's ligament was then finally freed and the gland was then passed to scrub tech and passed off the field to Pathology.  The neck was then thoroughly irrigated with normal saline solution and further bleeding was controlled with bipolar cauterization.  After this, Surgicel was then placed in the bilateral neck regions and a #10 Jackson-Pratt drain was then placed within the left neck region with some extension over to the right neck region.  This was brought out through the inferior skin incision and secured to the skin with a #2-0 nylon suture.  The strap muscles were then reapproximated with a running #3-0 Vicryl suture followed by reapproximation of the platysma and subcutaneous tissue with a #4-0 undyed Vicryl.  The skin was then reapproximated with a #5-0 Prolene subcuticular along with a #6-0 fast over the top.  After this, Mastisol Steri-Strips and Bacitracin along with a sterile dressing and a __________ dressing were then placed.  The patient intraoperatively did have approximately 50 cc of bloody drainage from this area within the JP drain.  The patient was then turned back to Anesthesia, extubated in the operating room and transferred to Recovery in stable condition.

I am bringing her back to the operating room for another exploration of this area and washout.  This will be the third procedure for this.  At the last time, there was gross purulence that was encountered.  Since that time, the patient has defervesced.  Her white count is slowly coming down.  Her C-reactive protein is slowly coming down.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:,  After informed consent was obtained, operative site marked, and after preoperative antibiotics were given, the patient was brought back to the operating room and placed supine on the operating table, where Anesthesia induced general anesthesia.  The patient's right lower extremity was prepped and draped in normal sterile fashion.  Surgical timeout occurred verifying the patient's identification, surgical site, surgical procedure, and administration of antibiotics.  The patient's previous incision sites had the sutures removed.  We bluntly dissected down through to the IT band.  These deep stitches were then removed.  We exposed the area of the subperiosteal abscess.  The tissue looked much better than at the last surgery.  We irrigated this area with three liters of saline containing bacitracin.  Next, we made our small medial window to assist with washout of the joint itself.  We put another three liters of saline containing bacitracin through the knee joint.  Lastly, we did another three liters into the area of the distal femur with three liters of plain saline.  We then placed two Hemovac drains, one in the metaphysis and one superficially.  We closed the deep fascia with #1 PDS.  Subcutaneous layers with 2-0 Monocryl and closed the skin with 2-0 nylon.  We placed a sterile dressing.  We then turned the case over to Dr. Petty for dressing change and skin graft.,PLAN:  ,Our plan will be to pull the drains in 48 hours.  We will then continue to watch the patient's fever curve and follow her white count to see how she is responding to the operative and medical therapies.,\",\n",

Low flow perfusion 32 minutes.,FINDINGS:,  Horizontal pulmonary venous confluence with right upper and middle with two veins entering the confluence on the right and multiple entry sites for left-sided veins.  Large patulous anastomosis between posterior aspect of the left atrium and anterior aspect of the pulmonary venous confluence.  Nonobstructed ascending vein ligated.  Patent ductus arteriosus diminutive left atrium with posterior atrial septal defect with deficient inferior margin.  At completion of the procedure, right ventricular pressure approximating one-half of systemic, normal sinus rhythm, good biventricular function by visual inspection.,PROCEDURE: , After the informed consent, the patient was brought to the operating room and placed on the operating room table in supine position.  Upon induction of general endotracheal anesthesia and placement of indwelling arterial and venous monitoring lines.  The patient was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion from chin to groins.  A median sternotomy incision was performed.  Dissection was carried through the deeper planes until the sternum was scored and divided with an oscillating saw.  A subtotal thymectomy was performed.  Systemic heparinization was achieved and the pericardium was entered and fashioned until cradle.  A small portion of the anterior pericardium was procured and fixed in glutaraldehyde for patch closure of segment of the atrial septal defect during the procedure.  Pursestrings were deployed on the ascending aorta on the right.  Atrial appendage.  The aorta was then cannulated with an 8-French aorta cannula and the right atrium with an 18-French Polystan right-angle cannula.  With an ACT greater than 400, greater pulmonary bypass was commenced with excellent cardiac decompression and the patent ductus arteriosus was ligated with a 2-0 silk tie.  Systemic cooling was started and the head was packed  and iced and systemic steroids were administered.  During cooling, traction suture was placed in the apex of the left ventricle.  After 25 minutes of cooling, the aorta was cross-clamped and the heart arrested by administration of 30 cubic centimeter/kilogram of cold-blood cardioplegia delivered directly within the aortic root following the aorta cross-clamping.  Following successful cardioplegic arrest, a period of low flow perfusion was started and a 10-French catheter was inserted into the right atrial appendage substituting the 18-French Polystan venous cannula.  The heart was then rotated to the right side and the venous confluence was exposed.  It was incised and enlarged and a corresponding incision in the dorsal and posterior aspect of the left atrium was performed.  The two openings were then anastomosed in an end-to-side fashion with several interlocking sutures to avoid pursestring effect with a running 7-0 PDS suture.  Following completion of the anastomosis, the heart was returned into the chest and the patient's blood volume was drained into the reservoir.  A right atriotomy was then performed during the period of circulatory arrest.  The atrial septal defect was very difficult to expose, but it was sealed with an autologous pericardial patch was secured in place with a running 6-0 Prolene suture.  The usual deairing maneuvers were carried out and lining was administered and the right atriotomy was closed in two layers with a running 6-0 Prolene sutures.  The venous cannula was reinserted.  Cardiopulmonary bypass restarted and the aorta cross-clamp was released.  The patient returned to normal sinus rhythm spontaneously and started regaining satisfactory hemodynamics which, following a prolonged period of rewarming, allow for us to wean her from cardiopulmonary bypass successfully and moderate inotropic support and sinus rhythm.  Modified ultrafiltration was carried out and two sets of atrial and ventricular pacing wires were placed as well as the peritoneal dialysis catheter and two 15-French Blake drains.  Venous decannulation was followed by aortic decannulation and administration of protamine sulfate.  All cannulation sites were oversewn with 6-0 Prolene sutures and the anastomotic sites noticed to be hemostatic.  With good hemodynamics and hemostasis, the sternum was then smeared with vancomycin, placing closure with stainless steel wires.  The subcutaneous tissues were closed in layers with the reabsorbable monofilament sutures.  Sponge and needle counts were correct times 2 at the end of the procedure.  The patient was transferred in very stable condition to the pediatric intensive care unit .,I was the surgical attending present in the operating room and in charge of the surgical procedure throughout the entire length of the case.  Given the magnitude of the operation, the unavailability of an appropriate level, cardiac surgical resident, Mrs. X (attending pediatric cardiac surgery at the Hospital) participated during the cross-clamp time of the procedure in quality of first assistant.\",\n",

Once he was anesthetized, a caudal block was placed.  The patient was placed in supine position and examined.  The left testis well within scrotum.  The right was again not palpable despite the patient being asleep with multiple attempts to check.,The patient was then sterilely prepped and draped.  An 8-French feeding tube was then placed within his bladder through the urethra and attached to the drainage.  We then incised the infraumbilical area once he was sterilely prepped and draped, with 15 blade knife, then using Hasson technique with stay stitches in the anterior and posterior rectus fascia sheath of 3-0 Monocryl.  We entered the peritoneum with the 5-mm one-step system.  We then used the short 0-degree lens for laparoscopy.  We then insufflated with carbon dioxide insufflation to pressure of 12 mmHg.  There was no bleeding noted upon evaluation of the abdomen and again the findings were as mentioned with closed ring with vas and vessels going to the left and vessels and absent vas on the right where the closed ring was found.  Because there was no testis found in the abdomen, we then evacuated the gas and closed the fascial sheath with the 3-0 Monocryl tacking sutures.  Then skin was closed with subcutaneous closure of 4-0 Rapide.  A curvilinear upper scrotal incision was made on the right with 15 blade knife and carried down through the subcutaneous tissue with electrocautery.  Electrocautery was used for hemostasis.  A curved tenotomy scissor was used to open the sac.  The tunica vaginalis was visualized and grasped and then dissected up towards external ring.  There was no apparent testicular tissue.  We did remove it, however, tying off the cord structure with a 4-0 Vicryl suture and putting a tagging suture at the base of the tissue sent.  We then closed the subdartos area with the subcutaneous closure of 4-0 chromic.  We then did a similar curvilinear incision on the left side for testicular fixation.  Delivered the testis into the field, which had a type III epididymal attachment and was indeed about 3 to 4 mL in size, which was larger than expected for the patient's age.  We then closed the upper aspect of the subdartos pouch with the 4-0 chromic pursestring suture and placed testis back into the scrotum in the proper orientation and closed the dartos, skin, and subcutaneous closure with 4-0 chromic on left hemiscrotum.  At the end of the procedure, the patient received IV Toradol and had Dermabond tissue adhesive placed on both incisions and left testis was well descended in the scrotum at the end of the procedure.

The breasts were prepped and draped with DuraPrep and iodine solution and then draped in appropriate sterile fashion.  Markings were then made in the standing position preoperatively.  The nipple areolar complex was drawn at the level of the anterior projection of the inframammary fold along the central margin of the breast.  A McKissock ring was utilized as a pattern.  It was centered over the new nipple position and the medial and lateral flaps were drawn tangential to the pigmented areola at a 40-degree angle.  Medial and lateral flaps were drawn 8 cm in length.  At the most medial and lateral extremity inframammary folds, a line was drawn to the lower level at the medial and lateral flaps.  On the left side, the epithelialization was performed about the 45-mm nipple-areolar complex within the confines of the superior-medially based dermal parenchymal pedicle.  Resection of the skin, subcutaneous tissue, and glandular tissue was performed along the inframammary fold, and then cut was made medially and laterally.  The resection medially was perpendicular to the chest wall down to the areolar tissue overlying the pectoralis major muscle, and laterally, the resection was performed tangential to the chest wall, skin, subcutaneous tissue, and glandular tissue towards the axillary tail.  The pedicle was thinned as well, so it was 2-cm thick beneath the nipple-areolar complex and they were medially 4-cm thick at its base.  On the right side, 947 g of breast tissue was removed.  Hemostasis was achieved with electrocautery.  Identical procedure was performed on the opposite left side, again with a superiorly and inferiorly based dermal parenchymal pedicle with deepithelialization about the 45-mm diameter nipple-areolar complex.  Resection of the skin, subcutaneous tissue, and glandular tissue was performed medially down to the chest overlying the pectoralis major muscle and laterally tangential to the chest wall towards the axillary tail setting the pedicle as well beneath the nipple areolar complex.  Hemostasis was achieved with electrocautery.  With pedicle on the left, the breast issue on the left side was weighed at 758 g.  Hemostasis was achieved with cautery.  The patient was placed in the sitting position with wound partially closed and there appeared to be excellent symmetry between the right and left sides.  The nipple-areolar complex was transposed within the position and the medial and lateral flaps were brought together beneath the transposed nipple-areolar complex.  Closure was performed with interrupted 3-0 PDS suture for deep subcutaneous tissue and dermis.  Skin was closed with running subcuticular 4-0 Monocryl suture.  A Jackson-Pratt drain had been placed prior to final closure and secured with a 4-0 silk suture.  The wound had been irrigated prior to final closure as well with bacitracin irrigation solution prior to final cauterization.  Closure was performed with an anchor-shaped closure around the nipple-areolar complex, vertically of inframammary folds and across the inframammary folds.  Dressing was applied.  The suture line was treated with Dermabond.  The patient returned to the recovery room with 2 Jackson-Pratt drains, 1 on each side and IV Foley catheter with instructions to be seen in my office in 2 days.

She was begun on Aricept but could not tolerate that because of strange thoughts and hallucinations.  She was found to be hypercalcemic.  Intact PTH was mildly elevated.  A sestamibi parathyroid scan and an ultrasound showed evidence of a right superior parathyroid adenoma.,FINDINGS AND PROCEDURE:,  The patient was placed on the operating table in the supine position.  A time out was taken so that the anesthesia personnel, nursing personnel, surgical team, and patient could confirm the patient\\'s identity, operative site and operative plan.  The electronic medical record was reviewed as was the ultrasound.  The patient was sedated.  A small roll was placed behind the shoulders to moderately hyperextend the neck.  The head was supported in a foam head cradle.  The neck and chest were prepped with chlorhexidine and isolated with sterile drapes.  After infiltration with 1% Xylocaine with epinephrine along the planned incision, a transverse incision was made in the skin crease a couple of centimeters above the clavicular heads and carried down through the skin, subcutaneous tissue, and platysma.  The larger anterior neck veins were divided between 4-0 silk ligatures.  Superior and inferior flaps were developed in the subplatysmal plane using electrocautery and blunt dissection.  The sternohyoid muscles were separated in the midline, and the right sternohyoid muscle was retracted laterally.  The right sternothyroid muscle was divided transversely with the cautery.  The right middle thyroid vein was divided between 4-0 silk ligatures.  The right thyroid lobe was rotated leftward.  Posterior to the mid portion of the left thyroid lobe, a right superior parathyroid adenoma of moderate size was identified.  This was freed up and its pedicle was ligated with small Hemoclips and divided and the gland was removed.  It was sent for weight and frozen section.  It weighed 960 mg and on frozen section was consistent with a parathyroid adenoma.,Prior to the procedure, a peripheral blood sample had been obtained and placed in a purple top tube labeled \"pre-excision.\"  It was our intention to monitor intraoperative intact parathyroid hormone 10 minutes after removal of this parathyroid adenoma.  However, we could not obtain 3 cc of blood from either the left foot or the left arm after multiple attempts, and therefore, we decided that the chance of cure of hyperparathyroidism by removal of this parathyroid adenoma was high enough and the improvement in that chance of cure marginal enough that we would terminate the procedure without monitoring PTH.  The neck was irrigated with saline and hemostasis found to be satisfactory.  The sternohyoid muscles were reapproximated with interrupted 4-0 Vicryl.  The platysma was closed with interrupted 4-0 Vicryl, and the skin was closed with subcuticular 5-0 Monocryl and Dermabond.  The patient was awakened and taken to the recovery area in satisfactory condition having tolerated the procedure well.',\n",

The right foot was prepared and draped in usual sterile manner.  Anesthesia was achieved utilizing a 50:50 mixture of 2% lidocaine plain with 0.5 Marcaine plain infiltrated just proximal to the first metatarsocuneiform joint.  Hemostasis was achieved utilizing a pneumatic ankle Tourniquet placed above the right ankle and inflated to a pressure of 225 mmHg.  At this time, attention was directed to the dorsal aspect of the right first metatarsophalangeal joint where dorsal linear incision approximately 3 cm in length was made.  The incision was deepened within the same plain taking care of the Bovie and retracted all superficial nerves and vessels as necessary.  The incision was then carried down to the underlying capsular structure once again taking care of the Bovie and retracted all superficial nerves and vessels as necessary.  The capsular incision following the same outline as the skin incision was made and carried down to the underlying bony structure.  The capsule was then freed from the underling bony structure utilizing sharp and blunt dissection.  Using a microsagittal saw, the medial and dorsal very prominent bony eminence were removed and the area was inspected for any remaining bony prominences following resection of bone and those noted were removed using a hand rasp.  At this time, attention was directed to the first inner space using sharp and blunt dissection.  Dissection was carried down to the underling level of the adductor hallucis tendon, which was isolated and freed from its phalangeal, sesamoidal, and metatarsal attachments.  The tendon was noted to lap the length and integrity for transfer and at this time was tenotomized taking out resection of approximately 0.5 cm to help prevent any re-fibrous attachment.  At this time, the lateral release was stressed and was found to be complete.  The extensor hallucis brevis tendon was then isolated using blunt dissection and was tenotomized as well taking out approximately 0.5-cm resection.  The entire area was copiously flushed 3 times using a sterile saline solution and was inspected for any bony prominences remaining and it was noted that the base of the proximal phalanx on the medial side due to the removal of the extensive buildup of the metatarsal head was going to be very prominent in nature and at this time was removed using a microsagittal saw.  The area was again copiously flushed and inspected for any abnormalities and/or prominences and none were noted.  At this time, attention was directed to the base of the first metatarsal where a second incision was made approximately 4 cm in length.  The incision was deepened within the same plain taking care of Bovie and retracted all superficial nerves and vessels as necessary.  The incision was then carried down to the level of the metatarsal and using sharp and blunt dissection periosteal capsule structures were freed from the base of the metatarsal and taking care to retract the long extensive tendon and any neurovascular structures to avoid any disruption.  At this time, there was a measurement made of 1 cm just distal to the metatarsocuneiform joint on the medial side and 2 cm distal to the metatarsocuneiform joint from the lateral aspect of the joint.  At this time, 0.5 cm was measured distal to that lateral measurement and using microsagittal saw, a wedge osteotomy was taken from the base with the apex of the osteotomy being medial, taking care to keep the medial cortex intact as a hinge.  The osteotomy site was feathered down until the osteotomy site could be closed with little tension on it and at this time using an OrthoPro screw 3.0 x 22 mm.  The screw was placed following proper technique.  The osteotomy site was found to be fixated with absolutely no movement and good stability upon manual testing.  A very tiny gap on the lateral aspect of the osteotomy site was found and this was filled in packing it with the cancellous bone that was left over from the wedge osteotomy.  The packing of the cancellous bone was held in place with bone wax.  The entire area was copiously flushed 3 times using a sterile saline solution and was inspected and tested again for any movement of the osteotomy site or any gapping and then removed.  At this time, a deep closure was achieved utilizing #2-0 Vicryl suture, subcuticular closure was achieved using #4-0 Vicryl suture, and skin repair was achieved at both surgical sites with #5-0 nylon suture in a running interlocking fashion.  The hallux was found to have excellent movement upon completion of the osteotomy and the second procedure of the McBride bunionectomy and the metatarsal was found to stay in excellent alignment with good stability at the proximal osteotomy site.  At this time, the surgical site was postoperatively injected with 0.5 Marcaine plain as well as dexamethasone 4 mg primarily.  The surgical sites were then dressed with sterile Xeroform, sterile 4x4s, cascading, and Kling with a final protective layer of fiberglass in a nonweightbearing cast fashion.

Right breast was slightly larger than the left this was repaired with a basic wise pattern reduction mammoplasty with anterior pedicle.,PROCEDURE,With the patient under satisfactory general endotracheal anesthesia, the entire chest was prepped and draped in usual sterile fashion.  A previously placed mark to identify the neo-nipple site was re-identified and carefully measured for asymmetry and appeared to be satisfactory.  A keyhole wire ring was then used to outline the basic wise pattern with 6-cm lamps inferiorly.  This was then carefully checked for symmetry and appeared to be satisfactory.  All marks were then completed and lightly incised on both breasts.  The right breast was approached first.  The neo-nipple site was de-epithelialized superiorly and then the inferior pedicle was de-epithelialized using cutting cautery.  After this had been completed, cutting cautery was used to carry down an incision along the inferior aspect of the periosteum starting immediately.  This was taken down to the prepectoral fashion dissected for short distance superiorly, and then blunt dissection was used to mobilize under the superior portion of the breast tissues to the lateral edge of the pectoral muscle.  There was very little bleeding with this procedure.  After this had been completed, attention was directed to the lateral side, and the inferior incision was made and taken down to the serratus.  Cautery dissection was then used to carry this up superiorly over the lateral edge of the pectoral muscle to communicate with the previous pocket.  After this had been completed, cutting cautery was used to cut around the inferior pedicle completely freeing the superior breast from the inferior breast.  Hemostasis was obtained with electrocautery.  After this had been completed, cutting cautery was used to cut along the superior edge of the redundant tissue and this was tapered under the superior flaps.

This site had been previously marked carefully, and there were no unusual findings and the superior tissue was then sent out separately for pathology.  After this had been completed, final hemostasis obtained, and the wound was irrigated and a tagging suture placed to approximate the tissues.  The breast cleared and the nipple appeared good.,Attention was then directed to the left breast, which was completed in the similar manner.  After this had been completed, the patient was placed in a near upright position, and symmetry appeared good, but it was a bit poor on the lateral aspect of the right side, which was little larger and some suction lipectomy was carried out in this area.  After completion of this, 1860 grams had been removed from the right and 1505 grams was removed from the left.  Through separate stab wounds on the lateral aspect, 10-mm flat Blake drains were brought out and sutures were then placed **** and irrigated.  The wounds were then closed with interrupted 4-0 Monocryl on the deep dermis and running intradermal 4-0 Monocryl on the skin, packing sutures and staples were removed as they were approached.  The nipple was sutured with running intradermal 4-0 Monocryl.  Vascularity appeared good throughout.  After this had been completed, all wounds were cleaned and Steri-Stripped.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  All counts were correct.  Estimated blood loss was less than 150 mL, and she was sent to recovery room in good condition.',\n",

The patient has been diagnosed with fibromyalgia and subsequently, has been treated with pain medications, anti-inflammatories and muscle relaxants.  The patient's symptoms continued to persist and subsequently, an MRI of the C-spine was done, which showed disc desiccation, spondylosis and herniated disk at C5-C6, an EMG and CV revealed a presence of mild-to-moderate carpal tunnel syndrome.  The patient is now being recommended to undergo decompression and spinal instrumentation and fusion at C5-C6.  The patient understood the risks and benefits of the surgery.  Risks include but not exclusive of bleeding and infection.  Bleeding can be in the form of soft tissue bleeding, which may compromise airway for which she can be brought emergently back to the operating room for emergent evacuation of the hematoma as this may cause weakness of all four extremities, numbness of all four extremities, as well as impairment of bowel and bladder function.  This could also result in dural tear with its attendant symptoms of headache, nausea, vomiting, photophobia, and posterior neck pain as well as the development of pseudomeningocele.  Should the symptoms be severe or the pseudomeningocele be large, she can be brought back to the operating room for repair of the CSF leak and evacuation of the pseudomeningocele.  There is also the risk of pseudoarthrosis and nonfusion, for which she may require redo surgery at this level.  There is also the possibility of nonimprovement of her symptoms in about 10% of cases.  The patient understands this risk on top of the potential injury to the esophagus and trachea as well as the carotid artery.  There is also the risk of stroke, should an undiagnosed plaque be propelled into the right cerebral circulation.  The patient also understands that there could be hoarseness of the voice secondary to injury to the recurrent laryngeal nerve.  She understood these risks on top of the risks of anesthesia and gave her consent for the procedure.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was brought to the operating room, awake, alert and not in any form of distress.  After smooth induction and intubation, the patient was positioned supine on the operating table with the neck placed on hyperextension and the head supported on a foam doughnut.  A marker was placed.  This verified the level to be at the C5-C6 level and incision was then marked in a transverse fashion starting from the midline extending about 5 mm beyond the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle.  The area was then prepped with DuraPrep after the head was turned 45 degrees to the left.,After sterile drapes were laid out, an incision was made using a scalpel blade #10.  Wound edge bleeders were carefully controlled with bipolar coagulation and the platysma was cut using a hot knife in a transverse fashion.  Dissection was then carried underneath the platysma superiorly inferiorly.  The anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid was identified and dissection was carried out lateral to the esophagus to trachea as well as medial to the carotid sheath in the sternocleidomastoid muscle.  The prevertebral fascia was noted to be taken her case with a lot of fat deposition.  Bipolar coagulation of bleeders was done; however, branch of the superior thyroid artery was ligated with Hemoclips x4.  After this was completed, a localizing x-ray verified the marker to be at the C6-C7 level.  We proceeded to strip the longus colli muscles off the vertebral body of the C5 and C6.  Self-retaining retractor was then laid down.  An anterior osteophyte was carefully drilled using a Midas 5-mm bur and the disk together with the inferior endplate of C5 and the superior endplate of C6 was also drilled down with the Midas 5-mm bur.  This was later followed with a 3-mm bur and the disk together with posterior longitudinal ligament was removed using Kerrison's ranging from 1 to 4 mm.  The herniation was noted on the right.  However, there was significant neuroforaminal stenosis on the left.  Decompression on both sides was done and after this was completed, a Valsalva maneuver showed no evidence of any CSF leakage.  The area was then irrigated with saline with bacitracin solution.  A 7 mm implant with its inferior packed with Vitoss was then laid down and secured in place with four 14 x 4.0 mm screws and plate 18 mm, all of which were titanium.  X-ray after this placement showed excellent position of all these implants and screws and _____ and the patient's area was also irrigated with saline with bacitracin solution.  A round French 10 JP drain was then laid down and exteriorized through a separate stab incision on the patient's right inferiorly.  The catheter was then anchored to the skin with a nylon 3-0 stitch and connected to a sterile draining system.  The wound was then closed in layers with Vicryl 3-0 inverted interrupted sutures for the platysma, Vicryl subcuticular 4-0 Stitch for the dermis, and the wound was reinforced with Dermabond.  Dressing was placed only at the exit site of the catheter.  C-collar was placed.  The patient was extubated and transferred to recovery.\",\n",

The right upper extremity was then prepped and draped in the usual manner.  A sterile tourniquet was placed on the proximal aspect of the right upper extremity.  The extremity was then elevated and exsanguinated with an Esmarch bandage and tourniquet was inflated to 250 mmHg.  Tourniquet time was 74 minutes.  A curvilinear incision was made in the antecubital fossa of the right elbow down through the skin.  Hemostasis was achieved utilizing electrocautery.  Subcutaneous fat was separated and the skin flaps elevated.  The _________ was identified.  It was incised.  The finger was placed approximately up the anterior aspect of the arm and the distal aspect of the biceps tendon was found.  There was some serosanguineous fluid from the previous rupture.  This area was suctioned clean.  The biceps tendon ends were then placed over a sterile tongue blade and were then sharply cut approximately 5 mm to 7 mm from the tip to create a fresh surface.  At this point, the #2 fiber wire was then passed through the tendon.  Two fiber wires were utilized in a Krackow-type suture.  Once this was completed, dissection was taken digitally down into the antecubital fossa in the path where the biceps tendon had been previously.  The radial tuberosity was palpated.  Just ulnar to this, a curved hemostat was passed through the soft tissues and was used to tent the skin on the radial aspect of the elbow.  A skin incision was made over this area.  Approximately two inches down to the skin and subcutaneous tissues, the fascia was split and the extensor muscle was also split.,A stat was then attached through the tip of that stat and passed back up through the antecubital fossa.  The tails of the fiber wire suture were grasped and pulled down through the second incision.  At this point, they were placed to the side.  Attention was directed at exposure of the radial tuberosity with a forearm fully pronated.  The tuberosity came into view.  The margins were cleared with periosteal elevator and sharp dissection.  Utilizing the power bur, a trough approximately 1.5 cm wide x 7 mm to 8 mm high was placed in the radial tuberosity.  Three small drill holes were then placed along the margin for passage of the suture.  The area was then copiously irrigated with gentamicin solution.  A #4-0 pullout wire was utilized to pass the sutures through the drill holes, one on each outer hole and two in the center hole.  The elbow was flexed and the tendon was then pulled into the trough with the forearm supinated.  The suture was tied over the bone islands.  Both wounds were then copiously irrigated with gentamicin solution and suctioned dry.  Muscle fascia was closed with running #2-0 Vicryl suture on the lateral incision followed by closure of the skin with interrupted #2-0 Vicryl and small staples.

The patient's uterus is intact, bladder is intact.,HISTORY: , The patient is an approximately 25-year-old Caucasian female with gravida-4, para-1-0-2-1.  The patient's last menstrual period was in December of 2002 with a foreseeable due date on 09/16/03 confirmed by ultrasound.,The patient has a history of herpes simplex virus to which there is no active prodromal and no evidence of lesions.  The patient has a history of IVDA and contracted hepatitis C with slightly elevated liver transaminases.  The patient had been seen through our office for prenatal care.  The patient is on Valtrex.  The patient was found to be 3 cm about 40%, 0 to 9 engaged.  Bag of waters was ruptured.  She was on Pitocin.  She was contracting appropriately for a couple of hours or so with appropriate ________.  There was no cervical change noted.  Most probably because there was a sink vertex and that the head was too large to descend into the pelvis.  The patient was advised of this and we recommended cesarean section.  She agreed.  We discussed the surgery, foreseeable risks and complications, alternative treatment, the procedure itself, and recovery in layman's terms.  The patient's questions were answered.  I personally made sure that she understood every aspect of the consent and that she was comfortable with the understanding of what would transpire.,PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was then taken back to operative suite.  She was given anesthetic and sterilely prepped and draped.  Pfannenstiel incision was used.  A second knife was used to carry the incision down to the anterior rectus fascia.  Anterior rectus fascia was incised in the midline and carried bilaterally and the fascia was lifted off the underlying musculature.  The rectus muscles were separated.  The patient's peritoneum tented up towards the umbilicus and we entered the abdominal cavity.  There was a very thin lower uterine segment.  There seemed to be quite a large baby.  The patient had a small nick in the uterus.  Following the blunt end of the bladder knife going through the innermost layer of the myometrium and into the endometrial cavity, clear amniotic fluid was obtained.  A blunt low transverse cervical incision was made.  Following this, we placed a ________ on the very large fetal head.  The head was delivered following which we were able to deliver a large baby girl, 9 lb, good at tone and cry.  The patient then underwent removal of the placenta after the cord blood and ABG were taken.  The patient's uterus was examined.  There appeared to be no retained products.  The patient's uterine incision was reapproximated and sutured with #0 Vicryl in a running non-interlocking fashion, the second imbricating over the first.  The patient's uterus was hemostatic.  Bladder flap was reapproximated with #0 Vicryl.  The patient then underwent an irrigation at every level of closure and the patient was quite hemostatic.  We reapproximated the rectus musculature with care being taken not to incorporate any underlying structures.  The patient had three interrupted sutures of this.  The fascia was reapproximated with two stitches of #0 Vicryl going from each apex towards the midline.  The Scarpa's fascia was reapproximated with #0 gut.  There was noted no fascial defects and the skin was closed with #0 Vicryl.,Prior to closing the abdominal cavity, the uterus appeared to be intact and bladder appeared to have clear urine and appeared to be intact.  The patient was hemostatic.  All counts were correct and the patient tolerated the procedure well.  We will see her back in recovery.\",\n",

The right frontal area was shaven and then the head was prepped and draped in a standard routine manner.  The area of the proposed scalp incision was infiltrated with 0.25% Marcaine with 1:200,000 epinephrine.  A curvilinear scalp incision was made extending from just posterior to bregma curving up in the midline and then going off to the right anterior to the coronal suture.  Two Weitlaner were used to hold the scalp open.  A burr hole was made just anterior to the coronal suture and then the dura was opened in a cruciate manner and the pia was coagulated.  Neuropen was introduced directly through the parenchyma into the ventricular system, which was quite large and dilated.  CSF was collected for routine studies.  We saw the total absence of __________  consistent with the congenital form of aqueductal stenosis and a markedly thinned down floor of the third ventricle.  I could bend the ventricular catheter and look back and see the aqueduct, which was quite stenotic with a little bit of chorioplexus near its opening.  The NeuroPEN was then introduced through the midline of the floor of the third ventricle anterior to the mamillary bodies in front of the basilar artery and then was gently enlarged using NeuroPEN __________  various motions.  We went through the membrane of Liliequist.  We could see the basilar artery and the clivus, and there was no significant bleeding from the edges.  The Bactiseal catheter was then left to 7 cm of length because of her macrocephaly and secured to a burr hole port with a 2-0 Ethibond suture.  The wound was irrigated out with bacitracin and closed using 3-0 Vicryl for the deep layer and a Monocryl suture for the scalp followed by Mastisol and Steri-Strips.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.',\n",

The FDS had a partial ulnar slip laceration and the FDP had a 25% transverse laceration as well.  The radial neurovascular bundle was found to be completely intact.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was taken to the operating room and placed in the supine position.  All bony prominences were adequately padded.  Tourniquet was placed on the right upper extremity after being packed with Webril, but not inflated at this time.  The right upper extremity was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  The hand was inspected.  Palmar surface revealed approximally 0.5 cm laceration at the base of the right ring finger at the base of proximal phalanx, which was approximated with nylon suture.  The sutures were removed and the wound was explored.  It was found that the ulnar digital neurovascular bundle was 100% transected.  The radial neurovascular bundle on the right ring finger was found to be completely intact.  We explored the flexor tendon and found that there was a partial laceration of the ulnar slip of the FDS and a 25% laceration in a transverse fashion to the FDP.  We copiously irrigated the wound.  Repair was undertaken of the FDS with #3-0 undyed Ethibond suture.  The laceration of the FDP was not felt that it need to repair due to majority of the substance in the FDP was still intact.  Attention during our repair at the flexor tendon, the A1 pulley was incised for better visualization as well as better tendon excursion after repair.  Attention was then drawn to the ulnar digital bundle which has been transected prior during the injury.  The digital nerve was dissected proximally and distally to likely visualize the nerve.  The nerve was then approximated using microvascular technique with #8-0 nylon suture.  The hands were well approximated.  The nerve was not under undue tension.  The wound was then copiously irrigated and the skin was closed with #4-0 nylon interrupted horizontal mattress alternating with simple suture.  Sterile dressing was placed and a dorsal extension Box splint was placed.  The patient was transferred off of the bed and placed back on a gurney and taken to PACU in stable condition.

The patient was positioned in the modified beachchair position utilizing the Mayfield headrest.  The left shoulder was propped posteriorly with a rolled towel.  His head was secured to the Mayfield headrest.  The left shoulder and upper extremity were then prepped and draped in the usual manner.  A posterior lateral port was made for _____ the arthroscopic cannula.  The scope was introduced into the glenohumeral joint.  There was noted to be a complete tear of the anterior glenoid labrum off from superiorly at about 11:30 extending down inferiorly to about 6 o'clock.  The labrum was adherent to the underlying capsule.  The margin of the glenoid was frayed in this area.  The biceps tendon was noted to be intact.  The articular surface of the glenoid was fairly well preserved.  The articular surface on the humeral head was intact; however, there was a large Hill-Sachs lesion on the posterolateral aspect of the humeral head.  The rotator cuff was visualized and noted to be intact.  The axillary pouch was visualized and it was free of injury.  There were some cartilaginous fragments within the axillary pouch.  Attention was first directed after making an anterior portal to fixation of the anterior glenoid labrum.  Utilizing the Chirotech system through the anterior cannula, the labrum was secured with the pin and drill component and was then tacked back to the superior glenoid rim at about the 11 o'clock position.  A second tack was then placed at about the 8 o'clock position.  The labrum was then probed and was noted to be stable.  With some general ranging of the shoulder, the tissue was pulled out from the tacks.  An attempt was made at placement of two other tacks; however, the tissue was not of good quality to be held in position.  Therefore, all tacks were either buried down to a flat surface or were removed from the anterior glenoid area.  At this point, it was deemed that an open Bankart arthroplasty was necessary.  The arthroscopic instruments were removed.  An anterior incision was made extending from just lateral of the coracoid down toward the axillary fold.  The skin incision was taken down through the skin.  Subcutaneous tissues were then separated with the coag Bovie to provide hemostasis.  The deltopectoral fascia was identified.  It was split at the deltopectoral interval and the deltoid was reflected laterally.  The subdeltoid bursa was then removed with rongeurs.  The conjoint tendon was identified.  The deltoid and conjoint tendons were then retracted with a self-retaining retractor.  The subscapularis tendon was identified.  It was separated about a centimeter from its insertion, leaving the tissue to do sew later.  The subscapularis was reflected off superiorly and inferiorly and the muscle retracted medially.  This allowed for visualization of the capsule.  The capsule was split near the humeral head insertion leaving a tag for repair.  It was then split longitudinally towards the glenoid at approximately 9 o'clock position.  This provided visualization of the glenohumeral joint.  The friable labral and capsular tissue was identified.  The glenoid neck was already prepared for suturing, therefore, three Mitek suture anchors were then positioned to place at approximately 7 o'clock, 9 o'clock, and 10 o'clock.  The sutures were passed through the labral capsular tissue and tied securely.  At this point, the anterior glenoid rim had been recreated.  The joint was then copiously irrigated with gentamicin solution and suctioned dry.  The capsule was then repaired with interrupted #1 Vicryl suture and repaired back to its insertion site with #1 Vicryl suture.  This later was then copiously irrigated with gentamicin solution and suctioned dry.  Subscapularis was reapproximated on to the lesser tuberosity of the humerus utilizing interrupted #1 Vicryl suture.  This later was then copiously irrigated as well and suctioned dry.  The deltoid fascia was approximated with running #2-0 Vicryl suture.  Subcutaneous tissues were approximated with interrupted #2-0 Vicryl and the skin was approximated with a running #4-0 subcuticular Vicryl followed by placement of Steri-Strips.  0.25% Marcaine was placed in the subcutaneous area for postoperative analgesia.  The patient was then placed in a shoulder immobilizer after a bulky dressing had been applied.  The patient was then transferred to the recovery room in apparent satisfactory condition.\",\n",

Risks such as bleeding, infection, damage to blood vessels, damage to nerve roots, need for further surgeries, chronic pain with range of motion, risk of continued discomfort, risk of need for further reconstructive procedures, risk of need for total knee revision, risk of blood clots, pulmonary embolism, myocardial infarction, and risk of death were discussed.  He understood them well.  All questions were answered and he signed consent for the procedure as described.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: , The patient was placed on operating table and general anesthesia was achieved.  The left lower extremity was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.  The leg was elevated and the tourniquet was inflated to 325 mmHg.  A longitudinal incision was then made and carried down through subcutaneous tissues.  This was made through the prior incision site.  There were some fatty necrotic tissues through the incision region and all necrotic tissue was debrided sharply on both sides of the incision site.  Medial and lateral flaps were then made.  The prior suture was identified, the suture removed and then a medial parapatellar arthrotomy was then performed.  Effusion within the knee was noted.  All hematoma was evacuated.  I then did flex the knee and removed the polyethylene.  Once the polyethylene was removed I did irrigate the knee with total of 9 liters of antibiotic solution.  Further debridement was performed of all inflamed tissue and thickened synovial tissue.  A 6 x 16-mm Stryker polyethylene was then snapped back in position.  The knee has excellent stability in all planes and I did perform a light manipulation to improve the flexion of the knee.  Further irrigation was performed on the all soft tissue in the knee with additional 3 liters of normal saline.  The knee was placed in a flexed position and the extensor mechanism was reapproximated using #2 Ethibond suture in a figure-of-eight manner.  The subcutaneous tissue was reapproximated in layers using #1 and 2-0 Vicryl sutures, and the skin was reapproximated using staples.  Prior to closure a Hemovac drain was inserted through a superolateral approach into the knee joint.,No complications were encountered throughout the procedure, and the patient tolerated the procedure well.  The patient was taken to recovery room in stable condition.',\n",

The lesser trochanter was intact.  The fracture site was noted to show abnormal pathological tissue with grayish discoloration.  The quality of the bone was also pathologically abnormal with soft trabecular bone.  The abnormal pathological tissues were sent along with the femoral head to pathology for assessment.  Articular cartilage of the acetabulum was intact and well preserved.,INDICATION: , The patient is a 53-year-old female with a history of malignant melanoma, who apparently had severe pain in her left lower extremity and was noted to have a basicervical femoral neck fracture.  She denied any history of fall or trauma.  The presentation was consistent with pathological fracture pending tissue assessment.  Indication, risks, and benefits were discussed.  Treatment options were reviewed.  No guarantees have been made or implied.,PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was brought to the operating room and once an adequate general anesthesia was achieved, she was positioned on a pegboard with the left side up.  The left lower extremity was prepped and draped in a standard sterile fashion.  Time-out procedure was called.  Antibiotics were infused.,A standard posterolateral approach was made.  Subcutaneous dissection was performed and the dissection was carried down to expose the fascia of the gluteus maximus.  This was then incised along the line of the incision.  Hemostasis was achieved.  Charnley retractor was positioned.  The trochanter was intact.  The gluteus medius was well protected with retractor.  The piriformis and minimus junction was identified.  The minimus was also reflected along with the medius.  Using Bovie and knife, the piriformis and external rotators were detached from its trochanteric insertion.  Similarly, L-shaped capsulotomy was performed.  A #5 Ethibond was utilized to tag the piriformis and the capsule for late repair.  Fracture site was exposed.  The femoral neck fracture was noted to be very low-lying basicervical type.  Femoral head was retrieved without any difficulty with the help of a corkscrew.  The head size was measured to be 43 mm.  Bony fragments were removed.  The acetabular socket was thoroughly irrigated.  A 43-mm bipolar trial head was inserted and this was noted to give a satisfactory fit with good stability.  The specimens submitted to pathology included the resected femoral head and the tissue at the fracture site, which was abnormal with grayish discoloration.  This was sent to the pathology.  The fracture was noted to be basicervical and preoperatively, decision was made to consider cemented calcar stem.  An L-shaped osteotomy was performed in order to accept the calcar prosthesis.  The basicervical fracture was noted to be just at the level of superior border of the lesser trochanter.  There was no calcar superior to the lesser trochanter.  The L-shaped osteotomy was performed to refine the bony edges and accept the calcar prosthesis.  Hemostasis was achieved.  Now, the medullary canal was entered with a canal finder.  The fracture site was well exposed.  Satisfactory lateralization was performed.  Attention was for the reaming process.  Using a size 1 reamer, the medullary canal was entered and reamed up to size 3, which gave us a satisfactory fit into the canal.  At this point, a trial prosthesis size 3 with 45 mm calcar body was inserted.  Appropriate anteversion was positioned.  The anteversion was marked with a Bovie to identify subsequent anteversion during implantation.  The bony edges were trimmed.  The calcar implant with 45 mm neck length was fit in the host femur very well.  There was no evidence of any subsidence.  At this point, trial reduction was performed using a bipolar trial head with 0 neck length.  The relationship between the central femoral head and the greater trochanter was satisfactory.  The hip was well reduced without any difficulty.  The stability and range of motion in extension and external rotation as well as flexion-adduction, internal rotation was satisfactory.  The shuck was less than 1 mm.  Leg length was satisfactory in reference to the contralateral leg.  Stability was satisfactory at 90 degrees of flexion and hip at 75-80 degrees of internal rotation.  Similarly, keeping the leg completely adducted, I was able to internally rotate the hip to 45 degrees.  After verifying the stability and range of motion in all direction, trial components were removed.  The canal was thoroughly irrigated and dry sponge was inserted and canal was dried completely.  At this point, 2 batches of SmartSet cement with antibiotics were mixed.  The definitive Ultima calcar stem size 3 with 45 mm calcar body was selected.  Centralizer was positioned.  The cement restrictor was inserted.  Retrograde cementing technique was applied once the canal was dried.  Using cement gun, retrograde cementing was performed.  The stem was then inserted into cemented canal with appropriate anteversion, which was maintained until the cement was set hard and cured.  The excess cement was removed with the help of a curette and Freer elevator.  All the cement debris was removed.,Attention was now placed for the insertion of the trial femoral head.  Once again, 0 neck length trial bipolar head was inserted over the trunnion.  It was reduced and range of motion and stability was satisfactory.  I also attempted with a -3 trial head, but the 0 gave us a satisfactory stability, range of motion, as well as the length and the shuck was also minimal.  The hip was raised to 90 degrees of flexion and 95 degrees of internal rotation.  There was no evidence of any impingement on extension and external rotation as well as flexion-adduction, internal rotation.  I also tested the hip at 90 degrees of flexion with 10 degrees adduction and internal rotation and further progressive flexion of the hip beyond 90 degrees, which was noted to be very stable.  At this point, a definitive component using +0 neck length and bipolar 43 head were placed over the trunnion and the hip was reduced.  Range of motion and stability was as above.  Now, the attention was placed for the repair of the capsule and the external rotators and the piriformis.  This was repaired to the trochanteric insertion using #5 Ethibond and suture plaster.  Satisfactory reinforcement was achieved with the #5 Ethibond.  The wound was thoroughly irrigated.  Hemostasis was achieved.  The fascia was closed with #1 Vicryl followed by subcutaneous closure using 2-0 Vicryl.  The wound was thoroughly washed and a local injection with mixture of morphine and Toradol was infiltrated including the capsule and the pericapsular structures.  Skin was approximated with staples.  Sterile dressings were placed.  Abduction pillow was positioned and the patient was then extubated and transferred to the recovery room in a stable condition.  There were no intraoperative complications noted.',\n",

       " \"PROCEDURE PERFORMED:,1. Left heart catheterization with coronary angiography, vein graft angiography and left ventricular pressure measurement and angiography.,2. Right femoral selective angiogram.,3. Closure device the seal the femoral arteriotomy using an Angio-Seal.,INDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURE: ,The patient with known coronary atherosclerotic heart disease and multiple risk factors of coronary disease, who had her last coronary arteriogram performed in 2004. She has had complaints of progressive chest discomfort, and has ongoing risks including current smoking, diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia to name a few. The decision was made to proceed on with percutaneous evaluation and possible intervention given her known disease and the possibility of disease progression.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:, After informed consent was obtained, The patient was taken to cardiac catheterization lab where her procedure was performed. She was prepped and prepared on the table; after which, her right groin was locally anesthetized with 1% lidocaine. Then, a 6-French sheath was inserted into the right femoral artery over a standard 0.035 guide wire. Coronary angiography and left ventricular measurement and angiography were performed using a 6-French JL4 diagnostic catheter to image the left coronary artery. A 6-French JR4 diagnostic catheter to image the right groin and her artery and the saphenous vein graft conduit. Subsequently, a 6-French angled pigtail catheter was used to measure left ventricular pressures and to perform a power injection, a left ventriculogram at 8 mL per second for a total of 30 mL. At the conclusion of the diagnostic evaluation, the patient had selective arteriography of her right femoral artery, which showed the right femoral artery to be free of significant atherosclerotic plaque. Did have a normal bifurcation into the superficial femoral and profunda femoris arteries and to have an arteriotomy that was in the common femoral artery away from the bifurcation. As such, an initial attempt to advance a Perclose device failed to allow the device descend to _____ tract and into the appropriate position within the artery. As such, the Perclose was never deployed and was removed intact over the wire from the system. We then replaced this with a 6-French Angio-Seal which was used to seal the femoral arteriotomy with achievement of hemostasis. The patient was subsequently dispositioned back to the MAC Unit where she will complete her bedrest prior to her disposition to home.,HEMODYNAMIC DATA:, Opening aortic pressure 125/60, left ventricular pressure 108/4 with an end-diastolic pressure of 16. There was no significant gradient across the aortic valve on pullback from the left ventricle. Left ventricular ejection fraction was 55%. Mitral regurgitation was less than or equal to 1+. There was normal wall motion in the RAO projection.,CORONARY ANGIOGRAM:, The left main coronary artery had mild atherosclerotic plaque. The proximal LAD was 100% occluded. The left circumflex had mild diffuse atherosclerotic plaque. The obtuse marginal branch which operates as an OM-2 had a mid approximately 80% stenosis at a kink in the artery. This appears to be the area of a prior anastomosis, the saphenous vein graft to the OM. This is a very small-caliber vessel and is 1.5-mm in diameter at best. The right coronary artery is dominant. The native right coronary artery had mild proximal and mid atherosclerotic plaque. The distal right coronary artery has an approximate 40% stenosis. The posterior left ventricular branch has a proximal 50 to 60% stenosis. The proximal PDA has a 40 to 50% stenosis. The saphenous vein graft to the right PDA is widely patent. There was competitive flow noted between the native right coronary artery and the saphenous vein graft to the PDA. The runoff from the PDA is nice with the native proximal PDA and PLV disease as noted above. There is also some retrograde filling of the right coronary artery from the runoff of this graft. The saphenous vein graft to the left anterior descending is widely patent. The LAD beyond the distal anastomosis is a relatively small-caliber vessel. There is some retrograde filling that allows some filling into a more proximal diagonal branch. The saphenous vein graft to the obtuse marginal was known to be occluded from the prior study in 2004. Overall, this study does not look markedly different than the procedure performed in 2004.,CONCLUSION:, 100% proximal LAD mild left circumflex disease with an OM that is a small-caliber vessel with an 80% lesion at a kink that is no amenable to percutaneous intervention. The native right coronary artery has mild to moderate distal disease with moderate PLV and PDA disease. The saphenous vein graft to the OM is known to be 100% occluded. The saphenous vein graft to the PDA and the saphenous vein graft to the LAD are open. Normal left ventricular systolic function.,PLAN:, The plan will be for continued medical therapy and risk factor modification. Aggressive antihyperlipidemic and antihypertensive control. The patient's goal LDL will be at or below 70 with triglyceride level at or below 150, and it is very imperative that the patient stop smoking.,After her bedrest is complete, she will be dispositioned to home, after which, she will be following up with me in the office within 1 month. We will also plan to perform a carotid duplex Doppler ultrasound to evaluate her carotid bruits.\",\n",

The patient was felt to be a candidate for decompression stabilization pulling distraction between the screws to relieve radicular pain.  The patient understood major risks and complications such as death and paralysis seemingly rare, main concern is a 10 to 15% of failure rate to respond to surgery for which further surgery may or may not be indicated, small risk of wound infection, spinal fluid leak.  The patient is understanding and agreed to proceed and signed the consent.,PROCEDURE: , The patient was brought to the operating room, peripheral venous lines were placed.  General anesthesia was induced.  The patient was intubated.  Foley catheter was in place.  The patient laid prone onto the OSI table using 6-post, pressure points were carefully padded; the back was shaved, sterilely prepped and draped.  A previous incision was infiltrated with local and incised with a scalpel.  The posterior spine on the right side was exposed in routine fashion along with transverse processes in L4-L5 in the sacral ala.  Laminotomies were then performed at L4-L5 and L5-S1 in a similar fashion using Midas Rex drill with AM8 bit, inferior portion of lamina below and superior portion of lamina above, and the medial facet was drilled down to the thin shelf of bone.  The thin shelf of bone along the ligamentum flavum moved in a piecemeal fashion with 2 and 3 mm Kerrison, bone was harvested throughout to be used for bone grafting.  The L5 and S1 roots were completely unroofed in the lateral recess working lateral to the markedly hypertrophied facet joints.  Transpedicular approaches were carried out for both L4 and L5 roots working lateral to medial and medial to lateral with foraminotomies, L4-L5 roots were extensively decompressed.  Pars interarticularis were maintained.  Using angled 2-mm Kerrisons hypertrophied ligamentum flavum, the superior facet of S1 and L5 was resected increasing the dimensions for the foramen passed lateral to medial and medial to lateral without further compromise.  Pedicle screws were placed L4-L5 and S1 on the right side.  Initial hole began with Midas Rex drill, deepened with a gear shift and with 4.5 mm tap, palpating with pedicle probe.  It showed no penetration outside the pedicle vertebral body.  At L4-L5 5.5 x 45 mm screws were placed and at S1 5.5 x 40 mm screw was placed.  Good bone purchase was obtained.  Gelfoam was placed over the roots laterally, corticated transverse processes lateral facet joints were prepared, small infuse sponge was placed posterolaterally on the right side, then the local bone graft from L4 to S1.  Traction was applied between the L4-L5, L5-S1 screws locking notes were tightened out, heads were rotated fractured off about 2-3 mm traction were applied at each side, further opening the foramen for the exiting roots.  Prior to placement of BMP, the wound was irrigated with antibiotic irrigation.  Medium Hemovac drain was placed in the depth of wound, brought out through a separate stab incision.  Deep fascia was closed with #1 Vicryl, subcutaneous fascia with #1 Vicryl, and subcuticular with 2-0 Vicryl.  Skin was stapled.  The drain was sutured in place with 2-0 Vicryl and connected to closed drain system.  The patient was laid supine on the bed, extubated, and taken to recovery room in satisfactory condition.  The patient tolerated the procedure well without apparent complication.  Final sponge and needle counts are correct.

Venography.,PROCEDURE NOTE: , After informed consent was obtained, the patient was taken to the operating room.  The patient was prepped and draped in a sterile fashion.  Using modified Seldinger technique, the left subclavian vein was attempted to be punctured but unsuccessfully.  Approximately 10 cc of intravenous contrast was injected into the left upper extremity peripheral vein.  Venogram was then performed.  Under fluoroscopy via modified Seldinger technique, the left subclavian vein was punctured and a guidewire was passed through the vein into the superior vena cava, then the right atrium and then into the inferior vena cava.  A second guidewire was placed in a similar fashion.  Approximately a 5 cm incision was made in the left upper anterior chest.  The skin and subcutaneous tissue was dissected out of the prepectoral fascia.  Both guide wires were brought into the pocket area.  A sheath was placed over the lateral guidewire and fluoroscopically guided to the vena cava.  The dilator and guidewire were removed.  A Fixation ventricular lead, under fluoroscopic guidance, was placed through the sheath into the superior vena cava, right atrium and then right ventricle.  Using straight and curved stylettes, it was placed in position and screwed into the right ventricular apex.  After pacing and sensing parameters were established in the lead, the collar on the lead was sutured to the pectoral muscle with Ethibond suture.  A guide sheath was placed over the guidewire and fluoroscopically placed in the superior vena cava.  The dilator and guidewire were removed.  An Active Fixation atrial lead was fluoroscopically passed through the sheath, into the superior vena cava and then the right atrium.  Using straight and J-shaped stylettes, it was placed in the appropriate position and screwed in the right atrial appendage area.  After significant pacing parameters were established in the lead, the collar on the lead was sutured to the pectoral muscles with Ethibond suture.  The tract was flushed with saline solution.  A Medtronic pulse generator was attached to both the leads and fixed to the pectoral muscle with Ethibond suture.  Deep and superficial layers were closed with 3-0 Vicryl in a running fashion.  Steri-strips were placed over the incision.  Tegaderm was placed over the Steri-strips.  Pressure dressing was applied to the pocket area.',\n",

Medial malleolus osteotomy.,3.  Repair of deltoid ligament.,ANESTHESIA: , Spinal.,TOURNIQUET TIME: , 90 min.,BLOOD LOSS:,  50 cc.,The patient is in the semilateral position on the beanbag.,INTRAOPERATIVE FINDINGS:,  A comminuted Hawkins IV talus fracture with an incomplete rupture of the deltoid ligament.  There was no evidence of osteochondral defects of the talar dome.,HISTORY:  ,This is a 50-year-old male who presented to ABCD General Hospital Emergency Department with complaints of left ankle pain and disfigurement.  There was no open injury.  The patient fell approximately 10 feet off his liner, landing on his left foot.  There was evidence of gross deformity of the ankle.  An x-ray was performed in the Emergency Room, which revealed a grade IV Hawkins classification talus fracture.  He was distal neurovascularly intact.  The patient denied any other complaints besides pain in the ankle.,It was for this reason, we elected to undergo the above-named procedure in order to reduce and restore the blood supply to the talus body.  Because of its tenuous blood supply, the patient is at risk for avascular necrosis.  The patient has agreed to undergo the above-named procedure and consent was obtained.  All risks as well as complications were discussed.,PROCEDURE: , The patient was brought back to operative room #4 of ABCD General Hospital on 08/20/03.  A spinal anesthetic was administered.  A nonsterile tourniquet was placed on the left upper thigh, but not inflated.  He was then positioned on the beanbag.  The extremity was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion for this procedure.  An Esmarch was then used to exsanguinate the extremity and the tourniquet was then inflated to 325 mmHg.  At this time, an anteromedial incision was made in order to perform a medial malleolus osteotomy to best localize the fracture region in order to be able to bone graft the comminuted fracture site.  At this time, a #15 blade was used to make approximately 10 cm incision over the medial malleolus.  This was curved anteromedial along the root of the saphenous vein.  The saphenous vein was located.  Its tributaries going plantar were cauterized and the vein was retracted anterolaterally.  At this time, we identified the medial malleolus.  There was evidence of approximately 80% avulsion, rupture of the deltoid ligament off of the medial malleolus.  This was a major blood feeder to the medial malleolus and we were concerned, once we were going to do the osteotomy, that this would later create healing problem.  It is for this reason that the pedicle, which was attached to the medial malleolus, was left intact.  This pedicle was the anterior portion of the deltoid ligament.  At this time, a MicroChoice saw was then used to make a box osteotomy of the medial malleolus.  Once this was performed, the medial malleolus was retracted anterolaterally with its remaining pedicle intact for later blood supply.  This provided us with excellent exposure to the fracture site of the medial side.  At this time, any loose comminuted pieces were removed.  The dome of the talus was also checked and did not reveal any osteochondral defects.  There was some comminution on the dorsal aspect of the complete talus fracture and we were concerned that once we place the screw, this would tend to extend the fracture site.  It is for this reason, we did the medial malleolar osteotomy to prevent this from happening in order to best expose the fracture site.  At this time, a reduction was performed.  The #7-0 partially threaded cannulated screws were used in order to fix the fracture.  At this time, a 3.2 mm guidewire was placed going from posterolateral to anteromedial.,This was placed slightly lateral to the Achilles tendon, percutaneously inserted, and then drilled in the according fashion across the fracture site.  Once this was performed, a skin knife was then used to incise over the percutaneous insertion in order to accommodate the screw going in.  A depth gauze was then used to measure screw length.  A cannulated drill was then used to drill across the fracture site to allow the entrance of the screw.  A 55 mm partially threaded #7-0 cannulated screw was then placed with excellent compression at the fracture site.  Once this was obtained, we checked the reduction again using intraoperative Xi-Scan in the AP and lateral direction.  This projection gave us excellent view of our screw placement and excellent compression across the fracture site.  At this time, we bone grafted the area of comminution using 1 cc of DynaGraft with crushed cancellous allograft.  This was placed using a freer elevator into the fracture site where the comminution was.  At this time, we copiously irrigated the wound.  The osteotomy site was then repaired, first clamped using two large tenaculum reduction clamps.  Two partially threaded #4-0 cannulated screws were then used to fix the osteotomy site and anatomical reduction was performed with excellent compression across the osteotomy site with the two screws.  Next, a #1-0 Vicryl was then used to repair the deltoid ligament, which was ruptured via the injury.  A tight repair was performed of the deltoid ligament.  At this time, again copious irrigation was used to irrigate the wound.  A #2-0 Vicryl was then used to approximate the subcutaneous skin and staples for the skin incision.  At this time, the leg was cleansed, Adaptic, 4 x 4, and Kerlix roll were then applied.  The patient was then placed in a plaster splint for mobilization.  The tourniquet was then released.  The patient was then transferred off the operating table to recovery in stable condition.  The prognosis for this fracture is guarded.  There is a high rate of avascular necrosis of the talar body, approximately anywhere from 40-60% risk.  The patient is aware of this and he will be followed as an outpatient for this problem.',\n",

A viable male neonate with Apgars of 9 and 9 at 1 and 5 minutes respectively.  Infant weight equaled to 4140 gm with clear amniotic fluid.  The umbilical cord was wrapped around the leg tightly x1.  Infant was in a vertex, right occiput anterior position.,INDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURE:  ,The patient is a 19-year-old G1 P0 at 41 and 1/7th weeks' intrauterine pregnancy.  She presented at mid night on 08/22/03 complaining of spontaneous rupture of membranes, which was confirmed in Labor and Delivery.  The patient had a positive group beta strep colonization culture and was started on penicillin.  The patient was also started on Pitocin protocol at that time.  The patient was monitored throughout the morning showing some irregular contractions every 5 to 6 minutes and then eventually no contractions on the monitor.  IUPC was placed without difficulty and contractions appeared to be regular, however, they were inadequate amount of the daily units.  The patient was given a rest from the Pitocin.  She walked and had a short shower.  The patient was then placed back on Pitocin with IUPC in place and we were unable to achieve adequate contractions.  Maximum cervical dilation was 5 cm, 80% effaced, negative 2 station, and cephalic position.  At the time of C-section, the patient had been ruptured for over 24 hours and it was determined that she would not progress in her cervical dilation, as there was suspected macrosomia on ultrasound.  Options were discussed with the patient and family and it was determined that we will take her for C-section today.  Consent was signed.  All questions were answered with Dr. X present.,PROCEDURE: , The patient was taken to the operative suite where a spinal anesthetic was placed.  She was placed in the dorsal supine position with left upward tilt.  She was prepped and draped in the normal sterile fashion and her spinal anesthetic was found to adequate.  A Pfannenstiel incision was made with a first scalpel and carried through the underlying layer of fascia with a second scalpel.  The fascia was incised in the midline and extended laterally using curved Mayo scissors.  The superior aspect of the fascial incision was grasped with Ochsner and Kocher clamps and elevated off the rectus muscles.  Attention was then turned to the inferior aspect of the incision where Kocher clamps were used to elevate the fascia off the underlying rectus muscle.  The rectus muscle was separated in the midline bluntly.  The underlying peritoneum was tented up with Allis clamps and incised using Metzenbaum scissors.  The peritoneum was then bluntly stretched.  The bladder blade was placed.  The vesicouterine peritoneum was identified, tented up with Allis' and entered sharply with Metzenbaum scissors.  The incision was extended laterally and the bladder flap created digitally.  The bladder blade was then reinserted in the lower uterine segment.  A low transverse uterine incision was made with a second scalpel.  The uterine incision was extended laterally bluntly.  The bladder blade was removed and the infant's head was delivered with the assistance of a vacuum.  Infant's nose and mouth were bulb suctioned and the body was delivered atraumatically.  There was, of note, an umbilical cord around the leg tightly x1.,Cord was clamped and cut.  Infant was handed to the waiting pediatrician.  Cord gas was sent for pH as well as blood typing.  The placenta was manually removed and the uterus was exteriorized and cleared of all clots and debris.  The uterine incision was grasped circumferentially with Alfred clamps and closed with #0-Chromic in a running locked fashion.  A second layer of imbricating stitch was performed using #0-Chromic suture to obtain excellent hemostasis.  The uterus was returned to the abdomen.  The gutters were cleared of all clots and debris.  The rectus muscle was loosely approximated with #0-Vicryl suture in a single interrupted fashion.  The fascia was reapproximated with #0-Vicryl suture in a running fashion.  The subcutaneous Scarpa's fascia was then closed with #2-0 plain gut.  The skin was then closed with staples.  The incision was dressed with sterile dressing and bandage.  Blood clots were evacuated from the vagina.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  The sponge, lap, and needle counts were correct x2.  The mother was taken to the recovery room in stable and satisfactory condition.\",\n",
       " \"HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , The patient is a 35-year-old woman who reports that on the 30th of October 2008, she had a rupture of her membranes at nine months of pregnancy, and was admitted to hospital and was given an epidural anesthetic.  I do not have the records from this hospital admission, but apparently the epidural was administered for approximately 14 to 18 hours.  She was sitting up during the epidural.,She did not notice any difference in her lower extremities at the time she had the epidural; however, she reports that she was extremely sleepy and may not have been aware of any change in strength or sensation in her lower extremities at that time.  She delivered on the 31st of October, by Cesarean section, because she had failed to progress and had pyrexia.,She also had a Foley catheter placed at that time.  On the 1st of November 2008, they began to mobilize her and it was at that time that she first noticed that she could not walk.  She was aware that she could not move her legs at all, and then within a few days, she was aware that she could move toes in the left foot but could not move her right foot at all.  Since that time, there has been a gradual improvement in strength to the point that she now has limited movement in her left leg and severely restricted movement in her right leg.  She is not able to walk by herself, and needs assistance to stand.  She was discharged from hospital after the Cesarean section on the 3rd of November.  Unfortunately, we do not have the records and we do not know what the discussion was between the anesthesiologist and the patient at the time of discharge.  She was then seen at ABC Hospital on November 05, 2008.  She had an MRI scan of her spine, which showed no evidence of an abnormality, specifically there were no cord changes and no evidence of a hematoma.  She also had an EMG study at that time by Dr. X, which was abnormal but not diagnostic and this was repeated again in December.  At the present time, she also complains of a pressure in both her legs and in her thighs.  She complains that her right foot hurts and that she has some hyperesthesia there.  She has been taking gabapentin to try to reduce the discomfort, although she is on a very low dose and the effect is minimal.  She has no symptoms in her arms, her bowel and bladder function is normal, and her bulbar function is normal.  There is no problem with her vision, swallowing, or respiratory function.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: , Unremarkable except as noted above.  She has seasonal allergies.,CURRENT MEDICATIONS:,  Gabapentin 300 mg b.i.d., Centrum once a day, and another multivitamin.,ALLERGIES: , She has no medication allergies, but does have seasonal allergies.,FAMILY HISTORY: , There is a family history of diabetes and hypertension.  There is no family history of a neuropathy or other neurological disease.  She has one child, a son, born on October 31, 2008.,SOCIAL HISTORY: , The patient is a civil engineer, who currently works from home.  She is working approximately half time because of limitations imposed on her by her disability, need to attend frequent physical therapy, and also the needs of looking after her baby.  She does not smoke and does not drink and has never done either.,GENERAL PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,VITAL SIGNS:  P 74, BP 144/75, and a pain score of 0.,GENERAL:  Her general physical examination was unremarkable.,CARDIOVASCULAR:  Normal first and second heart sound, regular pulse with normal volume.,RESPIRATORY:  Unremarkable, both lung bases were clear, and respiration was normal.,GI:  Unremarkable, with no organomegaly and normal bowel sounds.,NEUROLOGICAL EXAM:,MSE:  The patient's orientation was normal, fund of knowledge was normal, memory was normal, speech was normal, calculation was normal, and immediate and long-term recall was normal.  Executive function was normal.,CRANIAL NERVES:  The cranial nerve examination II through XII was unremarkable.  Both disks were normal, with normal retina.  Pupils were equal and reactive to light.  Eye movements were full.  Facial sensation and strength was normal.  Bulbar function was normal.  The trapezius had normal strength.,MOTOR:  Muscle tone showed a slight increase in tone in the lower extremities, with normal tone in the upper extremities.  Muscle strength was 5/5 in all muscle groups in the upper extremities.  In the lower extremities, the hip flexors were 1/5 bilaterally, hip extensors were 1/5 bilaterally, knee extension on the right was 1/5 and on the left was 3-/5, knee flexion was 2/5 on the right and 3-/5 on the left, foot dorsiflexion was 0/5 on the right and 1/5 on the left, foot plantar flexion was 4-/5 on the right and 4+/5 on the left, toe extension was 0/5 on the right and 4-/5 on the left, toe flexion was 4-/5 on the right and 4+/5 on the left.,REFLEXES:  Reflexes in the upper extremities were 2+ bilaterally.  In the lower extremities, they were 0 bilaterally at the knee and ankles.  The abdominal reflexes were present above the umbilicus and absent below the umbilicus.  The plantar responses were mute.  The jaw reflex was normal.,SENSATION:  Vibration was moderately decreased in the right great toe and was mildly decreased in the left great toe.  There was a sensory level to light touch at approximately T7 posteriorly and approximately T9 anteriorly.  There was a range of sensation, but clearly there was a decrease in sensation below this level but not complete loss of sensation.  To pain, the sensory level is even less clear, but appeared to be at about T7 on the right side.  In the lower extremities, there was a slight decrease in pin and light touch in the right great toe compared to the left.  There was no evidence of allodynia or hyperesthesia.  Joint position sense was mildly reduced in the right toe and normal on the left.,COORDINATION:  Coordination for rapid alternating movements and finger-to-nose testing was normal.  Coordination could not be tested in the lower extremities.,GAIT:  The patient was unable to stand and therefore we were unable to test gait or Romberg's.  There was no evidence of focal back tenderness.,REVIEW OF OUTSIDE RECORDS: , I have reviewed the records from ABC Hospital, including the letter from Dr. Y and the EMG report dated 12/17/2008 from Dr. X. The EMG report shows evidence of a lumbosacral polyradiculopathy below approximately T6.  The lower extremity sensory responses are essentially normal; however, there is a decrease in the amplitude of the motor responses with minimal changes in latency.  I do have the MRI of lumbar spine report from 11/06/2008 with and without contrast.  This showed a minimal concentric disc bulge of L4-L5 without disc herniation, but was otherwise unremarkable.  The patient brought a disc with a most recent MRI study; however, we were unable to open this on our computers.  The verbal report is that the study was unremarkable except for some gadolinium enhancement in the lumbar nerve roots.  A Doppler of the lower extremities showed no evidence of deep venous thrombosis in either lower extremity.  Chest x-ray showed some scoliosis on the lumbar spine, curve to the left, but no evidence of other abnormalities.  A CT pelvis study performed on November 07, 2008 showed some nonspecific fluid in the subcutaneous fat of the back, posterior to L4 and L5 levels; however, there were no pelvic masses or other abnormalities.  We were able to obtain an update of the report from the MRI of the lumbar spine with and without contrast dated 12/30/2008.  The complete study included the cervical, thoracic, and lumbar spine.  There was diffuse enhancement of the nerve roots of the cauda equina that had increased in enhancement since prior exam in November.  It was also reported that the patient was given intravenous methylprednisolone and this had had no effect on strength in her lower extremities.,IMPRESSION: , The patient has a condition that is temporarily related to the epidural injection she was given at the end of October 2008, prior to her Cesarean section.  It appears she became aware of weakness within two days of the administration of the epidural, she was very tired during the epidural and may have missed some change in her neurological function.  She was severely weak in both lower extremities, slightly worse on the right than the left.  There has been some interval improvement in her strength since the beginning of November 2008.  Her EMG study from the end of December is most consistent with a lumbosacral polyradiculopathy.  The MRI findings of gadolinium enhancement in the lumbar nerve roots would be most consistent with an inflammatory radiculitis most likely related to the epidural anesthesia or administration of the epidural.  There had been no response to IV methylprednisolone given to her at ABC.  The issue of having a lumbar puncture to look for evidence of inflammatory cells or an elevated protein had been discussed with her at both ABC and by myself.  The patient did not wish to consider a lumbar puncture because of concerns that this might worsen her condition.  At the present time, she is able to stand with aid but is unable to walk.  There is no evidence on her previous EMG of a demyelinating neuropathy.,RECOMMENDATIONS:,1.  The diagnostic issues were discussed with the patient at length.  She is informed that this is still early in the course of the problem and that we expect her to show some improvement in her function over the next one to two years, although it is unclear as to how much function she will regain.,2.  She is strongly recommended to continue with vigorous physical therapy, and to continue with the plan to mobilize her as much as possible, with the goal of trying to get her ambulatory.  If she is able to walk, she will need bilateral AFOs for her ankles, to improve her overall mobility.  I am not prescribing these because at the present time she does not need them.,3.  We discussed increasing the dose of gabapentin.  The paresthesias that she has may indicate that she is actually regaining some sensory function, although there is a concern that as recovery continues, she may be left with significant neuropathic pain.  If this is the case, I have advised her to increase her gabapentin dose from 300 mg b.i.d. gradually up to 300 mg four times a day and then to 600 mg to 900 mg four times a day.  She may need other neuropathic pain medications as needed.  She will determine whether her current symptoms are significant enough to require this increase in dosage.,4.  The patient will follow up with Dr. Y and his team at ABC Hospital.  She will also continue with physical therapy within the ABC system.\",\n",

After induction of general endotracheal anesthesia, the McIvor mouth gag was placed in the oral cavity and a tongue depressor applied.  Two #12-French red rubber Robinson catheters were placed, 1 in each nasal passage, and brought out through the oral cavity and clamped over a dental gauze roll placed on the upper lip to provide soft palate retraction.,Attention was directed to the nasopharynx.  With the Bovie set at 50 coag and the suction Bovie tip on the suction hose, the adenoid bed was fulgurated by beginning at the posterosuperior aspect of the nasopharynx at the apex of the choana placing the tip of the suction cautery deep at the root of the adenoids next to the roof of the nasopharynx and then in a linear fashion making serial passages through the base of the adenoid fossa in parallel lines until the entire nasopharynx and adenoid bed had been fulgurated moving from posterior to anterior.  The McIvor was relaxed and attention was then directed to the ears.,The left external auditory canal was examined under the operating microscope and cleaned of ceruminous debris.,An anteroinferior quadrant tympanostomy incision was made.  Fluid was suctioned from the middle ear space, and a tympanostomy tube was placed at the level of the incision and pushed into position with the Rosen needle.  Cortisporin ear drops were instilled into the canal, and a cotton ball was placed in the external meatus.,By a similar procedure, the opposite tympanostomy and tube placement were accomplished.,The patient tolerated the procedure well and left the operating room in good condition.',\n",

The patient has a long history of crippling severe rheumatoid arthritis.  She has pain with shoe gear and pain with every step.  She has tried multiple conservative measures under Dr. X's supervision consisting of wide shoe's and accommodative padding all which have provided inadequate relief.  At this time, she desires attempted surgical reconstruction/correction.  The consent is available on the chart for review and the risks versus benefits of this procedure have been discussed with patient in detail by Dr. X.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , After IV was established by the Department of Anesthesia, the patient was taken to the operating room via cart and placed on the operating table in a supine position and a safety strap was placed across her waist for her protection.  Next, copious amounts of Webril were applied about the right ankle and a pneumatic ankle tourniquet was applied over the Webril.  Next, after adequate IV sedation was administered by the Department of Anesthesia, a total of 20 cc of 1:1 mixture of 0.5% Marcaine plain and 1% lidocaine were instilled into the right foot using a standard ankle block technique.  Next, the foot was prepped and draped in the usual aseptic fashion.  An Esmarch bandage was used to exsanguinate the foot and the pneumatic ankle tourniquet was elevated to 230 mmHg.  The foot was lowered in the operative field.  The sterile stockinette was reflected and attention was directed to the right first metatarsophalangeal joint.  The joint was found to be severely contracted with lateral deviation of the hallux with a slightly overlapping contracted second toe.  In addition, the range of motion was less than 5 degrees of the first ray.  There was medial pinch callus and callus on the plantar right second metatarsal.  Using a #10 blade, a linear incision over the first metatarsophalangeal joint was then created approximately 4 cm in length.  Next, a #15 blade was used to deepen the incision to the subcutaneous tissue all which was found to be very thin taking care to protect the medial neurovascular bundle and the lateral extensor hallucis longus tendon.  Any small vein traversing the operative site were clamped with hemostat and ligated with electrocautery.  Next, the medial and lateral wound margins were undermined with sharp dissection.  The joint capsule was then visualized.  Two apparent soft tissue masses probably consistent with rheumatoid nodules were found at the distal medial aspect of the first metatarsal capsule.  A dorsal linear incision to the capsular tissue down to bone was performed with a #15 blade.  The capsule and periosteal tissues were elevated sharply off the metatarsal head and the base of proximal  phalanx.,A large amount of hypertrophic synovium was encountered over the metatarsophalangeal joint.  In addition, multiple hypertrophic exostosis were found dorsally, medially, and laterally over the metatarsal.  Upon entering the joint, the base of the proximal phalanx was grossly deformed and the medial and lateral aspect were widely flared and encompassing the metatarsal head.  A sagittal saw was used to carefully remove the base of the proximal phalanx just distal to the metaphyseal flare.  Next, the bone was passed out as specimen.  The head of the metatarsal had evidence of erosion and eburnation.  The tibial sesamoid was practically absent, but was found to be a conglomeration of hypertrophic synovium and poorly differentiated appearing exostosis and bony tissue.  This was hindering the range of motion of the joint and was removed.  The fibular sesamoid was in the interspace.  A lateral release was performed in addition.  Next, the McGlamry elevators were inserted into the first metatarsal head and all of the plantar adhesions were freed.  The metatarsal head was remodeled with a sagittal saw and all of the medial eminence the dorsal and lateral hypertropic bone was removed and the metatarsal head was shaped into more acceptable contoured structure.  Next, the Biopro sizer was used and it was found that a median large implant would be the best fit for this patient's joint.  A small drill hole was made in the central aspect at the base of the proximal phalanx.  The trial sizer median large was placed in the joint and an excellent fit and increased range of motion was observed.,Next, the joint was flushed with copious amounts of saline.  A median large porous Biopro implant was inserted using the standard technique and was tapped with the mallet into position.  It had an excellent fit and the range of motion again was markedly increased from the preoperative level.  Next, the wound was again flushed with copious amounts of saline.  The flexor tendon was inspected and was found to be intact plantarly.  A #3-0 Vicryl was used to close the capsule in a running fashion.  A medial capsulorrhaphy performed and the toe assumed to more rectus position and the joint was more congruous.  Next, the subcutaneous layer was closed with #4-0 Vicryl in a simple interrupted technique.  Next, the skin was closed with #5-0 Monocryl in a running subcuticular fashion.,Attention was directed to the right second toe, which was found to be markedly contracted and rigid in nature.  There was a clavus in the dorsal aspect of the head of the proximal phalanx noted.  A linear incision was made over the proximal phalanx approximately 2 cm in length.  The incision was deepened with #15 blade down to the subcutaneous tissue.  Next, the medial and lateral aspects of the wound were undermined with sharp dissection taking care to protect the neurovascular structures.,Next, after identifying the extensor expansion and long extensor tendon, a #15 blade was used to transect the tendon at the level of the joint.  The tendon was peeled off sharply, proximally, and distally.  The medial and lateral collateral ligaments were released and the head of the proximal phalanx was delivered into the wound.  The bone was found to be extremely soft in the toe joints and the head of the proximal phalanx was oddly shaped and the cartilage was eroded.  The base of the middle phalanx, however, had a normal-appearing cartilage.  A sagittal saw was used to transect the head of the proximal phalanx just proximal to metaphyseal flare.  Next, the base of the middle phalanx was also resected.  A 0.045 inch Kirschner wire was retrograded out at the end of the toe and then back through the residual proximal phalanx shaft.  The toe assumed a straight and markedly increased straight position.  An extensor hood resection was performed to assist in keeping the proximal phalanx plantar flexed.  The joint was flushed with copious amounts of saline.  A #3-0 Vicryl was used to reapproximate the tendon after arthrodesis.  A #4-0 nylon was used to close the skin with a combination of simple interrupted and horizontal mattress suture technique.  The wire was cut, capped, and bent in the usual fashion.,Attention was directed to the right third toe where an exact same procedure as performed in the second digit was repeated.  The same suture material was used and the same 0.045 Kirschner wire was used for external wire fixation.,Attention was directed to the right fourth toe with exact same procedure was repeated.  The same suture material was used.  However, a 0.062 Kirschner wire was used to fixate the arthrodesis site as the bone was very soft and a 0.045 Kirschner wire was attempted but was found to be slipping in the soft bone and was inadequately holding the arthrodesis site tight.  Next, attention was directed to the fifth digit, which was found to be contracted as well.  A linear incision was made over the proximal phalanx with a #10 blade approximately 2 cm in length.  A #15 blade was used to deepen the incision to the subcutaneous tissue down to the level of the long extensor tendon, which was identified and transected.  The medial and lateral collateral ligaments were transected and the head of the proximal phalanx was delivered into the wound.  A sagittal saw was used to resect the head of the proximal phalanx just proximal to metaphyseal flare.  The toe assumed to more rectus position.  The reciprocating rasp was used to smooth the all bony surfaces.  The joint was again flushed with saline.  Next, the long extensor tendon was reapproximated with #3-0 Vicryl in a simple interrupted technique.  The skin was closed with #4-0 nylon in a simple interrupted technique.,Next, attention was directed to the fifth metatarsal head, which was found to have a lateral exostosis and bursa under the skin.  A #10 blade was used to make a 2.5 cm dorsal incision over the fifth metatarsal head.  The incision was deepened with a #15 blade to the subcutaneous tissue.  Any small vein traversing subcutaneous layer were ligated with electrocautery.  Care was taken to avoid abductor digiti minimi tendon and extensor digitorum longus tendon respectively.  Next, the dorsal linear capsular incision was made down to the bone with a #15 blade.  The capsular and periosteal tissues were elevated off the bone with a #15 blade and the metatarsal head was delivered into the wound.  Hypertrophic bone was noted to be found dorsally and laterally as well as plantarly.  A sagittal saw was used to resect all hypertrophic bone.  A reciprocating rasp was used to smooth all bony surfaces.  Next, the wound was flushed with copious amounts of saline.  The capsular and periosteal tissues wee closed with #3-0 Vicryl in a simple interrupted technique.  Next, the subcutaneous layer was closed with #4-0 Vicryl in a simple interrupted technique.  A bursa which was found consisting of a white glistening hypertrophic synovium was removed and sent as specimen as was also found in two of the second and third digit in the above procedures.  The skin was closed with #5-0 Monocryl in a running subcuticular fashion.  The ______ was reinforced with horizontal mattress sutures with #5-0 Monocryl.  Attention was directed to the fourth metatarsophalangeal joint where the joint was found to be contracted and the proximal phalanx was still found to be elevated.  Therefore, a #15 blade was used to make a stab incision over the joint lateral to the extensor digitorum longus tendon.  The tendon was transected.  Next, a blade was inserted in the dorsal, medial, and lateral aspects of the metatarsophalangeal joint and tenotomy was performed.  Next, the proximal phalanx residual bone was plantar flexed and found to assume a more rectus position.  One #4-0 nylon suture was placed in the skin.,Mastisol tape was applied to the first metatarsal and fifth metatarsal postoperative wounds.  Betadine-soaked Owen silk was applied to all wounds.  Betadine-soaked 4 x 4 splints were applied to all toes.  The pneumatic ankle tourniquet was released and immediate hyperemic flush was noted to all digits.  All the wires have previously been bent and cut and all were capped.  A standard postoperative consisting of 4x4s, Kling, Kerlix, and Coban were applied.  The patient tolerated the above anesthesia and procedure without complications.  She was transported via cart to the Postanesthesia Care Unit with vital signs stable and vascular status intact.  She was given prescription for Tylenol #3, #40 one to two p.o. q.4-6h. p.r.n. pain and Naprosyn 375 mg p.o. b.i.d. p.c.  She is to continue her rheumatoid arthritis drugs preoperatively prescribed by the rheumatologist.,She is to follow up with Dr. X in the office.  She was given emergency contact numbers and standard postoperative instructions.  She was given Darco OrthoWedge shoe and a pair of crutches.  She was discharged in stable condition.\",\n",

After induction of general endotracheal anesthesia, the McIvor mouth gag was placed in the oral cavity and a tongue depressor applied.  Two #12-French red rubber Robinson catheters were placed, 1 in each nasal passage, and brought out through the oral cavity and clamped over a dental gauze roll on the upper lip to provide soft palate retraction.  The nasopharynx was inspected with the laryngeal mirror.,Attention was then directed to the right tonsil.  The anterior tonsillar pillar was infiltrated with 1.5 cc of 1% Xylocaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine, as was the left tonsillar pillar.  The right tonsil was grasped with the tenaculum and retracted out of its fossa.  The anterior tonsillar pillar was incised with the #12 knife blade.  The plica semilunaris was incised with the Metzenbaum scissors.  Using the Metzenbaum scissors and the Fisher knife, the tonsil was dissected free of its fossa onto an inferior pedicle around which the tonsillar snare was placed and applied.  The tonsil was removed from the fossa and the fossa packed with a cherry gauze sponge as previously described.  By a similar procedure, the opposite tonsillectomy was performed and the fossa was packed.,Attention was re-directed to the right tonsil.  The pack was removed and bleeding was controlled with the suction Bovie unit.  Bleeding was then similarly controlled in the left tonsillar fossa and the nasopharynx after removal of the packs.

The patient presents to Labor and Delivery in active preterm labor and dilated approximately 4 to 6 cm.  The decision for C-section was made.,PROCEDURE:,  The patient was taken to the operating room and placed in a supine position with a slight left lateral tilt and she was then prepped and draped in usual fashion for a low transverse incision.  The patient was then given general anesthesia and once this was completed, first knife was used to make a low transverse incision extending down to the level of the fascia.  The fascia was nicked in the center and extended in a transverse fashion with the use of curved Mayo scissors.  The edges of the fascia were grasped with Kocher and both blunt and sharp dissection was then completed both caudally and cephalically.  The abdominal rectus muscle was divided in the center and extended in a vertical fashion.  Peritoneum was entered at a high point and extended in a vertical fashion as well.  The bladder blade was put in place.  The bladder flap was created with the use of Metzenbaum scissors and dissected away caudally.  The second knife was used to make a low transverse incision with care being taken to avoid the presenting part of the fetus.  The first fetus was vertex.  The fluid was clear.  The head was delivered followed by the remaining portion of the body.  The cord was doubly clamped and cut.  The newborn handed off to waiting pediatrician and nursery personnel.  The second fluid was ruptured.  It was the clear fluid as well.  The presenting part was brought down to be vertex.  The head was delivered followed by the rest of the body and the cord was doubly clamped and cut, and newborn handed off to waiting pediatrician in addition of the nursery personnel.  Cord pH blood and cord blood was obtained from both of the cords with careful identification of A and B. Once this was completed, the placenta was delivered and handed off for further inspection by Pathology.  At this time, it was noted at the uterus was adhered to the abdominal wall by approximately of 3 cm x 3 cm thick uterine adhesion and this was needed to be released by sharp dissection.  Then, there were multiple omental adhesions on the surface of the uterus itself.  This needed to be released as well as on the abdominal wall and then the uterus could be externalized.  The lining was wiped clean of any remaining blood and placental fragments and the edges of the uterus were grasped in four quadrants with Kocher and continuous locking stitch of 0 chromic was used to re-approximate the uterine incision, with the second layer used to imbricate the first.  The bladder flap was re-approximated with 3-0 Vicryl and Gelfoam underneath.  The right fallopian tube was grasped with a Babcock, it was doubly tied off with 0 chromic and the knuckle portion was then sharply incised and cauterized.  The same technique was completed on the left side with the knuckle portion cut off and cauterized as well.  The defect on the uterine surface was reinforced with 0 Vicryl in a baseball stitch to create adequate Hemostasis.  Interceed was placed over this area as well.  The abdominal cavity was irrigated with copious amounts of saline and the uterus was placed back in its anatomical position.  The gutters were wiped clean of any remaining blood.  The edges of the peritoneum were grasped with hemostats and a continuous locking stitch was used to re-approximate abdominal rectus muscles as well as the peritoneal edges.  The abdominal rectus muscle was irrigated.  The corners of the fascia grasped with hemostats and continuous locking stitch of 0 Vicryl started on both corners and overlapped on the center.  The subcutaneous tissue was irrigated.  Cautery was used to create adequate hemostasis and 3-0 Vicryl was used to re-approximate the subcutaneous tissue.  Skin edges were re-approximated with sterile staples.  Sterile dressing was applied.  Uterus was evacuated of any remaining blood vaginally.  The patient was taken to the recovery room in stable condition.  Instrument count, needle count, and sponge counts were all correct.',\n",

The patient was transported to the operative suite and on to the operative table in the supine position.  General endotracheal anesthesia was induced.  The head was placed on a well-padded head holder.  The eyes and face were protected from pressure.  A well-padded roll was placed beneath the neck and shoulders to help preserve the cervical lordosis.  The arms were tucked and draped to the sides.  All bony prominences were well padded.  An x-ray was taken to confirm the correct level of the skin incision.  The anterior neck was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.,A straight transverse skin incision over the left side of the anterior neck was made and carried down sharply through the skin and subcutaneous tissues to the level of the platysma muscle, which was divided transversely using the electrocautery.  The superficial and deep layers of the deep cervical fascia were divided.  The midline structures were reflected to the right side.  Care was taken during the dissection to avoid injury to the recurrent laryngeal nerve and the usual anatomical location of that nerve was protected.  The carotid sheath was palpated and protected laterally.  An x-ray was taken to confirm the level of C5-C6 and C6-C7.,The longus colli muscle was dissected free bilaterally from C5 to C7 using blunt dissection.  Hemostasis was obtained using the electrocautery.  The blades of the cervical retractor were placed deep to the longus colli muscles bilaterally.  At C5-C6, the anterior longitudinal ligament was divided transversely.  Straight pituitary rongeurs and a curette were used to remove the contents of the disc space.  All cartilages were scraped off the inferior endplate of C5 and from the superior endplate of C6.  The disc resection was carried posteriorly to the posterior longitudinal ligament and laterally to the uncovertebral joints.  The posterior longitudinal ligament was resected using a 1 mm Kerrison rongeur.  Beginning in the midline and extending into both neural foramen, posterior osteophytes were removed using a 1 m and a 2 mm Kerrison rongeurs.  The patient was noted to have significant bony spondylosis causing canal and foraminal stenosis as well as a degenerative and protruding disc in agreement with preoperative diagnostic imaging studies.  Following completion of the discectomy and osteophytectomy, a blunt nerve hook was passed into the canal superiorly and inferiorly as well as in the both neural foramen to make sure that there were no extruded disc fragments and to make sure the bony decompression was complete.  A portion of the uncovertebral joint was resected bilaterally for additional nerve root decompression.  Both nerve roots were visualized and noted to be free of encroachment.  The same procedure was then carried out at C6-C7 with similar findings.  The only difference in the findings was that at C6-C7 on the left side, the patient was found to have an extruded disc fragment in the canal and extending into the left side neural foramen causing significant cord and nerve root encroachment.,In preparation for the arthrodesis, the endplates of C5, C6, and C7 were burred in a parallel fashion down to the level of bleeding bone using a high-speed cutting bur with irrigant solution for cooling.  The disc spaces were then measured to the nearest millimeter.  Attention was then turned toward preparation of the structural allograft, which consisted of two pieces of pre-machined corticocancellous bone.  The grafts were further shaped to fit the disc spaces exactly in a press-fit manner with approximately 1.5 mm of distraction at each disc space.  The grafts were shaped to be slightly lordotic to help preserve the cervical lordosis.  The grafts were impacted into the disc spaces.  There was complete bony apposition between the ends of the bone grafts and the vertebral bodies of C5, C6, and C7.  A blunt nerve hook was passed posterior to each bone graft to make sure that the bone grafts were in good position.  Anterior osteophytes were removed using a high-speed cutting bur with irrigant solution for cooling.  An appropriate length Synthes cervical plate was selected and bent slightly to conform to the patient's cervical lordosis.  The plate was held in the midline with provided instrumentation while a temporary fixation screw was applied at C6.  Screw holes were then drilled using the provided drill and drill guide taking care to avoid injury to neurovascular structures.  The plate was then rigidly fixed to the anterior spine using 14-mm cancellous screws followed by locking setscrews added to the head of each screw to prevent postoperative loosening of the plate and/or screws.,An x-ray was taken, which confirmed satisfactory postioning of the plate, screws, and bone grafts.,Blood loss was minimal.  The wound was irrigated with irrigant solution containing antibiotics.  The wound was inspected and judged to be dry.  The wound was closed over a suction drain placed in the deepest portion of the wound by reapproximating the platysma muscle with #4-0 Vicryl running suture, the subdermal and subcuticular layers with #4-0 Monocryl interrupted sutures, and the skin with Steri-Strips.  The sponge and needle count were correct.  A sterile dressing was applied to the wound.  The neck was placed in a cervical orthosis.  The patient tolerated the procedure and was transferred to the recovery room in stable condition.\",\n",

He had a positive stress test and cardiac cath showed severe triple-vessel coronary artery disease including left main disease with preserved LV function.  He was advised surgical revascularization of his coronaries.,FINDINGS DURING THE PROCEDURE:  ,The aorta was free of any significant plaque in the ascending portion at the sites of cannulation and cross clamp.  Left internal mammary artery and saphenous vein grafts were good quality conduits.  Radial artery graft was a smaller sized conduit, otherwise good quality.  All distal targets showed heavy plaque involvement with calcification present.  The smallest target was the PDA, which was about 1.5 mm in size.  All the other targets were about 2 mm in size or greater.  The patient came off cardiopulmonary bypass without any problems.  He was transferred on Neo-Synephrine, nitroglycerin, Precedex drips.  Cross clamp time was 102 minutes, bypass time was 120 minutes.,DETAILS OF THE PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was brought into the operating room and laid supine on the table.  After he had been interfaced with the appropriate monitors, general endotracheal anesthesia was induced and invasive monitoring lines including right IJ triple-lumen catheter and Cordis catheter, right radial A-line, Foley catheter, TEE probes were placed and interfaced appropriately.  The patient was then prepped and draped from chin to bilateral ankles including the left forearm in the usual sterile fashion.  Preoperative checkup of the left forearm has revealed good collateral filling from the ulnar with the radial occluded thus indicating good common arch and thus left radial artery was suitable for harvest.,After prepping and draping the patient from the chin to bilateral ankles including left forearm in the usual sterile fashion, proper time-out was conducted and site identification was performed, and subsequently incision was made overlying the sternum and median sternotomy was performed.  Left internal mammary artery was taken down.  Simultaneously, left forearm radial artery was harvested using endoscopic harvesting techniques.  Simultaneously, endoscopic left leg saphenous vein was harvested using endoscopic minimally invasive techniques.  Subsequent to harvest, the incisions were closed in layers during the course of the procedure.,Heparin was given.  Pericardium was opened and suspended.  During the takedown of the left internal mammary artery, it was noted that the left pleural space was globally softened and left lung was adherent to the chest wall and mediastinum globally.  Only a limited dissection was performed to free up the lung from the mediastinal structures to accommodate the left internal mammary artery.,Pericardium was opened and suspended.  Pursestring sutures were placed.  Aortic and venous as well as antegrade and retrograde cardioplegia cannulation was performed and the patient was placed on cardiopulmonary bypass.  With satisfactory flow, the aorta was cross clamped and the heart was arrested using a combination of antegrade and retrograde cold blood cardioplegia.  An initial dose of about 1500 mL was given and this was followed by intermittent doses given both antegrade and retrograde throughout the procedure to maintain a good arrest and to protect the heart.,PDA was exposed first.  The right coronary artery was calcified along its course all the way to its terminal bifurcation.  Even in the PDA, calcification was noted in a spotty fashion.  Arteriotomy on the PDA was performed in a soft area and 1.5 probe was noted to be accommodated in both directions.  End radial to side PDA anastomosis was constructed using running 7-0 Prolene.  Next, the posterolateral obtuse marginal was exposed.  Arteriotomy was performed.  An end saphenous vein to side obtuse marginal anastomosis was constructed using running 7-0 Prolene.  This graft was then apposed to the diagonal and corresponding arteriotomy and venotomies were performed and a diamond shaped side-to-side anastomosis was constructed using running 7-0 Prolene.  Next, a slit was made in the left side of the pericardium and LIMA was accommodated in the slit on its way to the LAD.  LAD was exposed.  Arteriotomy was performed.  An end LIMA to side LAD anastomosis was constructed using running 7-0 Prolene.  LIMA was tacked down to the epicardium securely utilizing its fascial pedicle.,Two stab incisions were made in the ascending aorta and enlarged using 4-mm punch.  Two proximal anastomosis were constructed between the proximal end of the saphenous vein graft and the side of the aorta, and the proximal end of the radial artery graft and the side of the aorta separately using running 6-0 Prolene.  The patient was given terminal dose of warm retrograde followed by antegrade cardioplegia during which de-airing maneuvers were performed.  Following this, the aortic cross clamp was removed and the heart was noted to resume spontaneous coordinated contractile activity.  Temporary V-pacing wires were placed.  Blake drains were placed in the left chest, the right chest, as well as in the mediastinum.  Left chest Blake drain was placed just in the medial section where dissection had been performed.  After an adequate period of rewarming during which time, temporary V-pacing wires were also placed, the patient was successfully weaned off cardiopulmonary bypass without any problems.  With satisfactory hemodynamics, good LV function on TEE and baseline EKG, heparin was reversed using protamine.  Decannulation was performed after volume resuscitation.  Hemostasis was assured.  Mediastinal and pericardial fat and pericardium were loosely reapproximated in the midline and chest was closed in layers using interrupted stainless steel wires to reappose the two sternal halves, heavy Vicryl for musculofascial closure, and Monocryl for subcuticular skin closure.  Dressings were applied.  The patient was transferred to the ICU in stable condition.  He tolerated the procedure well.  All counts were correct at the termination of the procedure.  Cross clamp time was 102 minutes.  Bypass time was 120 minutes.  The patient was transferred on Neo-Synephrine, nitroglycerin, and Precedex drips.',\n",

He was worked by the neurologist, Dr. X, and found to have cervical spondylosis with myelopathy.  I was consulted and elected to do a lumbar and cervical myelogram CT scan, which showed lumbar stenosis but also cervical stenosis with more pathology anteriorly than posteriorly.  The patient had worst disease at level C3-C4, C4-C5, and C5-C6.  The patient was significantly weak and almost quadriparetic, stronger on the right side than on the left side.  I thought that surgery was indicated to prevent progressive neurological deterioration, as well as to prevent a central cord syndrome if the patient were to get into a motor vehicle accident or simply fall.  Conservative management was not an option.  The patient was preoped and consented, and was medically cleared.  I discussed the indications, risks, and benefits of the surgery with the patient and the patient's family.  The risks of bleeding, hoarseness, swallowing difficulty, pseudoarthrosis as well as plate migration and hardware failure were all discussed with the patient.  An informed consent was obtained from the patient as such.  He was brought into the OR today for the operative procedure.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was brought into the OR, intubated, and given a general anesthetic.  Intubation was done under C-spine precautions.  The patient received preoperative vancomycin and Decadron.  He was hooked up to the SSEP apparatus and had poor baselines and delays.,With a large a shoulder roll, I extended the patient's neck, and landmark incision in crease in the right upper neck, and the area was then prepped and sterilely draped.  All the lines had been put in and the arms were padded.,Using a knife and cautery, I took the incision down through the skin and subcutaneous tissue and arrived at the cervical spine.  Prominent osteophyte at C5-C6 was noted, lesser at C4-C5.  Intraoperative x-ray confirmed our levels, and we were fully exposed from C3-C6.,Trimline retractors were put in, and I cut the discs out as well as removed the superficial hyperstatic bone and osteophytes.,With the drill, I performed a superficial discectomy and endplate resection, curetting the endplate as I went.  I then brought in the microscope, under the microscopic guidance, firmly removed the end plates and drilled through the posterior longitudinal ligament to decompress the spinal cord.  Worst findings at C3-C4 followed C5-C6 and then C4-C5.  Excellent thecal sac decompression was achieved and foraminal decompression was also achieved.  With change in intraoperative monitoring, a microscope was used for this decompressive procedure.,The patient was very oozy throughout this procedure, and during the decompression part, the oozing was constant.  This was partly due to the patient's cancellous bone, but he had been on aspirin which was stopped only 2 days ago, and the option was not available to wait 2 to 3 weeks which would have made this man worse simply over time.  I thus elected to give him DDAVP, platelets, and used Horsley bone wax for excellent hemostasis.  This took literally half-an-hour to an hour and added to the complexity and difficulty of this case.  Eventually, with blood pressure controlled and all the other parameters under control, bleeding was somewhat slow.,I then selected two 10 and one 9-mm cadaveric allograft, which had soaking in bacitracin solution.  These were trimmed to the desired dimensions, and under slight distraction, these were tapped into position.  Excellent graft alignment was achieved.,I now brought in a DePuy titanium eagle plate, and I fixed it to the spine from C3 to C6.  Fourteen millimeter screws were used; all the screws were tightened and torqued.  The patient's bone quality was poor, but the screws did torque appropriately.  I inspected the plate, controlled the hemostasis, assessed post-fixation x-ray, and was really happy with the screw length and the overall alignment.,The wound was irrigated with antibiotic solution; a Jackson-Pratt drain 10-French was put in with trocar.  Decision was made to start the closure.  So, I closed the platysma with 3-0 Vicryl and used staples for the skin.  A simple Primapore or Medpore dressing was applied.  The patient was extubated in the OR and taken to the PSU in stable medical condition.,When I saw the patient in the ICU, he was awake, alert, and moving all four extremities, somewhat weak on the left side.  He had done well from the surgery.  Blood loss was 350 cc.  All instrument, needle, and sponge counts were correct.  No complications, no change in intraoperative monitoring.  No specimens were sent.,The patient's wife was spoken to and fully appraised of the intraoperative findings and the expected prognosis.  The patient will be kept n.p.o. tonight and will gradually advance his diet, and also will gradually advance his activity.  I will keep him on Decadron and keep the collar on.  I do not think there is need for halo rest.  We will be obtaining formal C-spine films in the morning.  Prognosis is guarded but favorable at this time.\",\n",

Airway changes including narrowing of upper lobe segmental bronchi, apical and posterior on the right, and anterior on the left.  There are also changes of inflammation throughout.,PROCEDURE PERFORMED: , Diagnostic fiberoptic bronchoscopy with biopsies and bronchoalveolar lavage.,ANESTHESIA: , Conscious sedation was with Demerol 150 mg and Versed 4 mg IV.,OPERATIVE REPORT: , The patient is residing in the endoscopy suite.  After appropriate anesthesia and sedation, the bronchoscope was advanced transorally due to the patient's recent history of epistaxis.  Topical lidocaine was utilized for anesthesia.  Epiglottis and vocal cords demonstrated some mild asymmetry of the true cords with right true and false vocal cord appearing slightly more prominent.  This may be normal anatomic variant.  The scope was advanced into the trachea.  The main carina was sharp in appearance.  Right upper, middle, and lower segmental bronchi as well as left upper lobe and lower lobe segmental bronchi were serially visualized.  Immediately noted were some abnormalities including circumferential narrowing and probable edema involving the posterior and apical segmental bronchi on the right and to a lesser degree the anterior segmental bronchus on the left.  No specific intrinsic masses were noted.  Under direct visualization, the scope was utilized to lavage the posterior segmental bronchus in the right upper lobe.  Also cytologic brushings and protected bacteriologic brushing specimens were obtained.  Three biopsies were attempted within the cavitary lesion in the posterior segment of the right upper lobe.  During lavage, some caseous appearing debris appeared intermittently.  The specimens were collected and sent to the lab.  Procedure was terminated with hemostasis having been verified.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.,Throughout the procedure, the patient's vital signs and oximetry were monitored and remained within satisfactory limits.,The patient will be returned to her room with orders as per usual.\",\n",
       " 'REASON FOR REFERRAL:,  The patient is a 58-year-old African-American right-handed female with 16 years of education who was referred for a neuropsychological evaluation by Dr. X. She is presenting for a second opinion following a recent neuropsychological evaluation that was ordered by her former place of employment that suggested that she was in the \"early stages of a likely dementia\" and was thereafter terminated from her position as a psychiatric nurse.  A comprehensive evaluation was requested to assess current cognitive functioning and assist with diagnostic decisions and treatment planning.  Note that this evaluation was undertaken as a clinical exam and intended for the purposes of aiding with treatment planning.  The patient was fully informed about the nature of this evaluation and intended use of the results.,RELEVANT BACKGROUND INFORMATION:  ,Historical information was obtained from a review of available medical records and clinical interview with the patient.  A summary of pertinent information is presented below.  Please refer to the patient\\'s medical chart for a more complete history.,HISTORY OF PRESENTING PROBLEM:,  The patient reported that she had worked as a nurse supervisor for Hospital Center for four years.  She was dismissed from this position in September 2009, although she said that she is still under active status technically, but is not able to work.  She continues to receive some compensation through FMLA hours.  She said that she was told that she had three options, to resign, to apply for disability retirement, and she had 90 days to complete the process of disability retirement after which her employers would file for charges in order for her to be dismissed from State Services.  She said that these 90 days are up around the end of November.  She said the reason for her dismissal was performance complaints.  She said that they began \"as soon as she arrived and that these were initially related to problems with her taking too much sick time off secondary to diabetes and fibromyalgia management and at one point she needed to obtain a doctor\\'s note for any days off.  She said that her paperwork was often late and that she received discipline for not disciplining her staff frequently enough for tardiness or missed workdays.  She described it as a very chaotic and hectic work environment in which she was often putting in extra time.  She said that since September 2008 she only took two sick days and was never late to work, but that she continued to receive a lot of negative feedback.,In July of this year, she reportedly received a letter from personnel indicating that she was being referred to a state medical doctor because she was unable to perform her job duties and due to excessive sick time.  Following a brief evaluation with this doctor whose records we do not have, she was sent to a neuropsychologist, Dr. Y, Ph.D.  He completed a Comprehensive Independent Medical Evaluation on 08/14/2009.  She said that on 08/27/2009, she returned to see the original doctor who told her that based on that evaluation she was not able to work anymore.  Please note that we do not have copies of any of her work-related correspondence.  The patient never received a copy of the neuropsychological evaluation because she was told that it was \"too derogatory.\"  A copy of that evaluation was provided directly to this examiner for the purpose of this evaluation.  To summarize, the results indicated \"diagnostically, The patient presents cognitive deficits involving visual working memory, executive functioning, and motor functioning along with low average intellectual functioning that is significantly below her memory functioning and below expectation based on her occupational and academic history.  This suggests that her intellectual functioning has declined.\"  It concluded that \"results overall suggest early stages of a likely dementia or possibly the effects of diabetes, although her deficits are greater than expected for diabetes-related executive functioning problems and peripheral neuropathy…  The patient\\' deficits within the current test battery suggest that she would not be able to safely and effectively perform the duties of a nurse supervisor without help handling documentary demands and some supervision of her visual processing.  The prognosis for improvement is not good, although she might try stimulant medication if compatible with her other.  Following her dismissal, The patient presented to her primary physician, Henry Fein, M.D., who referred her to Dr. X for a second opinion regarding her cognitive deficits.  His neurological examination on 09/23/2009 was unremarkable.  The patient scored 20/30 on the Mini-Mental Status Exam missing one out of three words on recall, but was able to do so with prompting.  A repeat neurocognitive testing was suggested in order to assess for subtle deficits in memory and concentration that were not appreciated on this gross cognitive measure.,IMAGING STUDIES: , MRI of the brain on 09/14/2009 was unremarkable with no evidence of acute intracranial abnormality or abnormal enhancing lesions.  Note that the MRI was done with and without gadolinium contrast.,CURRENT FUNCTIONING:  ,The patient reported that she had experienced some difficulty completing paperwork on time due primarily to the chaoticness of the work environment and the excessive amount of responsibility that was placed upon her.  When asked about changes in cognitive functioning, she denied noticing any decline in problem solving, language, or nonverbal skills.  She also denied any problems with attention and concentration or forgetfulness or memory problems.  She continues to independently perform all activities of daily living.  She is in charge of the household finances, has had no problems paying bills on time, has had no difficulties with driving or accidents, denied any missed appointments and said that no one has provided feedback to her that they have noticed any changes in her cognitive functioning.  She reported that if her children had noticed anything they definitely would have brought it to her attention.  She said that she does not currently have a lawyer and does not intend to return to her previous physician.  She said she has not yet proceeded with the application for disability retirement because she was told that her doctors would have to fill out that paperwork, but they have not claimed that she is disabled and so she is waiting for the doctors at her former workplace to initiate the application.  Other current symptoms include excessive fatigue.  She reported that she was diagnosed with chronic fatigue syndrome in 1991, but generally symptoms are under better control now, but she still has difficulty secondary to fibromyalgia.  She also reported having fallen approximately five times within the past year.  She said that this typically occurs when she is climbing up steps and is usually related to her right foot \"like dragging.\"  Dr. X\\'s physical examination revealed no appreciable focal peripheral deficits on motor or sensory testing and notes that perhaps these falls are associated with some stiffness and pain of her right hip and knee, which are chronic symptoms from her fibromyalgia and osteoarthritis.  She said that she occasionally bumps into objects, but denied noticing it happening one on any particular part of her body.  Muscle pain secondary to fibromyalgia reportedly occurs in her neck and shoulders down both arms and in her left hip.,OTHER MEDICAL HISTORY: , The patient reported that her birth and development were normal.  She denied any significant medical conditions during childhood.  As mentioned, she now has a history of fibromyalgia.  She also experiences some restriction in the range of motion with her right arm.  MRI of the C-spine 04/02/2009 showed a hemangioma versus degenerative changes at C7 vertebral body and bulging annulus with small central disc protrusion at C6-C7.  MRI of the right shoulder on 06/04/2009 showed small partial tear of the distal infraspinatus tendon and prominent tendinopathy of the distal supraspinatus tendon.  As mentioned, she was diagnosed with chronic fatigue syndrome in 1991.  She thought that this may actually represent early symptoms of fibromyalgia and said that symptoms are currently under control.  She also has diabetes, high blood pressure, osteoarthritis, tension headaches, GERD, carpal tunnel disease, cholecystectomy in 1976, and ectopic pregnancy in 1974.  Her previous neuropsychological evaluation referred to an outpatient left neck cystectomy in 2007.  She has some difficulty falling asleep, but currently typically obtains approximately seven to eight hours of sleep per night.  She did report some sleep disruption secondary to unusual dreams and thought that she talked to herself and could sometimes hear herself talking in her sleep.,CURRENT MEDICATIONS:,  NovoLog, insulin pump, metformin, metoprolol, amlodipine, Topamax, Lortab, tramadol, amitriptyline, calcium plus vitamin D, fluoxetine, pantoprazole, Naprosyn, fluticasone propionate, and vitamin C.,SUBSTANCE USE: , The patient reported that she rarely drinks alcohol and she denied smoking or using illicit drugs.  She drinks two to four cups of coffee per day.,SOCIAL HISTORY:  ,The patient was born and raised in North Carolina.  She was the sixth of nine siblings.  Her father was a chef.  He completed third grade and died at 60 due to complications of diabetes.  Her mother is 93 years old.  Her last job was as a janitor.  She completed fourth grade.  She reported that she has no cognitive problems at this time.  Family medical history is significant for diabetes, heart disease, hypertension, thyroid problems, sarcoidosis, and possible multiple sclerosis and depression.  The patient completed a Bachelor of Science in Nursing through State University in 1979.  She denied any history of problems in school such as learning disabilities, attentional problems, difficulty learning to read, failed grades, special help in school or behavioral problems.  She was married for two years.  Her ex-husband died in 1980 from acute pancreatitis secondary to alcohol abuse.  She has two children ages 43 and 30.  Her son whose age is 30 lives nearby and is in consistent contact with her and she is also in frequent contact and has a close relationship with her daughter who lives in New York.  In school, the patient reported obtaining primarily A\\'s and B\\'s.  She said that her strongest subject was math while her worst was spelling, although she reported that her grades were still quite good in spelling.  The patient worked for Hospital Center for four years.  Prior to that, she worked for an outpatient mental health center for 2-1/2 years.  She was reportedly either terminated or laid off and was unsure of the reason for that.  Prior to that, she worked for Walter P. Carter Center reportedly for 21 years.  She has also worked as an OB nurse in the past.  She reported that other than the two instances reported above, she had never been terminated or fired from a job.  In her spare time, the patient enjoys reading, participating in women\\'s groups doing puzzles, playing computer games.,PSYCHIATRIC HISTORY: , The patient reported that she sought psychotherapy on and off between 1991 and 1997 secondary to her chronic fatigue.  She was also taking Prozac during that time.  She then began taking Prozac again when she started working at secondary to stress with the work situation.  She reported a chronic history of mild sadness or depression, which was relatively stable.  When asked about her current psychological experience, she said that she was somewhat sad, but not dwelling on things.

MRI Brain, 10/28/92, revealed multiple areas of abnormally increased signal on T2 weighted images in the white matter regions of the right corpus callosum, periventricular region, brachium pontis and right pons. The appearance of the lesions was felt to be strongly suggestive of multiple sclerosis. 10/28/92, Lumbar puncture revealed the following CSF results: RBC 1, WBC 9 (8 lymphocytes, 1 histiocyte), Glucose 55mg/dl, Protein 46mg/dl (normal 15-45), CSF IgG 7.5mg/dl (normal 0.0-6.2), CSF IgG index 1.3 (normal 0.0-0.7), agarose gel electrophoresis revealed oligoclonal bands in the gamma region which were not seen on the serum sample. Beta-2 microglobulin was unremarkable. An abnormal left tibial somatosensory evoked potential was noted consistent with central conduction slowing. Visual and Brainstem Auditory evoked potentials were normal. HTLV-1 titers were negative. CSF cultures and cytology were negative. She was not treated with medications as her symptoms were primarily sensory and non-debilitating, and she was discharged home.,She returned on 11/7/92 as her symptoms of RUE dysesthesia, lower extremity paresthesia and weakness, all worsened. On 11/6/92, she developed slow slurred speech and had marked difficulty expressing her thoughts. She also began having difficulty emptying her bladder. Her 11/7/92 exam was notable for normal vital signs, lying motionless with eyes open and nodding and rhythmically blinking every few minutes. She was oriented to place and time of day, but not to season, day of the week and she did not know who she was. She had a leftward gaze preference and right lower facial weakness. Her RLE was spastic with sustained ankle clonus. There was dysesthetic sensory perception in the RUE. Jaw jerk and glabellar sign were present.,MRI brain, 11/7/92, revealed multiple enhancing lesions in the peritrigonal region and white matter of the centrum semiovale. The right peritrigonal region is more prominent than on prior study. The left centrum semiovale lesion has less enhancement than previously. Multiple other white matter lesions are demonstrated on the right side, in the posterior limb of the internal capsule, the anterior periventricular white matter, optic radiations and cerebellum. The peritrigonal lesions on both sides have increased in size since the 10/92 MRI. The findings were felt more consistent with demyelinating disease and less likely glioma. Post-viral encephalitis, Rapidly progressive demyelinating disease and tumor were in the differential diagnosis. Lumbar Puncture, 11/8/92, revealed: RBC 2, WBC 12 (12 lymphocytes), Glucose 57, Protein 51 (elevated), cytology and cultures were negative. HIV 1 titer was negative. Urine drug screen, negative. A stereotactic brain biopsy of the right parieto-occipital region was consistent with demyelinating disease. She was treated with Decadron 6mg IV qhours and Cytoxan 0.75gm/m2 (1.25gm). On 12/3/92, she has a focal motor seizure with rhythmic jerking of the LUE, loss of consciousness and rightward eye deviation. EEG revealed diffuse slowing with frequent right-sided sharp discharges.

Nonoperative measures failed to relieve her symptoms and surgical intervention was requested.  We discussed reasonable risks, benefits, and alternatives of various treatment options.  Continuation of nonoperative care versus the risks associated with surgery were discussed.  She understood the risks including bleeding, nerve vessel damage, infection, hoarseness, dysphagia, adjacent segment degeneration, continued worsening pain, failed fusion, and potential need for further surgery.  Despite these risks, she felt that current symptoms will be best managed operatively.,SUMMARY OF SURGERY IN DETAIL: , Following informed consent and preoperative administration of antibiotics, the patient was brought to the operating suite.  General anesthetic was administered.  The patient was placed in the supine position.  All prominences and neurovascular structures were well accommodated.  The patient was noted to have pulse in this position.  Preoperative x-rays revealed appropriate levels for skin incision.  Ten pound inline traction was placed via Gardner-Wells tongs and shoulder roll was placed.  The patient was then prepped and draped in sterile fashion.  Standard oblique incision was made over the C6 vertebral body in the proximal nuchal skin crease.  Subcutaneous tissue was dissected down to the level of the omohyoid which was transected.  Blunt dissection was carried out with the trachea and the esophagus in the midline and the carotid sheath in its vital structures laterally.  This was taken down to the prevertebral fascia which was bluntly split.  Intraoperative x-ray was taken to ensure proper levels.  Longus colli was identified and reflected proximally 3 to 4 mm off the midline bilaterally so that the anterior cervical Trimline retractor could be placed underneath the longus colli, thus placing no new traction on the surrounding vital structures.  Inferior spondylosis was removed with high-speed bur.  A scalpel and curette was used to remove the disc.  Decompression was carried posterior to the posterior longitudinal ligament down to the uncovertebral joints bilaterally.  Disc herniation was removed from the right posterolateral aspect of the interspace.  High-speed bur was used to prepare the endplate down to good bleeding bone and preparation for fusion.  Curette and ball tip dissector was then passed out the foramen and along the ventral aspect of the dura.  No further evidence of compression was identified.  Hemostasis was achieved with thrombin-soaked Gelfoam.  Interspace was then distracted with Caspar pin distractions set gently.  Interspace was then gently retracted with the Caspar pin distraction set.  An 8-mm allograft was deemed in appropriate fit.  This was press fit with demineralized bone matrix and tamped firmly into position achieving excellent interference fit.  The graft was stable to pull-out forces.  Distraction and traction was then removed and anterior cervical instrumentation was completed using a DePuy Trimline anterior cervical plate with 14-mm self-drilling screws.  Plate and screws were then locked to the plate.  Final x-rays revealed proper positioning of the plate, excellent distraction in the disc space, and apposition of the endplates and allograft.  Wounds were copiously irrigated with normal saline.  Omohyoid was approximated with 3-0 Vicryl.  Running 3-0 Vicryl was used to close the platysma.  Subcuticular Monocryl and Steri-Strips were used to close the skin.  A deep drain was placed prior to wound closure.  The patient was then allowed to awake from general anesthetic and was taken to the recovery room in stable condition.  There were no intraoperative complications.  All needle and sponge counts were correct.  Intraoperative neurologic monitoring was used throughout the entirety of the case and was normal.',\n",

He was able to return to work doing more of a light duty type of position.,The injured worker has also seen Dr. Y once again subsequent to the EMG and nerve conduction study on December 3, 2008.  It was felt that the injured worker would benefit from decompression of the carpal tunnel and an ulnar nerve transposition.  The injured worker subsequently was placed in a no work status thereafter.,At the present time, the injured worker does complain of light tingling into the small, ring, and middle finger.  There are times when the whole hand becomes very numb.  He does not use and do any type of lifting with regards to the right hand secondary to the discomfort.  His pain does vary between a 4 on a scale of 1 to 10.  He denies any weakness.  He does not awaken at night with the symptomatology.  Doing his job is the only causation as related to the carpal tunnel syndrome and the cubital tunnel type symptoms.  He does state that he is right-handed.,In addition, he does note numbness and tingling as related to the left hand.  He has not had any type of EMG and nerve conduction study as related to the left upper extremity.,CURRENT MEDICATIONS: , None.,ALLERGIES:,  Zyrtec.,SURGERIES: , Left shoulder surgery.,SOCIAL HISTORY: , The injured worker denies tobacco or alcohol consumption.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,  Healthy-appearing 41-year-old male, who is 5 feet 8 inches, weighs 205 pounds.  He does not appear to be in distress at this time.,On examination of the right upper extremity, one can appreciate no evidence of swelling, discoloration or ecchymosis.  The range of motion of the right wrist reveals flexion is 50 degrees, dorsiflexion 60 degrees, ulnar deviation 30 degrees, radial deviation 20 degrees.  Tinel's and Phalen's tests were positive.  Reverse Phalen's test was negative.  There is diminished sensation in distribution of the thumb, index, middle, and ring finger.  The intrinsic function did appear to be intact.  The injured worker does not demonstrate any evidence of difficulties as related to extension of the middle, ring, and index finger as related to the elbow.  The range of motion of the right elbow reveals flexion 140 degrees, extension 0 degrees, pronation and supination 80 degrees.  Tinel's test is negative as related to the elbow and the ulnar nerve.,There is noted to be satisfactory strength as related to major motor groups of the right upper extremity.,RECORDS REVIEW:  ,1.  First report of injury, difficulty as related to both hands.,2.  Number of notes of Occupational Health Clinic.  It was felt that the injured worker did indeed suffer from median nerve entrapment at the wrist and ulnar nerve entrapment at the right elbow with the associated right lateral epicondylitis.,3.  December 20, 2007, operative note of Dr. Y.  At which time, the injured worker underwent arthroscopic rotator cuff repair, subacromial decompression, partial synovectomy of the anterior compartment, limited debridement of the partial superior-sided subscapularis tear without evidence of subacromial impingement.,4.  November 17, 2008, EMG and nerve conduction study, which demonstrated moderate right median neuropathy plus carpal tunnel syndrome.,ASSESSMENT: , Please state your opinion for the following questions based upon your review of the enclosed medical records on January 23, 2009, examination of the claimant.,Please indicate whether the restriction given on December 3, 2008, is the result of the allowed condition of lateral epicondylitis.,It should be noted on physical examination that the symptomatology as related to the lateral epicondylitis have very much resolved as of January 23, 2009.  Resisted extension of the middle finger and wrist do not cause any pain about the lateral epicondylar region.  It also should be noted that really there is no significant weakness as related to the function of the right upper extremity.  Also noted is there is an absence of tenderness as related to the lateral epicondylar region.,QUESTION:  ,Has the claimant reached maximum medical improvement for the allowed conditions of lateral epicondylitis? Please explain.,ANSWER:  ,Based upon the examination on January 23, 2009, the injured worker has indeed reached maximum medical improvement as related to the diagnosis of lateral epicondylitis.  This is based upon review of the medical records, evidence-based medicine, and the Official Disability Guidelines.,QUESTION:  ,Please indicate whether the allowed condition of lateral epicondylitis has temporarily and totally disabled the claimant from December 8, 2008 through February 1, 2009, and continuing.  Please explain.,ANSWER:  ,There is insufficient medical evidence and it is my opinion to state that the allowed condition of lateral epicondylitis is not temporarily and totally disabling the claimant from December 8, 2008 through February 1, 2009, and continuing.  As mentioned the symptomatology referable to the lateral epicondylar region has very much resolved based upon the examination performed on January 23, 2009.,QUESTION:  ,If it is your opinion that the claimant is temporarily and totally disabled due to allowed condition of lateral epicondylitis, please indicate what treatment the claimant must undergo in order to achieve a plateau of maximum medical improvement.  Please also give an estimated time for maximum medical improvement.,ANSWER:  ,The injured worker has indeed reached maximum medical improvement as related to the elbow.  There is no question that the injured worker is not temporarily and totally disabled due to the allowed condition of lateral epicondylitis.  At the time of the exam, the injured worker has indeed reached maximum medical improvement as related to lateral epicondylitis as described previously.,QUESTION:  ,Is the claimant suffering from carpal tunnel syndrome, right?\",\n",
       " \"HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , The patient is a 55-year-old gentleman who presents for further evaluation of right leg weakness.  He has difficulty recollecting the exact details and chronology of his problem.  To the best of his recollection, he thinks that about six months ago he developed weakness of his right leg.  He describes that he is reaching to get something from a cabinet and he noticed that he was unable to stand on his right toe.  Since that time, he has had difficulty pushing off when he walks.  He has mild tingling and numbness in his toes, but this has been a chronic problem and nothing new since he has developed the weakness.  He has chronic mild back pain, but this has been persistent for many years and has not changed.  He has experienced cramps in both calves for the past year.  This dissipated about two months ago.  He does not think that his left leg is weak.  He does not have any bowel or bladder incontinence.  There is no radicular pain.  He does not think that the problem is progressive, meaning that the weakness that he perceives in his right leg is no different than when it was six months ago.,He first sought medical attention for this problem in October.  He then saw you a couple of months later.  He has undergone an EMG and nerve conduction studies.  Unfortunately, he cannot undergo an MRI of his spine because he has an ear implant.  He has had a CT scan that shows degenerative changes, but nothing obviously abnormal.,In addition, the patient has hyperCKemia.  He tells me that he has had an elevated CK prior to starting taking stat medications, although this is not entirely clear to me.  He thinks that he is not taking Lipitor for about 15 months and thought that his CK was in the 500 or 600s prior to starting it.  Once it was started, it increased to about 800 and then came down to about 500 when it was stopped.  He then had a recent bump again up to the 1000 and since Lipitor has been stopped, his CK apparently has returned to about the 500 or 600s.  I do no have any laboratory data to support these statements by the patient, but he seems to be up to speed on this.  More recently, he has been started taking Zetia.  He does not have any proximal weakness.  He denies any myalgias., ,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:,  He has coronary artery disease and has received five stents.  He has hypertension and hypercholesterolemia.  He states that he was diagnosed with diabetes based on the results of an abnormal oral glucose tolerance test.  He believes that his glucose shot up to over 300 with this testing.  He does not take any medications for this and his blood glucoses are generally normal when he checks it.  He has had plastic surgery on his face from an orbital injury.  He also had an ear graft when he developed an ear infection during his honeymoon., ,CURRENT MEDICATIONS:, He takes amlodipine, Diovan, Zetia, hydrochlorothiazide, Lovaza (fish oil), Niaspan, aspirin, and Chantix.  , ,ALLERGIES:,  He has no known drug allergies., ,SOCIAL HISTORY:,  He lives with his wife.  He works at Shepherd Pratt doing network engineering.  He smokes a pack of cigarettes a day and is working on quitting.  He drinks four alcoholic beverages per night.  Prior to that, he drank significantly more.  He denies illicit drug use.  He was athletic growing up., ,FAMILY HISTORY:,  His mother died of complications from heart disease.  His father died of heart disease in his 40s.  He has two living brothers.  One of them he does not speak too much with and does not know about his medical history.  The other is apparently healthy.  He has one healthy child.  His maternal uncles apparently had polio.  When I asked him to tell me further details about this, he states that one of them had to wear crutches due to severe leg deformans and then the other had leg deformities in only one leg.  He is fairly certain that they had polio.  He is unaware of any other family members with neurological conditions.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: , He has occasional tinnitus.  He has difficulty sleeping.  Otherwise, a complete review of systems was obtained and was negative except for as mentioned above.  This is documented in the handwritten notes from today's visit.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:, ,Vital Signs:\",\n",
       " 'PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: , Nasal fracture and deviated nasal septum with obstruction.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: , Nasal fracture and deviated nasal septum with obstruction.,OPERATION:,  Open reduction, nasal fracture with nasal septoplasty.,ANESTHESIA: , General.,HISTORY: , This 16-year-old male fractured his nose playing basketball.  He has a left nasal obstruction and depressed left nasal bone.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: , The patient was given general endotracheal anesthesia and monitored with pulse oximetry, EKG, and CO2 monitors.,The face was prepped with Betadine soap and solution and draped in a sterile fashion.  Nasal mucosa was decongested using Afrin pledgets as well as 1% Xylocaine, 1:100,000 epinephrine was injected into bilateral nasal septal mucoperichondrium and the nasal dorsum, lateral osteotomy sites.,Inspection revealed caudal portion of the cartilaginous septum lying crosswise across the nasal spine area and columella causing obstruction of the left nasal valve.  Further up, the cartilaginous septum was displaced to the left of the maxillary crest.  There was a large maxillary crest and supramaxillary crest had a large spur with the vomer bone touching the inferior turbinate.,There was a large deep groove horizontally on the right side corresponding to the left maxillary crest.,A left hemitransfixion incision was made.  Mucoperichondrium was elevated from left side of the cartilaginous septum and mucoperiosteum was elevated from the ethmoid plate.  Vomer and inferior tunnel was created at the floor of the left side of the nose to connect the anterior and inferior tunnels, which was rather difficult at the area of the vomerine spur, which was very sharp and touching the inferior turbinate.,The caudal cartilaginous septum, which was lying crosswise, was separated from the main cartilage leaving approximately 1 cm strut.  The right side mucoperichondrium was released from the cartilaginous septum as well as ethmoid plate and the maxillary crest area.,The caudal cartilaginous strut was sutured to the columella with interrupted #4-0 chromic catgut suture to bring it into the midline.,Further back, the cartilaginous septum anterior to the ethmoid plate was deviated to the left side, so it was freed from the maxillary crest, nasal dorsum, from the ethmoid plate, and was sutured in the midline with a transfixion #4-0 plain catgut sutures.,Further posteriorly, the ethmoid plate was deviated to the left side and portion of it was removed with Jansen-Middleton punch forceps.,The main deviation was also caused by the vomerine crest and the maxillary crest and supramaxillary cartilaginous cartilage.,This area was freed from the perichondrium on both sides.  The maxillary crest was removed with a gouge.  Vomer was partially removed with a gouge and the rest of the vomer was displaced back into the midline.,Thus, the deviated septum was corrected.  Left hemitransfixion incisions were closed with interrupted #4-0 chromic catgut sutures.  The septum was also filtered with #4-0 plain catgut sutures.,By valve, septal splints were tied to the septum bilaterally with a transfixion #5-0 nylon suture.,Next, the nasal bone suture deviated to the left side were corrected.  The right nasal bone was depressed and left nasal bone was wide.  Therefore, the nasal bones were refractured back into the midline by compressing the left nasal bone and elevating the right nasal bone with the nasal bone elevator through the nasal cavities.  The left intercartilaginous incision was made and the nasal bones were disimpacted subperiosteally and they were molded back into the midline.,Steri-Strips were applied to the nasal dorsal skin and a Denver type of splint was applied to the nasal dorsal to stabilize the nasal bones.,Nasal cavities were packed with Telfa gauze rolled on both sides with bacitracin ointment.  Approximate blood loss was 10 to 20 mL.',\n",
       " 'OPERATIVE NOTE:  ,The patient was placed in the supine position under general anesthesia, and prepped and draped in the usual manner.  The penis was inspected.  The meatus was inspected and an incision was made in the dorsal portion of the meatus up towards the tip of the penis connecting this with the ventral urethral groove.  This was incised longitudinally and closed transversely with 5-0 chromic catgut sutures.  The meatus was calibrated and accepted the calibrating instrument without difficulty, and there was no stenosis.  An incision was made transversely below the meatus in a circumferential way around the shaft of the penis, bringing up the skin of the penis from the corpora.  The glans was undermined with sharp dissection and hemostasis was obtained with a Bovie.  Using a skin hook, the meatus was elevated ventrally and the glans flaps were reapproximated using 5-0 chromic catgut, creating a new ventral portion of the glans using the flaps of skin.  There was good viability of the skin.  The incision around the base of the penis was performed, separating the foreskin that was going to be removed from the coronal skin.  This was removed and hemostasis was obtained with a Bovie.  0.25% Marcaine was infiltrated at the base of the penis for post-op pain relief, and the coronal and penile skin was reanastomosed using 4-0 chromic catgut.  At the conclusion of the procedure, Vaseline gauze was wrapped around the penis.  There was good hemostasis and the patient was sent to the recovery room in stable condition.',\n",
       " \"REASON FOR CONSULTATION:,  New diagnosis of non-small cell lung cancer.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , ABCD is a very nice 47-year-old gentleman without much past medical history who has now been diagnosed with a new non-small cell lung cancer stage IV metastatic disease.  We are consulted at this time to discuss further treatment options.,ABCD and his wife state that his history goes back to approximately 2-2-1/2 weeks ago when he developed some left-sided flank pain.  Initially, he did not think much of this and tried to go about doing work and everything else but the pain gradually worsened.  Eventually this prompted him to present to the emergency room.  A CT scan was done there, and he was found to have a large left adrenal mass worrisome for metastatic disease.  At that point, he was transferred to XYZ Hospital for further evaluation.  On admission on 12/19/08, a CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis was done for full staging purposes.  The CT scan of the chest showed an abnormal soft tissue mass in the right paratracheal region, extending into the precarinal region, the subcarinal region, and the right hilum.  This was causing some compression on the inferior aspect of the SVC and also some narrowing of the right upper lobe pulmonary artery.  There was an abnormal lymph node noted in the AP window and left hilar region.  There was another spiculated mass within the right upper lobe measuring 2.0 x 1.5 cm.  There was also an 8 mm non-calcified nodule noted in the posterior-inferior aspect of the left upper lobe suspicious for metastatic disease.  There were areas of atelectasis particularly in the right base.  There was also some mild ground glass opacity within the right upper lobe adjacent to the right hilum potentially representing focal area of pulmonary edema versus small infarction related to the right upper lobe pulmonary artery narrowing.  There was a small lucency adjacent to the medial aspect of the left upper lobe compatible with a small pneumothorax.  In the abdomen, there was a mass involved in the left adrenal gland as well as a nodule involving the right adrenal gland both of which appeared necrotic compatible with metastatic tumor.  All other structures appeared normal.  On 12/22/08, a CT-guided biopsy of the left adrenal mass was performed.  Pathology from this returned showing metastatic poorly differentiated non-small cell carcinoma.  At this point, we have been consulted to discuss further treatment options.,On further review, ABCD states that he has may be had a 20 pound weight loss over the last couple of months which he relates to anorexia or decreased appetite.  He has not ever had a chronic smoker's cough and still does not have a cough.  He has no sputum production or hemoptysis.  He and his wife are very anxious about this diagnosis.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: , He denies any history of heart disease, lung disease, kidney disease, liver disease, hepatitis major infection, seizure disorders or other problems.,PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: , He denies having any surgeries.,ALLERGIES: , No known drug allergies.,MEDICATIONS:,  At home he takes no medication except occasional aspirin or ibuprofen, recently for his flank pain.

He has 2+ deep tendon reflexes bilaterally in the biceps, triceps, brachioradialis, patellar and ankle reflexes.  He is alert and oriented x3.,LABORATORY DATA: , His white blood cell count is 9.4, hemoglobin 13.0, hematocrit 38%, and platelets 365,000.  The differential shows 73% neutrophils, 17% lymphocytes, 7.6% monocytes, 1.9% eosinophils, and 0.7% basophils.  Chemistry shows sodium 138, potassium 3.8, chloride 104, CO2 of 31, BUN 9, creatinine 1.0, glucose 104, calcium 12.3, alkaline phosphatase 104, AST 16, ALT 12, total protein 7.6, albumin 3.5, total bilirubin 0.5, ionized calcium 1.7.  His INR is 1.0 with the PT of 11.4 and a PTT of 31.3.,IMAGINING DATA:,  MRI of the brain on 12/23/08 - this shows some mild white matter disease, question of minimal pontine ischemic gliosis as well as a small incidental venous angioma in the left posterior frontal deep white matter.  There is no evidence of cerebral metastasis, hemorrhage, or acute infarction.,ASSESSMENT/PLAN: , ABCD is a very nice 47-year-old gentleman without much past medical history, who now presents with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer.  At this point, he and his wife ask about whether this is curable disease and it was difficult to inform that this was not curable disease but would be treatable.  His wife particularly had a very hard time with this prognosis.  They preferred not to know the exact average as to how long someone lives with this disease.  I did offer chemotherapy as a way to treat this disease.  Chemotherapy has been associated both with palliation of symptoms as well as prolong survival.  At this point, he has an excellent functional status and I think he would tolerate chemotherapy quite well.,In terms of chemotherapy, I talked briefly about the side affects including but not limited to GI upset, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, mucositis, fatigue, loss of appetite, low blood counts including the possible need for transfusion as well as the risk of infections, which in some rare cases can be fatal.  I would likely use carboplatin and gemcitabine.  This would be both medications given on day 1 with a dose of gemcitabine on day 8.  This cycle will be repeated after 1-week break so that the cycle lasts 21 days.  The goal will be to complete 6 cycles of this as long as he is responding and tolerating the medication.,In terms of staging Mr. ABCD'S had all the appropriate staging.  A PET-CT scan could be done, but at this point would not provide much mean full information beyond the CT scans that we have.,At this point, his biggest issue is pain and he is getting a pain consult to help control his pain.  He will be ready to be discharged from the hospital once his pain is under better control.  As this is the holiday weekend, I do not have a way of scheduling a followup appointment with them, but I did give he and his wife my card and instructed them to call on Monday.  At that point, we will get him in and I will also begin working on making arrangements for his chemotherapy.,Thank you very much for this interesting consult.\",\n",

       " 'REASON FOR REFERRAL: , The patient was referred to me by Dr. X of the Hospitalist Service at Children\\'s Hospital due to a recent admission for pseudoseizures.  This was a 90-minute initial intake completed on 10/19/2007 with the patient\\'s mother.  I have reviewed with her the boundaries of confidentiality and the treatment consent form, and she stated that she had understood these concepts.,PRESENTING PROBLEM: , It is reported that the patient was recently hospitalized and has been hospitalized in 2 occasions for pseudoseizure activity.  These were confirmed by video EEG and consist of trembling, shaking, and things of that nature.  She does have a history of focal seizures and perhaps simple seizures, which were diagnosed when she was 5 years old, but the seizure activity that was documented during the hospital stay is of a significant different quality.  I had met with them in the hospital and introduced myself and gathered some basic background information, but this is a supplement to that information, which is contained within this chart.  It was reported to me that she has been under considerable stress.  First of all, it should be noted that the patient is developmentally delayed.  Although she is 17 years old, she operates at about a fourth grade level.  Mother reported that The patient becomes stressed because she thinks that everyone is against her, that she cannot do anything unless someone is there, that she needs a lot of direction, that she gets confused easily, that she thinks that people become angry at her, that she misinterprets what people are saying and thinks that they are upset.  It is reported, the patient feels that her mother yells at her, and that is mad at her often.  It was reported that in addition she recently has had change in her visitation with her father, that she within the last 6 months, has started seeing her father every other weekend after he had been discharged from prison.  She reported that what is stress for her is that sometimes he does not always show up for visits or is late and that upsets her a lot and that she is upset when she has to leave him, also additional stressor is at school.  She reports that she has no friends that she feels unwanted and picked on.  She gets confused easily at school, worries about things, and believes that the teachers become angry with her.  In regards to her mood, mother reported that she is usually happy, unless things do not go her way, and then, she becomes upset and says that nobody cares about her.  She sits in the couch, she become angry, does not speak.  Mother sends her to her room, and she calms down, takes a couple of deep breaths, and that passes.  It is reported that the patient has \"always been this way\" and that is not a change in her behavior.  Mother did think that she did seem a little more depressed, that she seems more lonely.  Over the last few months, she has seemed a little bit more down because she does not have any friends and that she is bored.  Mother reported that she frequently complains of being bored, but has always been this way.  No sleep disturbance was noted.  No changes in weight.  No suicidal ideation.  No deficits in energy were noted.  Mother did report that she does tend to worry, but her worries tend to be because she gets confused, does not understand what she needs to do, and is quite rigid, but mother did not feel that the worry was actually affecting her functioning on a daily basis.,DEVELOPMENTAL HISTORY:,  The patient was the 5 pound 12 ounce product of an unplanned pregnancy and normal spontaneous vaginal delivery.  She was delivered at 36 weeks\\' gestation.  Mother reported that she received prenatal care.  Difficulties during the pregnancy were denied.  The use of drugs, alcohol, tobacco during the pregnancy were denied.  No eating or sleeping difficulties during the perinatal period were reported.  Temperament was described as easy.  The patient is described as a cuddly baby.  In terms of serious injuries, they were denied.  Serious illnesses:  She has been diagnosed since age 5 with seizures.  Mother was not able to tell me the exact kind of seizures, but it would appear from I could gather that they are focal seizures and possibly simple-to-complex partial seizures.  The patient does not have a history of allergy or toileting problems.  She is currently taking Trileptal 450 mg b.i.d., and she is currently taking Depakote, although she is going to be weaned off the Depakote by her neurologist.  She is taking Prevacid and ibuprofen.  The neurologist that she sees is Dr. Y here at Children\\'s Hospital.,FAMILY BACKGROUND:,  In terms of family background, the patient lives with her mother age 38 and her mother\\'s partner, who is age 40, and with her 16-year-old sister who does not have any developmental delays.  Mother had been married to the patient\\'s father, but they were together as a couple beginning 1990, married in 1997, separated in 2002, and divorced in 2003; he lives in the ABC area and visits them every other Saturday, but there are no overnight visits.  The paternal grandparents are both living here in California, but are separated.  They are 3 paternal uncles and 2 paternal aunts.  In terms of the maternal family, maternal grandmother and grandfather are deceased.  Maternal grandfather deceased in 1991 due to cancer.  Maternal grandmother deceased in 2001 due to cancer.  There are 5 maternal aunts and 2 maternal uncles, all who live in California.  She reported that the patient is particularly close to her maternal aunt, whose name is Carmen.  Mother\\'s partner had been married previously; he has 2 children from that relationship, a 23-year-old, and a 20-year-old female, who really are not part of the patient\\'s daily life.  In terms of other family background, it was reported that the mother\\'s partner gets frustrated with The patient, does not completely understand the degree of her delay and how that may affect her ability to do things as well as her interpretation of things.  The sister was described as having some resentment towards her older sister, that she feels like she was just to watch out for her, care for her, and that sister has always wanted to follow her around and do the things that she does.  The biological father allegedly was in jail for a year due to drug possession.  Mother reported that he had a problem with methamphetamine.  In addition, she reported there is an accusation that he had molested their niece; however, she stated that there was a trial, and he was found to be not guilty of that.  She stated there was no evidence that he had ever molested the patient or her sister.  There had been quite a bit of chaos in the family when the mother and father were together.  There was a lot of arguing.  There were a lot of moves, there was domestic violence both from father to mother and mother to father consisting mostly of pushing and shoving by mother\\'s report.  The patient did observe this.  After the separation, it was reported that there were continued difficulties that the father took the patient and her sister from school without mother\\'s knowledge and had filed to get custody of them and actually ended up having custody of them for a month, and told the patient and her sister that the mother had abandoned them.

In terms of current, mother reports that she currently works 2 jobs from 8 to 5 on Monday and Friday and from 6 to 10 on Monday, Wednesday\\'s, and Friday\\'s, but she does have the weekends off.  The patient was reported also to have a job through her school on several weeknights.,Mother reported that she graduated from high school, had a year of college.  She was an average student, had learning difficulties in reading.  No psychological or drug or alcohol history was reported by mother.  In terms of the biological father, mother stated that he graduated from high school, had a couple of years of college, was a good student, no learning problems or psychological problems for him were reported.  Mother reported that he had a history of methamphetamine use.,Other psychiatric history in the family was denied.,SOCIAL HISTORY: , She reported that the patient feels like she does not have any friends, that she is lonely and bored, really does not do much for fun.  Her fun consists primarily of doing crafts with mother, sewing, painting, drawing, beadwork, and things like that.  It was reported that she really feels that she is bored and does not have much to do.,ACADEMIC BACKGROUND:  ,The patient is in the 11th grade at High School.  She has 2 regular education classes, mother could not tell me what they were, but the rest of her classes are special education.  Mother could not tell me what her IQ was, although she noticed she works at about a 4th or 5th grade level.  Mother reported that the terminology most often used with the patient was developmental delay.  Her counselor\\'s name is Mr. XYZ, but she reported that overall she is a good student, but she does have sometimes some difficulties at school, becoming upset or angry regarding the little things that she does not seem to understand.  It is reported that the patient feels that she has no friends at school that she is lonely, and that is she does not really care for school.  She reported that the patient is involved in a work program through the school where she works at Pet Extreme on Mondays and Wednesdays from 3 to 8 p.m. where she stocks shelves.  It is reported that she does not like to go to school because she feels like nobody likes her.  She is not involved in any kind of clubs or groups at school.  Mother reported that she is also not receiving CVRC services.,PREVIOUS COUNSELING: , Mother reported that she has been in counseling before, but mother could not give me any information about that, who did the counseling, or what it was about.  She does receive evidently some peer counseling at school because she gets upset and needs help in calming down.,DIAGNOSTIC SUMMARY AND IMPRESSION:,  It appears that the patient best qualifies for a diagnosis of conversion disorder, and information from Neurology suggests that the \"seizure episodes\" are not true seizures, but appear to be pseudoseizures.  The patient is experiencing quite bit of stress with a lot of changes in her life, also difficulty in functioning likely due to her developmental delay makes it difficult for her to understand.,PLAN:,  My plan is to meet with the patient in approximately 1 to 2 weeks to complete a clinical interview with her, and then to begin teaching coping skills as well as explore ways for reducing her stress.,DSM IV DIAGNOSES:  ,AXIS I:  Conversion disorder (300.11).,AXIS II:  Diagnoses deferred.,AXIS III:  Seizure disorder.,AXIS IV:  Problems with primary support group, peer problems, and educational problems.,AXIS V:  Global assessment of functioning equals 60.',\n",

He was found to have a new tumor last fall, and cystoscopy in November showed Ta papillary-appearing lesion inside the bladder neck anteriorly.  The patient had coronary artery disease and required revascularization, which occurred at the end of December prior to the tumor resection.  He is fully recovered and cleared by Cardiology and taken to the operating room at this time for TURBT.,FINDINGS: , Cystoscopy of the anterior and posterior urethra was within normal limits.  From 12 o'clock to 4 o'clock inside the bladder neck, there was a papillary tumor with some associated blood clot.  This was completely resected.  There was an abnormal dysplastic area in the left lateral wall that was biopsied, and the remainder of the bladder mucosa appeared normal.  The ureteral orifices were in the orthotopic location.  Prostate was 15 g and benign on rectal examination, and there was no induration of the bladder.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , The patient was brought to the cystoscopy suite, and after adequate general laryngeal mask anesthesia obtained, placed in the dorsal lithotomy position and his perineum and genitalia were sterilely prepped and draped in usual fashion.  He had been given oral ciprofloxacin for prophylaxis.  Rectal bimanual examination was performed with the findings described.  Cystourethroscopy was performed with a #23-French ACMI panendoscope and 70-degree lens with the findings described.  A barbotage urine was obtained for cytology.  The cystoscope was removed and a #24-French continuous flow resectoscope sheath was introduced over visual obturator and cold cup biopsy forceps introduced.  Several biopsies were taken from the tumor and sent to the tumor bank.  I then introduced the Iglesias resectoscope element and resected all the exophytic tumor and the lamina propria.  Because of the Ta appearance, I did not intentionally dissect deeper into the muscle.  Complete hemostasis was obtained.  All the chips were removed with an Ellik evacuator.  Using the cold cup biopsy forceps, biopsy was taken from the dysplastic area in the left bladder and hemostasis achieved.  The irrigant was clear.  At the conclusion of the procedure, the resectoscope was removed and a #24-French Foley catheter was placed for efflux of clear irrigant.  The patient was then returned to the supine position, awakened, extubated, and taken on a stretcher to the recovery room in satisfactory condition.\",\n",

End-stage liver disease.,HISTORY AND HOSPITAL COURSE:  ,The patient was admitted after undergoing a drawn out process with a small bowel obstruction.  His bowel function started to improve.  He was on TPN prior to coming to Hospital.  He has remained on TPN throughout his time here, but his appetite and his p.o. intake have improved some.  The patient had an episode while here where his blood pressure bottomed out requiring him to spend multiple days in the Intensive Care Unit on dopamine.  At one point, we were unsuccessful at weaning him off the dopamine, but after approximately 11 days, he finally started to tolerate weaning parameters, was successfully removed from dopamine, and has maintained his blood pressure without difficulty.  The patient also was requiring BiPAP to help with his oxygenation and it appeared that he developed a left-sided pneumonia.  This has been treated successfully with Zyvox and Levaquin and Diflucan.  He seems to be currently doing much better.  He is only using BiPAP in the evening.  As stated above, he is eating better.  He had some evidence of redness and exquisite swelling around his genital and lower abdominal region.  This may be mainly dependent edema versus anasarca.  The patient has been diuresed aggressively over the last 4 to 5 days, and this seems to have made some improvement in his swelling.  This morning, the patient denies any acute distress.  He states he is feeling good and understands that he is being discharged to another facility for continued care and rehabilitation.  He will be discharged to Garden Court skilled nursing facility.,DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS/INSTRUCTIONS:,  He is going to be going with Protonix 40 mg daily, metoclopramide 10 mg every 6 hours, Zyvox 600 mg daily for 5 days, Diflucan 150 mg p.o. daily for 3 days, Bumex 2 mg p.o. daily, Megace 400 mg p.o. b.i.d., Ensure 1 can t.i.d. with meals, and MiraLax 17 gm p.o. daily.  The patient is going to require physical therapy to help with assistance in strength training.  He is also going to need respiratory care to work with his BiPAP.  His initial settings are at a rate of 20, pressure support of 12, PEEP of 6, FIO2 of 40%.  The patient will need a sleep study, which the nursing home will be able to set up.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,VITAL SIGNS:  On the day of discharge, heart rate 99, respiratory rate 20, blood pressure 102/59, temperature 98.2, O2 sat 97%.,GENERAL:  A well-developed white male who appears in no apparent distress.,HEENT:  Unremarkable.,CARDIOVASCULAR:  Positive S1, S2 without murmur, rubs, or gallops.,LUNGS:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally without wheezes or crackles.,ABDOMEN:  Positive for bowel sounds.  Soft, nondistended.  He does have some generalized redness around his abdominal region and groin.  This does appear improved compared to presentation last week.  The swelling in this area also appears improved.,EXTREMITIES:  Show no clubbing or cyanosis.  He does have some lower extremity edema, 2+ distal pedal pulses are present.,NEUROLOGIC:  The patient is alert and oriented to person and place.  He is alert and aware of surroundings.  We have not had any difficulties with confusion here lately.,MUSCULOSKELETAL:  The patient moves all extremities without difficulty.  He is just weak in general.,LABORATORY DATA: , Lab work done today shows the following:  White count 4.2, hemoglobin 10.2, hematocrit 30.6, and platelet count 184,000.

The patient is also ventilator-dependent, respiratory failure with tracheostomy in place and dependent on parenteral nutrition secondary to dysphagia and also has history of protein-calorie malnutrition and the patient needs to receive total parenteral nutrition and therefore needs central venous access.,PROCEDURE:,  The patient's legal guardian was talked to.  All questions were answered and consent was obtained.  The patient was sterilely prepped and draped.  Approximately 4 cc of 1% lidocaine was injected into the inguinal site.  A strong femoral artery pulse was felt and triple lumen catheter Angiocath was inserted at 30-degree angle cephalad and aspirated until a dark venous blood was aspirated.  A guidewire was then placed through the needle.  The needle was then removed.  The skin was ________ at the base of the wire and a dilator was placed over the wire.  The triple lumen catheters were then flushed with bacteriostatic saline.  The dilator was then removed from the guidewire and a triple lumen catheter was then inserted over the guidewire with the guidewire held at all times.,The wire was then carefully removed.  Each port of the lumen catheter was aspirated with 10 cc syringe with normal saline till dark red blood was expressed and then flushed with bacteriostatic normal saline and repeated on the remaining two ports.  Each port was closed off and also kept off.  Straight needle suture was then used to suture the triple lumen catheter down to the skin.  Peristatic agent was then placed at the site of the lumen catheter insertion and a Tegaderm was then placed over the site.  The surgical site was then sterilely cleaned.  The patient tolerated the full procedure well.  There were no complications.  The nurse was then contacted to allow for access of the triple lumen catheter.\",\n",

The patient was then prepped and draped using standard procedure.  An additional drop of tetracaine was instilled in the eye, and then a lid speculum was inserted.,The eye was rotated downward and a crescent blade used to make an incision at the limbus.  This was then dissected forward approximately 1 mm, and then a keratome was used to enter the anterior chamber.  The anterior chamber was filled with 1% preservative-free lidocaine and the lidocaine was then replaced with Provisc.  A cystotome was used to make a continuous-tear capsulorrhexis, and then the capsular flap was removed with the Utrata forceps.  The lens nucleus was hydrodissected using BSS on a cannula and then removed using the phaco.  This was aided by cracking the lens nucleus with McPherson forceps.  The remaining cortex was removed from the eye with the I&A.  The capsular bag was then polished with the I&A on capsular bag.  The bag was inflated using viscoelastic and then the wound extended slightly with a keratome.  A folding posterior chamber lens was inserted and rotated into position using McPherson forceps.  The I&A was then placed in the eye again and the remaining viscoelastic removed.  The wound was checked for watertightness and found to be watertight.

Left hip arthroscopic labral repair.,ANESTHESIA: , General.,OPERATION IN DETAIL: , The patient was taken to the operating room, where he underwent general anesthetic.  His bilateral lower extremities were placed under traction on the Hana table.  His right leg was placed first.  The traction post was left line, and the left leg was placed in traction.  Sterile Hibiclens and alcohol prep and drape were then undertaken.  A fluoroscopic localization was undertaken.  Gentle traction was applied.  Narrow arthrographic effect was obtained.  Following this, the ProTrac portal was made under the fluoro visualization, and then, a direct anterolateral portal made and a femoral neck portal made under direct visualization.  The diagnostic arthroscopy showed the articular surface to be intact with a moderate anterior lip articular cartilage delamination injury that propagated into the acetabulum.  For this reason, the acetabular articular cartilage was taken down and stabilized.  This necessitated takedown of the anterior lip of the acetabulum and subsequent acetabular osteoplasty debridement with associated labral repair.  The labrum was repaired using absorbable Smith & Nephew anchors with a sliding SMC knot.  After stabilization of the labrum and the acetabulum, the ligamentum teres was assessed and noted to be stable.  The remnant articular surface of the femoral artery and acetabulum was stable.  The posterior leg was stable.  The traction was left half off, and the anterolateral aspect of the head and neck junction was identified.  A stable femoral neck decompression was accomplished starting laterally and proceeding anteriorly.  This terminated with the hip coming out of traction and indeterminable flexion.  A combination of burs and shavers was utilized to perform a stable femoral neck osteoplasty decompression.  The decompression was completed with thorough irrigation of the hip.  The cannula was removed, and the portals were closed using interrupted nylon.  The patient was placed into a sterile bandage and anesthetized intraarticularly with 10 mL of ropivacaine subcutaneously with 20 mL of ropivacaine and at this point was taken to the recovery room.

He sustained a blunt trauma to his ribs resulting in multiple fractures and presumably also struck his mandible resulting in the above-mentioned fracture.  He was admitted to hospital in Harleton, Texas, where his initial evaluation showed the rib fractures have also showed a nodule on his right upper lobe as well as a mediastinal mass.  His mandible fracture was not noted initially.  The patient also has a history of prostate cancer and a renal cell carcinoma.  The patient at that point underwent a bronchoscopy with a biopsy of the mediastinal mass and the results of that biopsy are still pending.  The patient later saw a local oral surgeon.  He diagnosed his mandible fracture and advised him to seek treatment in Houston.  He presented to my office for evaluation on January 18, 2010, and he was found to have an extremely atrophic mandible with a fracture in the left parasymphysis region involving a failed dental implant, which had been placed approximately 15 years ago.  The patient had significant discomfort and could eat foods and drink fluids with difficulty.  Due to the nature of his fracture and the complex medical history, he was sent to the hospital for admission and following cardiac clearance, he was scheduled for surgery today.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , The patient was taken to the operating room, and placed in a supine position.  Following a nasal intubation and induction of general anesthesia, the surgeon then scrubbed, gowned, and gloved in the normal sterile fashion.  The patient was then prepped and draped in a manner consistent with sterile procedures.  A marking pen was first used to outline the incision in the submental region and it was extended from the left mandibular body to the right mandibular body region, approximately 1.5 cm medial to the inferior border of the mandible.  A 1 mL of lidocaine 1% with 1:100,000 epinephrine was then infiltrated along the incision and then a 15-blade was used to incise through the skin and subcutaneous tissue.  A combination of sharp and blunt dissection was then used to carry the dissection superiorly to the inferior border of the mandible.  Electrocautery as well as 4.0 silk ties were used for hemostasis.  A 15-blade was then used to incise the periosteum along the inferior border of the mandible and it was reflected exposing the mandible as well as the fracture site.  The fracture site was slightly distracted allowing access to the dental implant within the bone and it was easily removed from the wound.  Cultures of this site were also obtained and then the granulation tissue from the wound was also curetted free of the wound and sent for a histologic diagnosis.  Manipulation of the mandible was then used to achieve an anatomic reduction and then an 11-hole Synthes reconstruction plate was then used to stand on the fracture site.  Since there was an area of weakness in the right parasymphysis region, in the location of another dental implant, the bone plate was extended posterior to that site.  When the plate was adapted to the mandible, it was then secured to the bone with 9 screws, each being 2 mm in diameter and each screw was placed bicortically.  All the screws were also locking screws.  Following placement of the screws, there was felt to be excellent stability of the fracture, so the wound was irrigated with a copious amount of normal saline.  The incision was closed in multiple layers with 4.0 Vicryl in the muscular and subcutaneous layers and 5.0 nylon in the skin.  A sterile dressing was then placed over the incision.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and was taken to the recovery room with spontaneous respirations and stable vital signs.  Estimated blood loss is 125 mL.',\n",

General LMA anesthesia was administered.  She is prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  She was placed in the Trendelenburg position and the left subclavian vein was cannulated and a guide wire placed through the wire.  Fluoroscopy was used to confirm appropriate guide wire location in the subclavian vein to the superior vena cava.  The incision was then made around the guide wire, taken to the subcutaneous tissues with electric Bovie cautery.  A pocket was made in the subcutaneous tissue of adequate size for the port which was cut at 16 cm for appropriate locationing which was cut at 16 cm based on superficial measurements.  The 2-0 Vicryl sutures were used to secure the port in place and the sheath introducer was placed over the guide wire and the guide wire removed with a Port catheter being placed into the sheath introducer.  Fluoroscopy was used to confirm appropriate positioning of the catheter and the skin was closed using interrupted 3-0 Vicryl followed by running 4-0 Vicryl subcuticular stitch.

His left back was prepped and draped in the usual fashion.  Xylocaine 1% was used to infiltrate his chest wall and the chest entered upon the ninth intercostal space in the midscapular line and the thoracentesis catheter was used and placed, and then we proceed to draw by hand about 1200 mL blood.  This blood was nonclotting and it was tested twice.  Halfway during the procedure, the patient felt that he was getting dizzy and his pressure at that time had dropped to the 80s.  Therefore, we laid him off his right side while keeping the chest catheter in place.  At that time, I proceeded to continuously draw fluids slowly and then when the patient recovered we sat him up again and we proceed to complete the procedure.,Overall besides the described episode, the patient tolerated the procedure well and afterwards, we took another chest x-ray that showed much improvement in the pleural effusion and at that particular time, with all the history we proceeded to admit the patient for observation and with an idea to obtain a CT in the morning to see whether the patient would need an pigtail intrapleural catheter or not.',\n",

       " \"SCLERAL BUCKLE OPENING,The patient was brought to the operating room and appropriately identified.  General anesthesia was induced by the anesthesiologist.  The patient was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  A lid speculum was used to provide exposure to the right eye.  A 360-degree limbal conjunctival peritomy was created with Westcott scissors.  Curved tenotomy scissors were used to enter each of the intermuscular quadrants.  The inferior rectus muscle was isolated with a muscle hook, freed of its Tenon's attachment and tied with a 2-0 silk suture.  The 3 other rectus muscles were isolated in a similar fashion.

       " 'RICE, stands for the most important elements of treatment for many injuries---rest, ice, compression, and elevation.,REST:,Stop using the injured part as soon as you realize that an injury has taken place. Use crutches to avoid bearing weight on injuries of the foot, ankle, knee, or leg. Use splints for injuries of the hand, wrist, elbow, or arm. Continued exercise or activity could cause further injury, increased pain, or a delay in healing.,ICE:,Ice helps stop bleeding from injured blood vessels and capillaries. Sudden cold causes the small blood vessels to contract. This contraction decreases the amount of blood that can collect around the wound. The more blood that collects, the longer the healing time. Ice can be safely applied in many ways:,*  For injuries to small areas, such as a finger, toe, foot, or wrist, immerse the injured area for 15 to 35 minutes in a bucket of ice water. Use ice cubes to keep the water cold, adding more as the ice cubes dissolve.,*  For injuries to larger areas, use ice packs. Avoid placing the ice directly on the skin. Before applying the ice, place a towel, cloth, or one or two layers of an elasticized compression bandage on the skin to be iced. To make the ice pack, put ice chips or ice cubes in a plastic bag or wrap them in a thin towel. Place the ice pack over the cloth. The pack may sit directly on the injured part, or it may be wrapped in place.,*  Ice the injured area for about 30 minutes.,*  Remove the ice to allow the skin to warm for 15 minutes.,*  Reapply the ice.,*  Repeat the icing and warming cycles for 3 hours. Follow the instructions below for compression and elevation. If pain and swelling persist after 3 hours call our office. You may need to change the icing schedule after the first 3 hours. Regular ice treatment is often discontinued after 24 to 48 hours. At that point, heat is sometimes more comfortable.,COMPRESSION:,Compression decreases swelling by slowing bleeding and limiting the accumulation of blood and plasma near the injured site. Without compression, fluid from adjacent normal tissue seeps into the injured area. To apply compression safely to an injury:,*  Use an elasticized bandage (Ace bandage) for compression, if possible. If you do not have one available, any kind of cloth will suffice for a short time.,*  Wrap the injured part firmly, wrapping over the ice. Begin wrapping below the injury site and extend above the injury site.,*  Be careful not to compress the area so tightly that the blood supply is impaired. Signs of deprivation of the blood supply include pain, numbness, cramping, and blue or dusky nails. Remove the compression bandage immediately if any of theses symptoms appears. Leave the bandage off until all signs of impaired circulation disappear. Then rewrap the area--less tightly this time.,ELEVATION:,Elevating the injured part above the level of the heart is another way to decrease swelling and pain at the injury site. Elevate the iced, compressed area in whatever way is most convenient. Prop an injured leg on a solid object or pillows. Elevate an injured arm by lying down and placing pillows under the arm or on the chest with the arm folded across.',\n",
       " 'HISTORY: , The patient is a 9-year-old born with pulmonary atresia, intact ventricular septum with coronary sinusoids.  He also has VACTERL association with hydrocephalus.  As an infant, he underwent placement of a right modified central shunt.  On 05/26/1999, he underwent placement of a bidirectional Glenn shunt, pulmonary artery angioplasty, takedown of the central shunt, PDA ligation, and placement of a 4 mm left-sided central shunt.  On 08/01/2006, he underwent cardiac catheterization and coil embolization of the central shunt.  A repeat catheterization on 09/25/2001 demonstrated elevated Glenn pressures and significant collateral vessels for which he underwent embolization.  He then underwent repeat catheterization on 11/20/2003 and further embolization of residual collateral vessels.  Blood pressures were found to be 13 mmHg with the pulmonary vascular resistance of 2.6-3.1 Wood units.  On 03/22/2004, he returned to the operating room and underwent successful 20 mm extracardiac Fontan with placement of an 8-mm fenestration and main pulmonary artery ligation.  A repeat catheterization on 09/07/2006, demonstrated mildly elevated Fontan pressures in the context of a widely patent Fontan fenestration and intolerance of Fontan fenestration occlusion.  The patient then followed conservatively since that time.  The patient is undergoing a repeat evaluation to assess his candidacy for a Fontan fenestration occlusion, as well as consideration for a tricuspid valvuloplasty in attempt to relieve right ventricular hypertension and associated membranous ventricular aneurysm protruding into the left ventricular outflow tract.,PROCEDURE:,  After sedation and local Xylocaine anesthesia, the patient was placed under general endotracheal anesthesia, the patient was prepped and draped.  Cardiac catheterization was performed as outlined in the attached continuation sheets.  Vascular entry was by percutaneous technique, and the patient was heparinized.  Monitoring during the procedure included continuous surface ECG, continuous pulse oximetry, and cycled cuff blood pressures, in addition to intravascular pressures.,Using a 7-French sheath, a 6-French wedge catheter was inserted in the right femoral vein and advanced from the inferior vena cava along the Fontan conduit into the main left pulmonary artery, as well as the superior vena cava.  This catheter was then exchanged for a 5-French VS catheter of a distal wire.  Apposition of the right pulmonary artery over, which the wedge catheter was advanced.  The wedge catheter could then be easily advanced across the Fontan fenestration into the right atrium and guidewire manipulation allowed access across the atrial septal defect to the pulmonary veins, left atrium, and left ventricle.,Using a 5-French sheath, a 5-French pigtail catheter was inserted into the right femoral artery and advanced retrograde to the descending aorta, ascending aorta, and left ventricle.  Attempt was then made to cross the tricuspid valve from the right atrium and guidewire persisted to prolapse through the membranous ventricular septum into the left ventricle.  The catheter distal wire position was finally achieved across what appeared to be the posterior aspect of the tricuspid valve, both angiographically as well as equal guidance.  Left ventricular pressure was found to be suprasystemic.  A balloon valvoplasty was performed using a Ranger 4 x 2 cm balloon catheter with no waste at minimal inflation pressure.  Echocardiogram, which showed no significant change in the appearance of a tricuspid valve and persistence of aneurysmal membranous ventricular septum.  Further angioplasty was then performed first utilizing a 6 mm cutting balloon directed through 7-French flexor sheath positioned within the right atrium.  There was a disappearance of a mild waist prior to spontaneous tear of the balloon.  The balloon catheter was then removed in its entirety.,Echocardiogram again demonstrated no change in the appearance of the tricuspid valve.  A final angioplasty was performed utilizing a 80 mm cutting balloon with the disappearance of a distinctive waste.  Echocardiogram; however, demonstrated no change and intact appearing tricuspid valve and no decompression of the right ventricle.  Further attempts to cross tricuspid valve were thus abandoned.  Attention was then directed to a Fontan fenestration.  A balloon occlusion then demonstrated minimal increase in Fontan pressures from 12 mmHg to 15 mmHg.  With less than 10% fall in calculated cardiac index.  The angiogram in the inferior vena cava demonstrated a large fenestration measuring 6.6 mm in diameter with a length of 8 mm.  A 7-French flexor sheath was again advanced cross the fenestration.  A 10-mm Amplatzer muscular ventricular septal defect occluder was loaded on delivery catheter and advanced through the sheath where the distal disk was allowed to be figured in the right atrium.  Entire system was then brought into the fenestration and withdrawal of the sheath allowed reconfiguration of the proximal disk.  Once the stable device configuration was confirmed, device was released from the delivery catheter.  Hemodynamic assessment and the angiograms were then repeated.,Flows were calculated by the Fick technique using an assumed oxygen consumption and contents derived from Radiometer Hemoximeter saturations and hemoglobin capacity.,Angiograms with injection in the right coronary artery, left coronary artery, superior vena cava, inferior vena cava, and right ventricle.,After angiography, two normal-appearing renal collecting systems were visualized.  The catheters and sheaths were removed and topical pressure applied for hemostasis.  The patient was returned to the recovery room in satisfactory condition.  There were no complications.,DISCUSSION: , Oxygen consumption was assumed to be normal.  Mixed venous saturation was low due to systemic arterial desaturation.  There was modest increased saturation of the branch pulmonary arteries due to the presumed aortopulmonary collateral flow.  The right pulmonary veins were fully saturated.  Left pulmonary veins were not entered.  There was a fall in saturation within the left ventricle and descending aorta due to a right to left shunt across the Fontan fenestration.  Mean Fontan pressures were 12 mmHg with a 1 mmHg fall in mean pressure into the distal left pulmonary artery.  Right and left pulmonary capillary wedge pressures were similar to left atrial phasic pressure with an A-wave similar to the normal left ventricular end-diastolic pressure of 11 mmHg.  Left ventricular systolic pressure was normal with at most 5 mmHg systolic gradient pressure pull-back to the ascending aorta.  Phasic ascending and descending aortic pressures were similar and normal.  The calculated systemic flow was normal.  Pulmonary flow was reduced to the QT-QS ratio of 0.7621.  Pulmonary vascular resistance was normal at 1 Wood units.,Angiogram with injection in the right coronary artery demonstrated diminutive coronary with an extensive sinusoidal communication to the rudimentary right ventricle.  The left coronary angiogram showed a left dominant system with a brisk flow to the left anterior descending and left circumflex coronary arteries.  There was communication to the right-sided coronary sinusoidal communication to the rudimentary right ventricle.  Angiogram with injection in the superior vena cava showed patent right bidirectional Glenn shunt with mild narrowing of the proximal right pulmonary artery, as well as the central pulmonary artery, diameter of which was augmented by the Glenn anastomosis and the Fontan anastomosis.  There was symmetric contrast flow to both pulmonary arteries.  A large degree of contrast flowed retrograde into the Fontan and shunting into the right atrium across the fenestration.  There is competitive flow to the upper lobes presumably due to aortopulmonary collateral flow.  The branch pulmonaries appeared mildly hypoplastic.  Levo phase contrast returned into the heart, appeared unobstructed demonstrating good left ventricular contractility.  Angiogram with injection in the Fontan showed a widely patent anastomosis with the inferior vena cava.  Majority of the contrast flowing across the fenestration into the right atrium with a positive flow to the branch pulmonary arteries.,Following the device occlusion of Fontan fenestration, the Fontan and mean pressure increased to 15 mmHg with a 3 mmHg, a mean gradient in the distal left pulmonary artery and no gradient into the right pulmonary artery.  There was an increase in the systemic arterial pressures.  Mixed venous saturation increased from the resting state as with increase in systemic arterial saturation to 95%.  The calculated systemic flow increased slightly from the resting state and pulmonary flow was similar with a QT-QS ratio of 0.921.  Angiogram with injection in the inferior vena cava showed a stable device configuration with a good disk apposition to the anterior surface of the Fontan with no protrusion into the Fontan and no residual shunt and no obstruction to a Fontan flow.  An ascending aortogram that showed a left aortic arch with trace aortic insufficiency and multiple small residual aortopulmonary collateral vessels arising from the intercostal arteries.

The occipital area was shaven bilaterally and then the areas of the prior scalp incisions were infiltrated with 0.25% Marcaine with 1:200,000 epinephrine after routine prepping and draping.  Both U-shaped scalp incisions were opened exposing both the left and the right ventricular catheters as well as the old low pressure reservoir, which might have been leading to the coaptation of the ventricles.  The patient also had a right subtemporal depression, which was full preoperatively.  The entire old apparatus was dissected out.  We then cut both the ventricular catheters and secured them with sutures so that __________ could be inserted.  They were both inspected.  No definite debris were seen.  After removing the ventricular catheters, the old tracts were inspected and we could see where there was coaptation of the ventricles against the ventricular catheter.  On the right side, we elected to insert the Portnoy ventricular catheter and on the left a new Bactiseal catheter was inserted underneath the corpus callosum in a different location.  The old valve was dissected out and the proGAV valve with a 2-0 shunt assist was inserted and secured with a 2-0 Ethibond suture.  The proGAV valve was then connected to a Bactiseal distal tubing, which was looped in a cephalad way and then curved towards the left burr hole site and then the Portnoy catheter on the right was secured with a right-angled sleeve and then interposed between it and the left burr hole site with a flushing reservoir.  All connections secured with 2-0 Ethibond suture and a small piece of Bactiseal tubing between the flushing reservoir and the connector, which secured the left Bactiseal tubing to the two other Bactiseal tubings one being the distal Bactiseal tubing going towards the proGAV valve, which was set to an opening pressure of 8 and the other one being the Bactiseal tubing, which was going towards the flushing reservoir.,All the wounds were irrigated out with bacitracin and then closed in a routine manner using Vicryl for the deep layers and Monocryl for the skin, followed by Mastisol and Steri-Strips.

A guidewire was then threaded through the vein and advanced without difficulty.  An introducer was then placed over the guidewire.  We attempted to manipulate the guidewire to the superior vena cava; however, we could not pass the point of the subclavian vein and we tried several maneuvers and then opted to do a venogram.  What we did was we injected approximately 4 mL of Visipaque 320 contrast material through the introducer and did a mapping venogram and it turned out that the cephalic vein was joining into the subclavian vein.  It was very tortuous area.  We made several more attempts using the mapping system to pass the glide over that area, but we were unable to do that.  Decision was made at that point then to just do a midline catheter.  The catheter was cut to 20 cm, then we inserted back to the introducer.  The introducer was removed.  The catheter was secured by two #3-0 silk sutures.  Appropriate imaging was then taken.  Sterile dressing was applied.

Then the anterior aspect of the neck was prepped and draped in a routine sterile fashion.  A linear skin incision was made in the skin fold line from just to the right of the midline to the leading edge of the right sternocleidomastoid muscle and taken sharply to platysma, which was dissected in a subplatysmal manner, and then the prevertebral space was encountered and prominent anterior osteophytes were well visualized once longus colli muscle was cauterized along its mesial border, and self-retaining retractors were placed to reveal the anterior osteophytic spaces.  Large osteophytes were excised with a rongeur at C4-5, C5-C6, and C6-C7 revealing a collapsed disc space and a #11 blade was utilized to create an annulotomy at all three interspaces with discectomies being performed with straight disc forceps removing grossly degenerated and very degenerated discs at C4-C5, then at C5-C6, then at C6-C7 sending specimen for permanent section to Pathology in a routine and separate manner.  Residual disc fragments were drilled away as drilling extended into normal cortical and cancellous elements in order to perform a wide decompression all the way posteriorly to the spinal canal itself finally revealing a ligament, which was removed in a similar piecemeal fashion with 1 and 2-mm micro Kerrison rongeurs also utilizing these instruments to remove prominent osteophytes, widely laterally bilaterally at each interspace with one at C4-C5, more right-sided.

       " 'PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Critical left carotid stenosis.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Critical left carotid stenosis.,PROCEDURE PERFORMED:,  Left carotid endarterectomy with endovascular patch angioplasty.,ANESTHESIA:,  Cervical block.,GROSS FINDINGS:  ,The patient is a 57-year-old black female with chronic renal failure.  She does have known critical carotid artery stenosis.  She wishes to undergo bilateral carotid endarterectomy, however, it was felt necessary by Dr. X to perform cardiac catheterization.  She was admitted to the hospital yesterday with chest pain.  She has been considered for coronary artery bypass grafting.  I have been asked to address the carotid stenosis, left being more severe, this was addressed first.  Intraoperatively, an atherosclerotic plaque was noted in the common carotid artery extending into the internal carotid artery.  The internal carotid artery is quite torturous.  The external carotid artery was occluded at its origin.  When the endarterectomy was performed, the external carotid artery back-bled nicely.  The internal carotid artery had good backflow bleeding noted.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE: , The patient was taken to the OR suite and placed in the supine position.  Then neck, shoulder, and chest wall were prepped and draped in appropriate manner.  Longitudinal incision was created along the anterior border of the left sternocleidal mastoid muscle and this was taken through the subcutaneous tissue and platysmal muscle utilizing electrocautery.,Utilizing both blunt and sharp dissections, the common carotid artery, the internal carotid artery beyond the atherosclerotic back, the external carotid artery, and the superior thyroid artery were isolated and encircled with a umbilical tape.  During the dissection, facial veins were ligated with #4-0 silk ligature prior to dividing them.  Also during the dissection, ansa cervicalis, hypoglossal, and vagus nerve identified and preserved.  There was some inflammation above the carotid bulb, but this was not problematic.,The patient had been administered 5000 units of aqueous heparin after allowing adequate circulating time.  The internal carotid artery is controlled with Heifitz clip followed by the external carotid artery and the superior thyroid artery being controlled with Heifitz clips.  The common carotid artery was controlled with profunda clamp.  The patient remained neurologically intact.  A longitudinal arteriotomy was created along the posterior lateral border of the common carotid artery.  This was extended across the lobe on to the internal carotid artery.  An endarterectomy was then performed.  The ________ intima was cleared of all debris and the ________ was flushed with copious amounts of heparinized saline.  As mentioned before, the internal carotid artery is quite torturous.  This was shortened by imbricating the internal carotid artery with horizontal mattress stitches of #7-0 Prolene suture.,The wound was copiously irrigated, rather an endovascular patch was then brought on to the field.  This was cut to shape and length.  This was sutured in place with continuous running #6-0 Prolene suture.  The suture line began at both sites.  The suture was tied in the center along the anterior and posterior walls.  Prior to completing the closure, the common carotid artery was flushed.  The internal carotid artery permitted to back bleed.  The clamp was placed after completing the closure.  The clamp was placed at the origin of the internal carotid artery.  Flow was first directed into the external carotid artery then into the internal carotid artery.  The patient remained neurologically intact.  Topical ________ Gelfoam was utilized.  Of note, during the endarterectomy, the patient did receive an additional 7000 units of aqueous heparin.  The wound was copiously irrigated with antibiotic solution.  Sponge, needle, and all counts were correct.  All surgical sites were inspected.  Good hemostasis noted.  The incision was closed in layers with absorbable suture.  Stainless steel staples approximated skin.  Sterile dressings were applied.  The patient tolerated the procedure well, grossly neurologically intact.',\n",

Necrotic testes.,SURGERY:,  Left orchiectomy, scrotal exploration, right orchidopexy.,DRAINS:,  Penrose drain on the left hemiscrotum.,The patient was given vancomycin, Zosyn, and Levaquin preop.,BRIEF HISTORY:  ,The patient is a 49-year-old male who came into the emergency room with 2-week history of left testicular pain, scrotal swelling, elevated white count of 39,000.  The patient had significant scrotal swelling and pain.  Ultrasound revealed necrotic testicle.  Options such as watchful waiting and removal of the testicle were discussed.  Due to elevated white count, the patient was told that he must have the testicle removed due to the infection and possible early signs of urosepsis.  The risks of anesthesia, bleeding, infection, pain, MI, DVT, PE, scrotal issues, other complications were discussed.  The patient was told about the morbidity and mortality of the procedure and wanted to proceed.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , The patient was brought to the OR.  Anesthesia was applied.  The patient was prepped and draped in usual sterile fashion.  A midline scrotal incision was made.  There was very, very thick scrotal skin.  There was no necrotic skin.  As soon as the left hemiscrotum was entered, significant amount of pus poured out of the left hemiscrotum.  The testicle was completely filled with pus and had completely disintegrated with pus.  The pus just poured out of the left testicle.  The left testicle was completely removed.  Debridement was done of the scrotal wall to remove any necrotic tissue.  Over 2 L of antibiotic irrigation solution was used to irrigate the left hemiscrotum.  There was good tissue left after all the irrigation and debridement.  A Penrose drain was placed in the bottom of the left hemiscrotum.  I worried about the patient may have torsed and then the testicle became necrotic, so the plan was to pex the right testicle, plus the right side also appeared very abnormal.  So, the right hemiscrotum was opened.  The testicle had significant amount of swelling and scrotal wall was very thick.  The testicle appeared normal.  There was no pus coming out of the right hemiscrotum.  At this time, a decision was made to place 4-0 Prolene nonabsorbable stitches in 3 different quadrants to prevent it from torsion.  The hemiscrotum was closed using 2-0 Vicryl in interrupted stitches and the skin was closed using 2-0 PDS in horizontal mattress.  There was very minimal pus left behind and the skin was very healthy.  Decision was made to close it to help the patient heal better in the long run.  The patient was brought to the recovery in stable condition.',\n",

Osteophyte lateral femoral condyle, right knee.,PROCEDURES PERFORMED:, Excision of capsular mass and arthrotomy with ostectomy of lateral femoral condyle, right knee.,SPECIFICATION: , The entire operative procedure was done in Inpatient Operating Suite, room #1 at ABCD General Hospital.  This was done under a local and IV sedation via the Anesthesia Department.,HISTORY AND GROSS FINDINGS:,  This is a 37-year-old African-American male with a mass present at the posterolateral aspect of his right knee.  On aspiration, it was originally attempted to no avail.  There was a long-standing history of this including two different MRIs, one about a year ago and one very recently both of which did not delineate the mass present.  During aspiration previously, the patient had experienced neuritic type symptoms down his calf, which have mostly resolved by the time that this had occurred.  The patient continued to complain of pain and dysfunction to his calf.  This was discussed with him at length.  He wished this to be explored and the mass excised even though knowing the possibility that they would not change his pain pattern with the potential of reoccurrence as well as the potential of scar stiffness, swelling, and peroneal nerve palsy.  With this, he decided to proceed.,Upon observation preoperatively, the patient was noted to have a hard mass present to the posterolateral aspect of the right knee.  It was noted to be tender.  It was marked preoperatively prior to an anesthetic.  Upon dissection, the patient was noted to have significant thickening of the posterior capsule.  The posterolateral aspect of the knee above the posterolateral complex at the gastroc attachment to the lateral femoral condyle.  There was also noted to be prominence of the lateral femoral condyle ridge.  The bifurcation at the tibial and peroneal nerves were identified and no neuroma was present.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was laid supine upon the operating table.  After receiving IV sedation, he was placed prone.  Thigh tourniquet was placed.  He was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.  A transverse incision was carried down across the crease with a mass had been palpated through skin and subcutaneous tissue after exsanguination of the limb and tourniquet utilized.  The nerve was identified and carefully retracted throughout the case.  Both nerves were identified and carefully retracted throughout the case.  There was noted to be no neuroma present.  This was taken down until the gastroc was split.  There was gross thickening of the joint capsule and after arthrotomy, a section of the capsule was excised.  The lateral femoral condyle was then osteophied.  We then smoothed off with a rongeur.  After this, we could not palpate any mass whatsoever placing pressure upon the area of the nerve.  Tourniquet was deflated.  It was checked again.  There was no excessive swelling.  Swanson drain was placed to the depth of the wound and interrupted #2-0 Vicryl was utilized for subcutaneous fat closure and #4-0 nylon was utilized for skin closure.  Adaptic, 4x4s, ABDs, and Webril were placed for compression dressing.  Digits were warm _______ pulses distally at the end of the case.  The tourniquet as stated has been deflated prior to closure and hemostasis was controlled.  Expected surgical prognosis on this patient is guarded.',\n",
       " 'REASON FOR REFERRAL:,  The patient is a 76-year-old Caucasian gentleman who works full-time as a tax attorney.  He was referred for a neuropsychological evaluation by Dr. X after a recent hospitalization for possible transient ischemic aphasia.  Two years ago, a similar prolonged confusional spell was reported as well.  A comprehensive evaluation was requested to assess current cognitive functioning and assist with diagnostic decisions and treatment planning.,RELEVANT BACKGROUND INFORMATION: , Historical information was obtained from a review of available medical records and clinical interview with the patient.  A summary of pertinent information is presented below.  Please refer to the patient\\'s medical chart for a more complete history.,HISTORY OF PRESENTING PROBLEM: , The patient was brought to the Hospital Emergency Department on 09/30/09 after experiencing an episode of confusion for which he has no recall the previous day.  He has no recollection of the event.  The following information is obtained from his medical record.  On 09/29/09, he reportedly went to a five-hour meeting and stated several times \"I do not feel well\" and looked \"glazed.\"  He does not remember anything from midmorning until the middle of the night and when his wife came home, she found him in bed at 6 p.m., which is reportedly unusual.  She thought he was warm and had chills.  He later returned to his baseline.  He was seen by Dr. X in the hospital on 09/30/09 and reported to him at that time that he felt that he had returned entirely to baseline.  His neurological exam at that time was unremarkable aside from missing one of three items on recall for the Mini-Mental Status Examination.  Due to mild memory complaints from himself and his wife, he was referred for more extensive neuropsychological testing.  Note that reportedly when his wife found him in bed, he was shaking and feeling nauseated, somewhat clammy and kept saying that he could not remember anything and he was repeating himself, asking the same questions in an agitated way, so she brought him to the emergency room.  The patient had an episode two years ago of transient loss of memory during which he was staring blankly while sitting at his desk at work and the episode lasted approximately two hours.  He was hospitalized at Hospital at that time as well and evaluation included negative EEG, MRI showing mild atrophy, and a neurological consultation, which did not result in a specific diagnosis, but during this episode he was also reportedly nauseous.  He was also reportedly amnestic for this episode.,In 2004, he had a sense of a funny feeling in his neck and electrodes in his head and had an MRI at that time which showed some small vessel changes.,During this interview, the patient reported that other than a coworker noticing a few careless errors in his completion of some documents and his wife reporting some mild memory changes that he had not noticed any significant decline.  He thought that his memory abilities were similar to those of his peers of his same age.  When I asked about this episode, he said he had no recall of it at all and that he \"felt fine the whole time.\"  He appeared to be somewhat questioning of the validity of reports that he was amnestic and confused at that time.  So, The patient reported some age related \"memory lapses\" such as going into a room and forgetting why, sometimes putting something down and forgetting where he had put it.  However, he reported that these were entirely within normal expectations and he denied any type of impairment in his ability to continue to work full-time as a tax attorney other than his wife and one coworker, he had not received any feedback from his children or friends of any problems.  He denied any missed appointments, any difficulty scheduling and maintaining appointments.  He does not have to recheck information for errors.  He is able to complete tasks in the same amount of time as he always has.  He reported that he has not made additional errors in tasks that he completed.  He said he does write everything down, but has always done things that way.  He reported that he works in a position that requires a high level of attentiveness and knowledge and that will become obvious very quickly if he was having difficulties or making mistakes.  He did report some age related changes in attention as well, although very mild and he thought these were normal and not more than he would expect for his age.  He remains completely independent in his ADLs.  He denied any difficulty with driving or maintaining any activities that he had always participated in.  He is also able to handle their finances.  He did report significant stress recently particularly in relation to his work environment.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:,  Includes coronary artery disease, status post CABG in 1991, radical prostate cancer, status post radical prostatectomy, nephrectomy for the same cancer, hypertension, lumbar surgery done twice previously, lumbar stenosis many years ago in the 1960s and 1970s, now followed by Dr. Y with another lumbar surgery scheduled to be done shortly after this evaluation, and hyperlipidemia.  Note that due to back pain, he had been taking Percocet daily prior to his hospitalization.,CURRENT MEDICATIONS: , Celebrex 200 mg, levothyroxine 0.025 mg, Vytorin 10/40 mg, lisinopril 10 mg, Coreg 10 mg, glucosamine with chondroitin, prostate 2.2, aspirin 81 mg, and laxative stimulant or stool softener.  Note that medical records say that he was supposed to be taking Lipitor 40 mg, but it is not clear if he was doing so and also there was no specific reason found for why he was taking the levothyroxine.,OTHER MEDICAL HISTORY: , Surgical history is significant for hernia repair in 2007 as well.  The patient reported drinking an occasional glass of wine approximately two days of the week.  He quit smoking cigarettes 25 to 30 years ago and he was diagnosed with cancer.  He denied any illicit drug use.  Please add that his prostatectomy was done in 1993 and nephrectomy in 1983 for carcinoma.  He also had right carpal tunnel surgery in 2005 and has cholelithiasis.  Upon discharge from the hospital, the patient\\'s sleep deprived EEG was recommended.,MRI completed on 09/30/09 showed \"mild cerebral and cerebellar atrophy with no significant interval change from a prior study dated June 15, 2007.  No evidence of acute intracranial processes identified.  CT scan was also unremarkable showing only mild cerebral and cerebellar atrophy.  EEG was negative.  Deferential diagnosis was transient global amnesia versus possible seizure disorder.  Note that he also reportedly has some hearing changes, but has not followed up with an evaluation for hearing aid.,FAMILY MEDICAL HISTORY:, Reportedly significant for TIAs in his mother, although the patient did not report this during our evaluation and so that she had no memory problems or dementia when she passed away of old age at the age of 85.  In addition, his father had a history of heart disease and passed away at the age of 75.  He has one sister with diabetes and thought his mom might have had diabetes as well.,SOCIAL HISTORY:,  The patient obtained a law degree from the University of Baltimore.  He did not complete his undergraduate degree from the University of Maryland because he was able to transfer his credits in order to attend law school at that time.  He reported that he did not obtain very good grades until he reached law school, at which point he graduated in the top 10 of his class and had no problem passing the Bar.  He thought that effort and motivation were important to his success in his school and he had not felt very motivated previously.  He reported that he repeated math classes \"every year of school\" and attended summer school every year due to that.  He has worked as a tax attorney for the past 48 years and reported having a thriving practice with clients all across the country.  He served also in the U.S.  Coast Guard between 1951 and 1953.  He has been married for the past 36 years to his wife, Linda, who is a homemaker.  They have four children and he reported having good relationship with them.  He described being very active.  He goes for dancing four to five times a week, swims daily, plays golf regularly and spends significant amounts of time socializing with friends.,PSYCHIATRIC HISTORY: , The patient denied any history of psychological or psychiatric treatment.  He reported that some stressors occasionally contribute to mildly low mood at this time, but that these are transient.,TASKS ADMINISTERED:,Clinical Interview,Adult History Questionnaire,Wechsler Test of Adult Reading (WTAR),Mini Mental Status Exam (MMSE),Cognistat Neurobehavioral Cognitive Status Examination,Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS; Form XX),Mattis Dementia Rating Scale, 2nd Edition (DRS-2),Neuropsychological Assessment Battery (NAB),Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, Third Edition (WAIS-III),Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, Fourth Edition (WAIS-IV),Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence (WASI),Test of Variables of Attention (TOVA),Auditory Consonant Trigrams (ACT),Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test (PASAT),Ruff 2 & 7 Selective Attention Test,Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT),Multilingual Aphasia Examination, Second Edition (MAE-II), Token Test, Sentence Repetition, Visual Naming, Controlled Oral Word Association, Spelling Test, Aural Comprehension, Reading Comprehension,Boston Naming Test, Second Edition (BNT-2),Animal Naming Test',\n",

A thoracostomy tube was placed at the bedside with only partial resolution of the pleural effusion.  On CT scan evaluation, there is evidence of an entrapped right lower lobe with loculations.  Decision was made to proceed with surgical intervention for a complete decortication and the patient understands the need for surgery and signed the preoperative informed consent.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE: , The patient was taken to the operative suite and placed in the supine position under general anesthesia per Anesthesia Department.  Intraoperative bronchoscopy was performed by Dr. Y and evaluation of carina, left upper and lower lobes with segmental evidence of diffuse mucous, thick secretions which were thoroughly lavaged with sterile saline lavage.  Samples were obtained from both the left and the right subbronchiole segments for Gram stain cultures and ASP evaluation.  The right bronchus lower, middle, and upper were also examined and subsegmental bronchiole areas were thoroughly examined with no evidence of masses, lesions, or suspicious extrinsic compressions on the bronchi.  At this point, all mucous secretions were thoroughly irrigated and aspirated until the airways were clear.  Bronchoscope was then removed.  Vital signs remained stable throughout this portion of the procedure.  The patient was re-intubated by Anesthesia with a double lumen endotracheal tube.  At this point, the patient was repositioned in the left lateral decubitus position with protection of all pressure points and the table was extended in customary fashion.  At this point, the right chest was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  The chest tube was removed before prepping the patient and the prior thoracostomy site was cleansed thoroughly with Betadine.  The first port was placed through this incision intrathoracically.  A bronchoscope was placed for inspection of the intrathoracic cavity.  Pictures were taken.  There is extensive fibrinous exudate noted under parietal and visceral pleura, encompassing the lung surface, diaphragm, and the posterolateral aspect of the right thorax.  At this point, a second port site anteriorly was placed under direct visualization.  With the aid of the thoracoscopic view, a Yankauer resection device was placed in the thorax and blunt decortication was performed and aspiration of reminder of the pleural fluid.  Due to the gelatinous nature of the fibrinous exudate, there were areas of right upper lobe that adhered to the chest wall and the middle and lower lobes appeared entrapped.  Due to the extensive nature of the disease, decision was made to open the chest in a formal right thoracotomy fashion.  Incision was made.  The subcutaneous tissues were then electrocauterized down to the level of the latissimus dorsi, which was separated with electrocautery down to the anterior 6th rib space.  The chest cavity was entered with the right lung deflated per Anesthesia at our request.  Once the intrathoracic cavity was accessed, a thorough decortication was performed in meticulous systematic fashion starting with the right upper lobe, middle, and the right lower lobe.  With the expansion of the lung and reduction of the pleural surface fibrinous extubate, warm irrigation was used and the lungs allowed to re-expand.  There was no evidence of gross leakage or bleeding at the conclusion of surgery.,Full lung re-expansion was noted upon re-inflation of the lung.  Two #32 French thoracostomy tubes were placed, one anteriorly straight and one posteriorly on the diaphragmatic sulcus.  The chest tubes were secured in place with #0-silk sutures and placed on Pneumovac suction.  Next, the ribs were reapproximated with five interrupted CTX sutures and latissimus dorsi was then reapproximated with a running #2-0 Vicryl suture.  Next, subcutaneous skin was closed sequentially with a cosmetic layered subcutaneous closure.  Steri-Strips were applied along with sterile occlusive dressings.  The patient was awakened from anesthesia without difficulty and extubated in the operating room.  The chest tubes were maintained on Pleur-Evac suction for full re-expansion of the lung.  The patient was transported to the recovery with vital signs stable.  Stat portable chest x-ray is pending.  The patient will be admitted to the Intensive Care Unit for close monitoring overnight.',\n",

The patient was taken to the Cardiac Catheterization Suite where the right femoral region was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  1% lidocaine solution was then used to infiltrate the skin overlying the right femoral artery.  Once adequate anesthesia had been obtained, a thin-walled #18 gauge Argon needle was used to cannulate the right femoral artery.  A steel guidewire was then inserted through the needle into the vascular lumen without resistance.  A small nick was then made in the skin and its pressure was held.  The needle was removed over the guidewire.  A #6 French sheath was then advanced over the guidewire into the vascular lumen without resistance.  The guidewire and dilator were then removed.  The sheath was then flushed.  Next, angulated pigtail catheter was advanced to the level of the ascending aorta under direct fluoroscopic visualization with the use of the guidewire.  The catheter was then advanced into the left ventricle.  The guidewire was then removed.  The catheter was connected to the manifold and flushed.  LVEDP was then measured and found to be favorable for a left ventriculogram.  The left ventriculogram was performed in the RAO position with a single power injection of non-ionic contrast material.  LVEDP was then remeasured.  Pullback was then performed, which failed to reveal an LVAO gradient.  The catheter was then removed.  Next, a Judkins left #4 catheter was advanced to the level of the ascending aorta under direct fluoroscopic visualization with the use of a guidewire.  The guidewire was removed.  The catheter was connected to the manifold and flushed.  Using hand injections of non-ionic contrast material, the left coronary system was evaluated in several different views.  Once adequate study has been performed, the catheter was removed.  Next, a Judkins right #4 catheter was then advanced to the level of the ascending aorta under direct fluoroscopic visualization with the use of a guidewire.  The guidewire was removed.  The catheter was connected to the manifold and flushed.  The ostium of the saphenous vein graft was engaged using hand injections of non-ionic contrast material.  The saphenous vein graft was visualized in several different views.  The Judkins right catheter was then advanced and the native coronary artery was engaged using hand injections of non-ionic contrast material.  Right coronary system was evaluated in several different views.  Once adequate study has been performed, the catheter was retracted.  We were unable to engage the left subclavian artery thus the catheter was removed over an exchange wire.  Next, a multipurpose catheter was advanced over the exchange wire.  The wire was then easily passed into the left subclavian artery.  The multipurpose catheter was then removed.  LIMA catheter was then exchanged over the wire into the left subclavian artery.  The guidewire was removed and the catheter was connected to the manifold and flushed.  LIMA graft was then engaged using hand injections of non-ionic contrast material.  The LIMA graft was evaluated in several different views.  Once adequate study has been performed, the LIMA catheter was retracted under fluoroscopic guidance.  The sheath was flushed for the final time.  The patient was returned to the cardiac catheterization holding area in stable and satisfactory condition.,FINDINGS:,LEFT VENTRICULOGRAM: , There is no evidence of any wall motion abnormalities with an estimated ejection fraction of 60%.  Left ventricular end-diastolic pressure was 24 mmHg preinjection and 26 mmHg postinjection.  There is no mitral regurgitation.

Mediastinal lymphadenectomy.,ANESTHESIA: , General.,DESCRIPTION OF THE PROCEDURE: , The patient was taken to the operating room and placed on the operating table in the supine position.  After an adequate general anesthesia was given, she was placed in the left lateral decubitus and the right chest was prepped and draped in the sterile fashion.  Lateral thoracotomy was performed on the right side anterior to the tip of the scapula, and this was carried down through the subcutaneous tissue.  The latissimus dorsi muscle was partially transected and then the serratus was reflected anteriorly.  The chest was entered through the fifth intercostal space.  A retractor was placed and then extensive number of adhesions between the lung and the pleura were lysed carefully with sharp and blunt dissection.  The right lower lobe was identified.  There was a large mass in the superior segment of the lobe, which was very close to the right upper lobe, and because of the adhesions, it could not be told if the tumor was extending into the right upper lobe, but it appeared that it did not.  Dissection was then performed at the lower lobe of the fissure, and a GIA stapler was placed through here to separate the tumor from the upper lobe including a small segment of the upper lobe with the lower lobe.  Then, dissection of the hilum was performed, and the branches of the pulmonary artery to the lower lobe were ligated with #2-0 silk freehand ties proximally and distally and #3-0 silk transfixion stitches and then transected.  The inferior pulmonary vein was dissected after dividing the ligament, and it was stapled proximally and distally with a TA30 stapler and then transected.  Further dissection of the fissure allowed for its completion with a GIA stapler and then the bronchus was identified and dissected.  The bronchus was stapled with a TA30 bronchial stapler and then transected, and the specimen was removed and sent to the Pathology Department for frozen section diagnosis.  The frozen section diagnosis was that of non-small cell carcinoma, bronchial margins free and pleural margins free.  The mediastinum was then explored.  No nodes were identified around the pulmonary ligament or around the esophagus.  Subcarinal nodes were dissected, and hemostasis was obtained with clips.  The space below and above the osseous was opened, and the station R4 nodes were dissected.  Hemostasis was obtained with clips and with electrocautery.  All nodal tissue were sent to Pathology as permanent specimen.  Following this, the chest was thoroughly irrigated and aspirated.  Careful hemostasis was obtained and a couple of air leaks were controlled with #6-0 Prolene sutures.  Then, two #28 French chest tubes were placed in the chest, one posteriorly and one anteriorly, and secured to the skin with #2-0 nylon stitches.  The incision was then closed with interrupted #2-0 Vicryl pericostal stitches.  A running #1 PDS on the muscle layer, a running 2-0 PDS in the subcutaneous tissue, and staples on the skin.

       " 'PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Severely comminuted fracture of the distal radius, left.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Severely comminuted fracture of the distal radius, left.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE:  ,Open reduction and internal fixation, high grade Frykman VIII distal radius fracture.,ANESTHESIA: , General endotracheal.,PREOPERATIVE INDICATIONS: , This is a 52-year-old patient of mine who I have repaired both shoulder rotator cuffs, the most recent one in the calendar year 2007.  While he was climbing a ladder recently in the immediate postop stage, he fell suffering the aforementioned heavily comminuted Frykman fracture.  This fracture had a fragment that extended in the distal radial ulnar joint, a die-punch fragment in the center of the radius.  The ulnar styloid and the radial styloid were off and there were severe dorsal comminutions.  He presented to my office the morning of April 3, 2007, having had a left reduction done elsewhere a day ago.  The reduction, although adequate, had allowed for the fragments to settle and I discussed with him the severity of the injury on a scale of 1-8, this was essentially an 8.  The best results have been either with external fixation or internal fixation, most recently volar plating of a locking variety has been popular, and I felt that this would be appropriate in his case.,Risks and benefits otherwise described were bleeding, infection, need to do operative revise or removal of hardware.  He is taking a job out of state in the next couple of months.  Hence I felt that even with close followup, this is a particularly difficult fracture as far as the morbidity of the injury proceeds.,OPERATIVE NOTE: , After adequate general endotracheal anesthesia was obtained, one gram of Ancef was given intravenously.  The left upper extremity was prepped and draped in supine position with the left hand in the arm table, magnification was used throughout.  The time out procedure was done to the satisfaction of all present that this was indeed the appropriate extremity on the appropriate patient.  A small C-arm was brought in to help guide the incision which was a volar curvilinear incision that included as part of this due to the fracture blisters eminent compartment syndrome and numbness in fingers.  A carpal tunnel release was done with the transverse carpal ligament being protected with a Freer elevator.  The usual amount of dissection of the pronator quadratus was necessary to view the distal radial fragment.  The pronator quadratus actually grasped several of the fragments itself which had to be dissected free from them, specifically the distal radial ulnar joint and die-punch fragment.  At this point, a locking Synthes distal radius plate from the modular handset was selected that had five articular screws as well as five locking shaft screws.  The ulnar styloid was not affixed in any portion of this repair.  The plate was viewed under the image intensification device, i.e., x-ray and the screws were placed in this order.  The most proximal shaft screw was placed to allow the remainder of the plate to form a buttress to then rearrange the fragments around the locking screws and a locking plate having been selected from the volar approach, a locking 12-mm screw through 16-mm screws were placed in the following order.  Most proximal on the radial shaft of the plate, then the radial styloid, i.e., the most distal and lateral screw, the next most proximal shaft screw followed by the distal radial ulnar joint screw.  Three screws were locking across the die-punch fragment.  The remaining two screws were placed into the radial shaft.  All of these were locking screws of 2 mm in diameter and as the construct was created, the relative motion of the intra-articular fragment in dorsal comminution all diminished greatly, although the exposure as well as the amount of reduction force used was substantial.  The tourniquet time was 1.5 hours.  At this point, the tourniquet was let down.  The entire construct was irrigated with copious amounts of bacitracin and normal saline.  Closure was affected with 0 Vicryl underneath the skin surface followed by 3-0 Prolene in interrupted sutures in the volar wound.  Several image intensification x-rays were taken at the conclusion of the case to check screw length.  Screw lengths were changed out during the case as needed based on the x-ray findings.  The wound was injected with Marcaine, lidocaine, Depo-Medrol, and Kantrex.  A very heavily padded fluffy cotton Jones-type dressing was applied with a volar splint.  Estimated blood loss was 10 mL.  There were no specimens.  Tourniquet time was 1.5 hours.',\n",

Status post radical retropubic prostatectomy and subsequent salvage radiation therapy.,TITLE OF OPERATION: , Salvage cystectomy (very difficult due to postradical prostatectomy and postradiation therapy to the pelvis), Indiana pouch continent cutaneous diversion, and omental pedicle flap to the pelvis.,ANESTHESIA: , General endotracheal with epidural.,INDICATIONS:  ,This patient is a 65-year-old white male who in 1998 had a radical prostatectomy.  He was initially dry without pads and then underwent salvage radiation therapy for rising PSA.  After that he began with episodes of incontinence as well as urinary retention requiring catheterization.  One year ago, he was unable to catheterize and was taken to the operative room and had cystoscopy.  He had retained staple removed and a diverticulum identified.  There were also bladder stones that were lasered and removed, and he had been incontinent ever since that time.  He wears 8 to 10 pads per day, and this has affected his quality of life significantly.  I took him to the operating room on January 16, 2008, and found diffuse radiation changes with a small capacity bladder and wide-open bladder neck.  We both felt that his lower urinary tract was not rehabilitatable and that a continent cutaneous diversion would solve the number of problems facing him.  I felt like if we could remove the bladder safely, then this would also provide a benefit.,FINDINGS: , At exploration, there were no gross lesions of the smaller or large bowel.  The bladder was predictably sucked into the pelvic sidewall both inferiorly and laterally.  The opened bladder, which we were able to remove completely, had a wide-open capacious diverticulum in its very distal segment.  Because of the previous radiation therapy and a dissection down to the pelvis, I elected to place an omental pedicle flap to provide additional blood supply for healing as well in the pelvis and also under the pubic bone which was exposed inferiorly due to previous surgery and treatment.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:  ,The patient was brought to the operative suite and after adequate general endotracheal and epidural anesthesia obtained, placed in the supine position, flexed over the anterosuperior iliac spine, and his abdomen and genitalia were sterilely prepped and draped in the usual fashion.  A nasogastric tube was placed as well as radial arterial line.  He was given intravenous antibiotics for prophylaxis.  A generous midline skin incision was made from the midepigastrium down to the symphysis pubis, deep into the rectus fascia, the rectus muscle separated in the midline, and exploration carried out with the findings described.  Moist wound towels and a Bookwalter retractor were placed for exposure.  We began by retracting the bowels by mobilizing the cecum and ascending colon and hepatic flexure and elevating the terminal ileum up to the second and third portion of the duodenum.  The ureter was identified as a crisis over the iliac vessels and dissected deep into pelvis and subsequently divided between clips.  An identical procedure was performed in the left side with similar findings and the bowels were packed cephalad.,We began then dissecting the bladder away from the pelvic side walls staying medial to both epigastric arteries.  This was quite challenging because of the previous radiation therapy and radical prostatectomy.  We essentially carved the bladder off of the pelvic sidewall inferiorly as best we could and then we were able to have enough freedom to identify the lateral pedicles, and these were taken between double clips approximately and clipped distally.  We then approached things posteriorly and carefully dissected between the __________ and posterior bladder.  There was some remnant seminal vesicle on the right as well as both remnant ejaculatory duct and we used this to dissect the longus safe plane anterior to the rectum.  We then entered the bladder anteriorly as distal as we could and remove the bladder and what we thought was a bladder neck and this appeared to end in a diverticulum.  We then peeled it off the remaining rectum and passed the specimen off the operative field.  Bladder was irrigated with warm sterile water and a meticulous inspection was made for hemostasis.,We then completely mobilized the omentum off of the proximal transverse colon.  This allowed a generous flap to be able to be laid into the pelvis without tension.,We then turned our attention to forming the Indiana pouch.  I completed the dissection of the right hepatic flexure and the proximal transverse colon and mobilized the omentum off of this portion of the colon.  The colon was divided proximal to the middle colic using a GIA-80 stapler.  I then divided the avascular plane of Treves along the terminal ileum and selected a point approximately 15 cm proximal to the ileocecal valve to divide the ileum.  The mesentery was then sealed with a LigaSure device and divided, and the bowel was divided with a GIA-60 stapler.  We then performed a side-to-side ileo-transverse colostomy using a GIA-80 stapler, closing the open end with a TA 60.  The angles were reinforced with silk sutures and the mesenteric closed with interrupted silk sutures.,We then removed the staple line along the terminal ileum, passed a 12-French Robinson catheter into the cecal segment, and plicated the ileum with 3 firings of the GIA-60 stapler.  The ileocecal valve was then reinforced with interrupted 3-0 silk sutures as described by Rowland, et al, and following this, passage of an 18-French Robinson catheter was associated with the characteristic \"pop,\" indicating that we had adequately plicated the ileocecal valve.,As the patient had had a previous appendectomy, we made an opening in the cecum in the area of the previous appendectomy.  We then removed the distal staple line along the transverse colon and aligned the cecal end and the distal middle colic end with two 3-0 Vicryl sutures.  The bowel segment was then folded over on itself and the reservoir formed with 3 successive applications of the SGIA Polysorb-75.  Between the staple lines, Vicryl sutures were placed and the defects closed with 3-0 Vicryl suture ligatures.,We then turned our attention to forming the ileocolonic anastomosis.  The left ureter was mobilized and brought underneath the sigmoid mesentery and brought through the mesentery of the terminal ileum and an end-to-side anastomosis performed with an open technique using interrupted 4-0 Vicryl sutures, and this was stented with a Cook 8.4-French ureteral stent, and this was secured to the bowel lumen with a 5-0 chromic suture.  The right ureter was brought underneath the pouch and placed in a stented fashion with an identical anastomosis.  We then brought the stents out through a separate incision cephalad in the pouch and they were secured with a 2-0 chromic suture.  A 24-French Malecot catheter was placed through the cecum and secured with a chromic suture.  The staple lines were then buried with a running 3-0 Vicryl two-layer suture and the open end of the pouch closed with a TA 60 Polysorb suture.  The pouch was filled to 240 cc and noted to be watertight, and the ureteral anastomoses were intact.,We then made a final inspection for hemostasis.  The cecostomy tube was then brought out to the right lower quadrant and secured to the skin with silk sutures.  We then matured our stoma through the umbilicus.  We removed the plug of skin through the umbilicus and delivered the ileal segment through this.  A portion of the ileum was removed and healthy, well-vascularized tissue was matured with interrupted 3-0 chromic sutures.  We left an 18-French Robinson through the stomag and secured this to the skin with silk sutures.  The Malecot and stents were also secured in a similar fashion.,We matured the stoma to the umbilicus with interrupted chromic stitches.  The stitch was brought out to the right upper quadrant and the Malecot to the left lower quadrant.  A Large JP drain was placed in the pelvis dependent to the omentum pedicle flap as well as the Indiana pouch.,The rectus fascia was closed with a buried #2 Prolene running stitch, tying a new figure-of-eight proximally and distally and meeting in the middle and tying it underneath the fascia.  Subcutaneous tissue was irrigated with saline and skin was closed with surgical clips.  The estimated blood loss was 450 mL, and the patient received no packed red blood cells.  The final sponge and needle count were reported to be correct.  The patient was awakened and extubated, and taken on stretcher to the recovery room in satisfactory condition.',\n",

The HA\\'s occurred daily; and throughout daylight hours. They diminished at bedtime, but occasionally awakened her in the morning.,Several days following the onset of her HA\\'s, she began experiencing numbness and tingling about the right side of her face. These symptoms improved, but did not completely resolved.,Several days after the onset of facial paresthesias, she began to experience binocular horizontal diplopia. The diplopia resolved when covering either eye, and worsened upon looking toward the right. Coincidentally, she began veering toward the right when walking. She denied any weakness. She had had chronic unsteadiness for many years since developing juvenile rheumatoid arthritis. She was unsure whether her unsteadiness was due to poor depth perception in light of her diplopia.,The patient was admitted locally 9/2/95.

       " 'HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  ,The patient comes in today because of feeling lightheaded and difficulty keeping his balance.  He denies this as a spinning sensation that he had had in the past with vertigo.  He just describes as feeling very lightheaded.  It usually occurs with position changes such as when he stands up from the sitting position or stands up from a lying position.  It tends to ease when he sits down again, but does not totally resolve for another 15 to 30 minutes and he feels shaky and weak all over.  Lorazepam did not help this sensation.  His blood pressure has been up lately and his dose of metoprolol was increased.  They feel these symptoms have gotten worse since metoprolol was increased.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: , Detailed on our H&P form.  Positive for elevated cholesterol, diabetes, glaucoma, cataracts, hypertension, heart disease, vertigo, stroke in May of 2005, congestive heart failure, CABG, and cataract removed right eye.,CURRENT MEDICATIONS: , Detailed on the H&P form.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: , His blood pressure sitting down was 180/80 with a pulse rate of 56.  Standing up blood pressure was 160/80 with a pulse rate of 56.  His general exam and neurological exam were detailed on our H&P form.  Pertinent positives on his neurological exam were decreased sensation in his left face, and left arm and leg.,IMPRESSION AND PLAN:  ,This lightheaded, he exquisitely denies vertigo, the vertigo that he has had in the past.  He states this is more of a lightheaded type feeling.  He did have a mild blood pressure drop here in the office.  We are also concerned that bradycardia might be contributing to his feeling of lightheadedness.  We are going to suggest that he gets a Holter monitor and he should speak to his general practitioner as well as his cardiologist regarding the lightheaded feeling.,We will schedule him for the Holter monitor and refer him back to his cardiologist.',\n",
       " \"HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: ,The patient is a 79-year-old right-handed man who reports that approximately one and a half years ago, he fell down while walking in the living room from the bedroom.  At that time, he reports both legs gave away on him and he fell.  He reported that he had some lightheadedness just before he fell and was slightly confused, but was aware of what was happening around him.  He was able to get up shortly after falling and according to the patient and his son, subsequently returned back to normal.,He was then well until the 3rd of July 2008 when his legs again gave way on him.  This was not preceded by lightheadedness.  He was rushed to the hospital and was found to have pneumonia, and the fall was blamed on the pneumonia.  He started using a walker from that time, prior to that he was able to walk approximately two miles per day.  He again had a fall in August of 2008 after his legs gave way.  Again, there was no lightheadedness associated with this.  He was again found to have pneumonia and again was admitted to hospital after which he went to rehabilitation and was able to use his walker again after this.  He did not, however, return to the pre-July baseline.  In October of 2008, after another fall, he was found to have pneumonia again and shingles.  He is currently in a Chronic Rehabilitation Unit.  He cannot use a walker and uses a wheelchair for everything.  He states that his hands have been numb, involving all the fingers of both hands for the past three weeks.  He is also losing muscle bulk in his hands and has noticed some general weakness of his hands.  He does, however, note that strength in his hands has not been normal since July 2008, but it is clearly getting worse.  He has been aware of some fasciculations in his legs starting in August 2008, these are present both in the lower legs and the thighs.  He does not report any cramps, problems with swallowing or problems with breathing.  He reports that he has had constipation alternating with diarrhea, although there has been no loss of control of either his bowel or bladder.  He has had some problems with blood pressure drops, and does feel presyncopal when he stands.  He also reports that he has no feeling in his feet, and that his feet feel like sponges.  This has been present for about nine months.  He has also lost joint position sense in his feet for approximately nine months.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:,1.  Pneumonia.  He has had recurrent episodes of pneumonia, which started at approximately age 20.  These have been treated repeatedly over the years, and on average he has tended to have an episode of pneumonia once every five years, although this has been far more frequent in the past year.  He is usually treated with antibiotics and then discharged.  There is no known history of bronchiectasis, inherited lung disease or another chronic pulmonary cause for the repeated pneumonia.,2.  He has had a catheter placed for urinary retention, his urologist has told him that he thinks that this may be due to prostate enlargement.  The patient does not have any history of diabetes and does not report any other medical problems.  He has lost approximately 18 pounds in the past month.,3.  He had an appendectomy in the 1940s.,4.  He had an ankle resection in 1975.,SOCIAL HISTORY:  ,The patient stopped smoking 27 years ago, he smoked approximately two packs a day with combined cigarettes and cigars.

His pain score was 0.,APPEARANCE:  No acute distress.  He is pleasant and well-groomed.,HEENT:  Atraumatic, normocephalic.  No carotid bruits appreciated.,LUNGS:  There were few coarse crackles in both lung bases.,CARDIOVASCULAR:  Revealed a normal first and second heart sound, with no third or fourth heart sound and no murmurs.  The pulse was regular and of normal volume.,ABDOMEN:  Soft with no masses and normal bowel sounds.  There were no carotid bruits.,EXTREMITIES:  No contractures appreciated.,NEUROLOGICAL EXAM:,MSE:  His orientation, language, calculations, 100-7 tests were all normal.  There was atrophy and fasciculations in both the arms and legs.,CRANIAL NERVES:  Cranial nerve examination was normal with the exception that there was some mild atrophy of his tongue and possible fasciculations.  His palatal movement was normal and gag reflex was normal.,MOTOR:  Strength was decreased in all muscle groups as follows:  Deltoid 4/4, biceps 4+/4+, triceps 5/5, wrist extensors 4+/4+, finger extensors 4-/4-, finger flexors 4-/4-, interossei 4-/4-, hip flexors 4+/4+, hip extensors 4+/4+, knee extensors 4/4, and knee flexors 4/4.  Foot dorsiflexion, plantar flexion, eversion, toe extension and toe flexion was all 0 to 1.  There was atrophy in both hands and general atrophy of the lower limb muscles.  The feet were both cold and showed dystrophic features.  Fasciculations were present mainly in the hands.  There was evidence of dysmetria and past pointing in the left hand.,REFLEXES:  Reflexes were 0 in all sites in the arms and legs.  The jaw reflex was 2+.  Vibration was severely decreased at the elbow and wrist and was absent in the fingers.  Vibration was absent in the toes and ankle bilaterally and was severely decreased at the knee.  Joint position sense was absent in the toes and severely decreased in the fingers.  Pin perception was absent in the feet and was decreased to the upper thighs.  Pin was decreased or absent in the fingers and decreased above the elbows.  The same distribution of sensory loss was found with monofilament testing.,COORDINATION:  Coordination was barely normal in the right hand.  Rapid alternating movements were decreased in the left hand greater than the right hand.  The patient was unable to stand and therefore gait, Romberg's test and balance could not be assessed.,DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES: , Previous diagnostic studies and patient reports.  There were extensive patient reports, all of which were reviewed.  A previous x-ray study of the lateral chest performed in October 2008 showed poor inspiration with basilar atelectasis and an infiltrate.  An x-ray of the cervical, thoracic and lumbar spine showed some evidence of lumbar spinal stenosis.  A CTA of the neck with and without contrast performed in November 2008 showed minor stenosis in the left carotid, a mild hard and soft plaque in the right carotid with approximately 55% stenosis.  The posterior circulation showed a slightly dominant right vertebral artery with no stenosis.  There was no significant stenosis, but there was minor extracranial stenosis noted.  An MRI of the brain with and without contrast performed in November 2008 showed no evidence of an acute infarct, major vascular occlusion, and no abnormal enhancement with gadolinium administration.  There was also no significant sinusitis or mastoiditis.  This was an essentially normal brain MRI.  A CBC performed in January 2009 showed an elevated white cell count of 11.3, a low red cell count of 3.43, elevated MCH of 32.4 and the rest of the study was normal.  An electrolyte study performed in January 2009 showed a sodium which was low at 127, a calcium which was low at 8.3, and a low protein of 5.2 and albumin of 3.1.  The glucose was 86.  TSH performed in January 2009 was 1.57, which is within the normal range.  Vitamin B12 was greater than a 1000, which is normal and the folate was 18.2, which was normal.  A myocardial stress study performed in December 2008 showed normal myocardial perfusion with Persantine Cardiolite SPECT.  The ECG was non-diagnostic.  There was normal regional wall motion of the left ventricle.  The left ventricular ejection fraction was 68%, which is within the normal range for males.  A CT of the lumbar spine without contrast performed in December 2008 showed a broad-based disc bulge at L1-L2, L2-L3, L3-L4 and L4-L5.  At L5-S1, in addition to the broad-based disc bulge, there was also an osteophyte complex and evidence of flavum hypertrophy without canal stenosis.  There was severe bilateral neural foraminal stenosis at L5-S1 and moderate neural foraminal stenosis at L1-L4.  An echocardiogram was performed in November 2008 and showed mild left atrial enlargement, normal left ventricular systolic function, mild concentric left ventricular hypertrophy, scleral degenerative changes in the aortic and mitral apparatus, mild mitral regurgitation, mild tricuspid regurgitation and mild to moderate aortic regurgitation.,DIAGNOSTIC IMPRESSION:  ,The patient presents with a severe neuropathy with marked large fiber sensory as well as motor findings.  He is diffusely weak as well as atrophic in all muscle groups both in his upper and lower extremities, although he is disproportionately weak in his lower extremities.  His proprioceptive and vibratory loss is severe in both the distal upper and lower extremities, signifying that he either has a severe sensory neuropathy or has involvement of the dorsal root ganglia.  According to the history, which was carefully checked, the initial onset of these symptoms goes back one and a half years, although there has only been significant progression in his condition since July 2008.  As indicated below, further diagnostic studies including a detailed nerve conduction and EMG test today showed evidence of a severe sensory, motor, and axonal neuropathy and in addition there was evidence of a diffuse polyradiculopathy.  There was no involvement of the tongue on EMG.  The laboratory testing as indicated below failed to show a specific cause for the neuropathy.  We are still, however, waiting for the paraneoplastic antibodies, which were send out lab to the Mayo Clinic.  This type of very severe sensorimotor neuropathy with significant proprioceptive loss may be seen in several conditions including peripheral nerve vasculitis due to a variety of disorders such as SLE, Sjogren's, rheumatoid arthritis, and mixed connective tissue disease.  In addition, it may also be seen with certain toxins, particularly chemotherapeutic agents.  The patient did not receive any of these.  It may also be seen as part of a paraneoplastic syndrome.  Although the patient does not have any specific clinical symptoms of a cancer, it is noted that he has had an 18-pound weight loss in the past month and does have a remote history of smoking.  We have requested that he obtain a CT of his chest, abdomen and pelvis while he is in Acute Rehabilitation.  The verbal reports of these possibly did not show any evidence of a cancer.  We did also request that he obtain a gallium scan to see if there was any evidence of an unsuspected neoplasm.  The patient did undergo a nerve and muscle biopsy, this was a radial nerve and biceps muscle biopsy from the left arm.  This showed evidence of severe axonal loss.  There was no evidence of a vasculitis.  The vessels did show some mild intimal changes that would be consistent with atherosclerosis.  There were a few perivascular changes; however, there was no clear evidence of a necrotizing vasculitis even on multiple sections.  The muscle biopsy showed severe muscle fiber atrophy, with evidence of fiber grouping.  Again, there was no evidence of inflammation or vasculitis.  Evaluation so far has also shown no evidence of an amyloid neuropathy, no evidence of a monoclonal gammopathy, of sarcoidosis, and again there is no past history of a significant toxin or infective cause for the neuropathy.  Specifically, there is no history of HIV exposure.  We would await the results of the gallium scan and of the paraneoplastic antibodies to see if these are helpful in making a diagnosis.  At this point, because of the severity and the axonal nature of the neuropathy, there is no specific therapy that will reverse the course of the illness, unless we find a specific etiology that can be stopped or reversed.  I have discussed these issues at length with the patient and with his son.  We also addressed whether or not there might be a previously undiagnosed inherited neuropathy.  I think this is unlikely given the short history and the rapid progression of the disorder.,There is also no family history that we can detect a neuropathy, and the patient does not have the typical phenotype for a chronic inherited neuropathy such as Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2.  However, since I have only seen the patient on one occasion and do not know what his previous examination showed two years ago, I cannot be certain that there may not have been the presence of a neuropathy preceding this.,PLAN:,1.  Nerve conduction and EMG will be performed today.  The results were indicated above.,2.  The following laboratory studies were requested including electrolytes, CBC, thyroid function tests, B12, ANA, C-reactive protein, complement, cryoglobulins, double-stranded DNA antibodies, folate level, hemoglobin A1c, immunofixation electrophoresis, P-ANCA, C-ANCA, protein electrophoresis, rheumatoid factor, paraneoplastic antibody studies requested from the Mayo Clinic, B12.  These studies showed minor changes, which included a low sodium level of 129 as previously noted, a low creatinine of 0.74, low calcium of 8.6, low total protein of 5.7.  The B12 was greater than 2000.  The immunoelectrophoresis, ANA, double-stranded DNA, ANCA, hemoglobin A1c, folate, cryoglobulins, complement, C-reactive protein were all normal or negative.  The B12 level was greater than 2000.  Liver function tests were normal.  The glucose was 90.  ESR was 10.  Hemoglobin A1c was 5.5.,3.  A left radial sensory and left biceps biopsy were requested and have been performed and interpreted as indicated above.,4.  CT of chest, abdomen and pelvis.,5.  Whole body gallium scan for evidence of an underlying neoplasm.,6.  The patient will go to the Rehabilitation Facility for Acute Rehabilitation and Training.,7.  We have not made any changes to his medication.  He does have some mild orthostatic changes; however, he is adequately controlled with midodrine at a dose of 2.5 mg three times a day as needed up to 5 mg four times a day.  Usually, he uses a lower dose of 2.5 three times a day to 5 mg three times a day.,8.  Followup will be as determined by the family.\",\n",

A gauze throat pack was placed and local anesthetic was administered in all four quadrants, a total of 6.8 mL of lidocaine 2% with 1:100,000 epinephrine, and 3.6 mL of Marcaine 0.5% with 1:200,000 epinephrine.  The area in the left vestibular area adjacent to the teeth #18 and #19 was aspirated with 5 cc syringe with an 18-guage needle and approximately 1 mL of purulent material was aspirated.  This was placed on the culture medium in the aerobic and anaerobic culture tubes and the tubes were then sent to the lab.  An incision was then made in the left mandibular vestibule adjacent to teeth #18 and #19.  The area was bluntly dissected with a curved hemostat and a small amount of approximately 3 mL of purulent material was drained.  Penrose drain was then placed using a curved hemostat.  The drain was secured with 3-0 silk suture.  The extraction of the teeth was then begun on the left side removing teeth #12, #15, #18 and #19 with forceps extraction, then moving to the right side teeth #2, #5, and #31 were removed with forceps extraction uneventfully.  After completion of the procedure, the throat pack was removed, the pharynx was suctioned.  The anesthesiologist then placed an orogastric tube and suctioned approximately 10 cc of stomach contents with the nasogastric tube.  The nasogastric tube was then removed.  Patient was then extubated and taken to the PACU in stable condition.',\n",

He is brought to the operating room for transurethral resection of that bladder tumor.,DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION: , After preoperative counseling of the patient and his wife, the patient was taken to the operating room and administered a spinal anesthetic.  He was placed in lithotomy position and prepped and draped in the usual fashion.  Using the visual obturator, the resectoscope was then inserted per urethra into the bladder.  The bladder was inspected confirming previous cystoscopic findings of a 2.5- to 3-cm left lateral wall bladder tumor away from the ureteral orifice.  Using the resectoscope loop, the tumor was then resected down to its base in a stepwise fashion.  Following completion of resection down to the base, the bladder was _______ free of tumor specimen.  The resectoscope was then reinserted and the base of the bladder tumor was then resected to get the base of the bladder tumor specimen, this was sent as a separate pathological specimen.  Hemostasis was assured with electrocautery.  The base of the tumor was then fulgurated again and into the periphery out in the normal mucosa surrounding the base of the bladder tumor.  Following completion of the fulguration, there was good hemostasis.  The remainder of the bladder was without evidence of significant abnormality.  Both ureteral orifices were visualized and noted to drain freely of clear urine.  The bladder was filled and the resectoscope was removed.  A 22-French 3-way Foley catheter was inserted per urethra into the bladder.  The balloon was inflated to 30 mL.

Additional aspect of the temporalis muscle and fascia were incised with cutting Bovie current with effort made to preserve the posterior limb of the external carotid artery.  The scalp and temporalis muscle were then retracted anteroinferiorly with 0 silk sutures, attached rubber bands and Allis clamps and similar retraction of the posterior aspect of temporalis was retracted with 0 silk suture, attached with rubber bands and Allis clamps.  The bone flap, which had not been fixed in place was removed.  An additional portion of the temporofrontal bone based at the zygoma was removed with a B1 dissecting tool, B1 attached to the Midas Rex instrumentation.  Further bone removal was accomplished with Leksell rongeur, and hemostasis controlled with the use of bone wax.,At this point, a retractor was placed along the frontal lobe for visualization of the perichiasmatic cistern with visualization made of the optic nerve and carotid artery.  It should be noted that cottonoid paddies were placed over the brain to protect the cortical surface of the brain both underneath the retractor and the remainder of the exposed cortex.  The sylvian fissure was then dissected with the dissection description being dictated by Dr. X.,Following successful splitting of the sylvian fissure to its apparent midplate, attention was next turned to the temporal tip where the approximate location of the cerebral aneurysm noted on CT angio, as well as conventional arteriography was noted and a peel incision was made extending from the temporal tip approximately 3 cm posterior.  This was enlarged with bipolar coagulation and aspiration and inferior dissection accomplished under the operating microscope until the dome of, what appeared to be, an aneurysm could be visualized.,Dissection around the dome with bipolar coagulation and aspiration revealed a number of abnormal vessels, which appeared to be involved with the aneurysm at its base and these were removed with bipolar coagulation.  Until circumferential dissection revealed 1 major arterial supply to the base of the aneurysm, this was felt to be able to be handled with bipolar coagulation, which was done and the vessel then cut with microscissors and the aneurysm removed in toto.,Attention was next turned to the apparent nidus of the arteriovenous malformation, which was somewhat medial and inferior to the aneurysm and the nidus was then dissected with the use of bipolar coagulation and aspiration microscissors as further described by Dr. X. With removal of the arteriovenous malformation, attention was then turned to the previous frontal cortical incision, which was the site of partial decompression of the patient's intracerebral hematoma on the day of her admission.  Self-retaining retractors were placed within this cortical incision, and the hematoma cavity entered with additional hematoma removed with general aspiration and irrigation.  Following removal of additional hematoma, the bed of the hematoma site was lined with Surgicel.  Irrigation revealed no further active bleeding, and it was felt that at this time both the arteriovenous malformation, associated aneurysm, and intracerebral hematoma had been sequentially dealt with.,The cortical surface was then covered with Surgicel and the dura placed over the surface of the brain after coagulation of the dural edges, the freeze dried fascia, which had been used at the time of the 1st surgery was replaced over the surface of the brain with additional areas of cortical exposure covered with a DuraGuard.  The 2nd bone flap from the inferior frontotemporal region centered along the zygoma was reattached to the initial bone flap at 3 sites using a small 2-holed plate and 3-mm screws and the portable minidriver.,With this, return of the inferior plate accomplished, it was possible to reposition the bone flaps into their initial configuration, and attachments were secured anterior and posterior with somewhat longer 2-holed plates and 3-mm screws to the frontal and posterior temporal parietal region.  The wound was then closed.  It should be noted that a pledget of Gelfoam had been placed over the entire dural complex prior to returning the bone flap.  The wound was then closed by approximating the temporalis muscle with 2-0 Vicryl suture, the fascia was closed with 2-0 Vicryl suture, and the galea was closed with 2-0 interrupted suture, and the skin approximated with staples.  The patient appeared to tolerate the procedure well without complications.\",\n",

On physical examination, she was derived to have a severely deviated septum with an S-shape deformity as well as turbinate hypertrophy present along the inferior turbinates contributing to the obstruction.,PROCEDURE:  ,After all risks, benefits, and alternatives have been discussed with the patient in detail, informed consent was obtained.  The patient was brought to the Operating Suite where she was placed in the supine position and general endotracheal intubation was delivered by the Department of Anesthesia.  The patient was rotated 90 degrees away.  Nasal pledgets saturated with 4 cc of 10% cocaine solution were inserted into the nasal cavities.  These were then removed and the nasal septum as well as the turbinates were localized with the mixture of 1% lidocaine with 1:100000 epinephrine solution.  The nasal pledgets were then reinserted as the patient was prepped in the usual fashion.  The nasal pledgets were again removed and the turbinates as well as an infraorbital nerve block was performed with 0.25% Marcaine solution.  The nasal vestibules were then cleansed with a pHisoHex solution.  A #15 blade scalpel was then used to make an incision along the length of the caudal septum.  The mucoperichondrial junction was then identified with the aid of cotton-tipped applicator as well as the stitch scissor.  Once the plane was identified, the mucosal flap on the left side of the septum was elevated with the aid of a Cottle.  At this point it should be mentioned that the patient's septum was significantly deviated with a large S-shape deformity obstructing both the right and left nasal cavity with the convex portion present in the left nasal cavity.  Again, the Cottle elevator was used to raise the mucosal flap down to the level of the septal spur.  At this point, the septal knife was used to make a crossover incision through the cartilage just anterior to the septal spur.  Again, the mucosal flap was elevated in the right nasal septum.  Now Knight scissors were used to remove the ascending portion of the nasal cartilage, which was then removed with a Takahashi forceps.  A Cottle elevator was used to further elevate the mucosal flap off the septal spur on the left side.  Removal of the spur was performed with the aid of the septal knife as well as a 3 mm straight chisel.  Once all ascending cartilage has been removed, inspection of the nasal cavity revealed patent passages with the exception of inferior turbinates that were very hypertrophied and was felt to be contributing to the patient's symptoms.  Therefore, the turbinates were again localized and a #15 blade scalpel was used to make a vertical incision dissected down to the chondral bone.  The XPS microdebrider with the inferior turbinate blade was then inserted through the incision and a submucous resection was performed by passing the microdebrider along the length of the bone.  Once the submucosal tissue had been resected, an outfracture procedure was performed so as to fully open the nasal passages.  Inspection revealed very patent and nonobstructive nasal passages.  Now the caudal incision was reapproximated with #4-0 chromic suture.  Finally, a #4-0 fast absorbing plain gut suture was used to approximate the mucosal surface of the septum in a running whipstitch fashion.  Finally, Merocel packing was placed and the patient was retuned to the Department of Anesthesia for awakening and taken to the recovery room without incident.\",\n",

Under effects of general endotracheal anesthesia, markings were made preoperatively for the mastopexy.  An eccentric circle was drawn around the nipple and a wedge drawn from the inferior border of the areola to the inframammary fold.  A stab incision was made bilaterally and tumescent infiltration of anesthesia, lactated ringers with 1 cc of epinephrine to 1000 cc of lactated ringers was infused with a tumescent blunt needle.  200 cc was infiltrated on each side.  This was followed by power-assisted liposuction and manual liposuction with removal of 350 cc of supernatant fat from both sides utilizing a radial tunneling technique with a 4-mm cannula.  This was followed by the epithelialization of skin between the inner circle corresponding to the diameter of the areola 4 cm diameter and the outer eccentric circle with a tangent at the 6 o'clock position.  This would result in an elevation of the nipple-areolar complex with transposition.  The epithelialization of the wedge inferiorly equalized the circumference distance between the inner circle and the outer circle.  Hemostasis was achieved with electrocautery.  After the epithelialization was performed on both sides, nipple-areolar complex was transposed to new nipple position and the wedge was closed with transposition of the nipple-areolar complex beneath the transposed nipple.

The patient was placed in the supine position with all pressure points noted and well padded.  The patient was prepped and draped in standard fashion.  An incision was made approximately above the level of the cricoid.  Blunt dissection was used to expose the anterior portion of the spine with carotid moved laterally and trachea and esophagus moved medially.  We then placed needle into the disc spaces and was found to be at C5-C6.  Distracting pins were placed in the body of C4 and in to the body of C6.  The disc was then completely removed at C4-C5.  There was very significant compression of the cord.  This was carefully removed to avoid any type of pressure on the cord.  This was very severe and multiple free fragments were noted.  This was taken down to the level of ligamentum.  Both foramen were then also opened.  Other free fragments were also found behind the body of C5, part of the body of C5 was taken down to assure that all of these were removed.  The exact same procedure was done at C5-C6; however, if there were again free fragments noted, there was less not as severe compression at the C4-C5 area.

Bone biopsy (medically necessary).,ANESTHESIA:, General,COMPLICATIONS:, None,BLOOD LOSS:, Minimal,INDICATIONS:,  Mrs. Smith is a 75-year-old female who has had severe back pain that began approximately three months ago and is debilitating.  She has been unresponsive to nonoperative treatment modalities including bed rest and analgesics.  She presents with and is on medication therapy for COPD, diabetes and hypertension (other co-morbidities may be present upon admission and should be documented in the operative note).,Radiographic imaging including MRI confirms multiple compression fractures of the thoracolumbar spine including T12, L1 and L2.  In addition to the fractures, she presents with kyphotic posture.  Films on 1/04 demonstrated L1 and L2 osteoporotic fractures.  Films on 2/04 demonstrated increased loss of height at L1.  Films on 3/04 demonstrated a new compression fracture at T12 and further collapse of L1.  The L2 fracture is documented on radiographic studies as being chronic and a year or more old.  The T12 fracture has the most significant kyphotic deformity.  Based on these findings, we have decided to perform KYPHON Balloon Kyphoplasty on the L1 and T12 fractures.,PROCEDURE:,  The patient was brought to the operating room/radiology suite and general anesthesia/local sedation with endotracheal intubation was performed.  The patient was positioned prone on the Jackson table.  The back was prepped and draped.  The image intensifier (C-arm) was brought into position and the T12 pedicles were identified and marked with a skin marker.  In view of the collapse of T12, a transpedicular approach to the vertebral body was appropriate.  An 11-gauge needle was advanced through the T12 pedicle to the junction of the pedicle and vertebral body on the right side.  Positioning was confirmed on the AP and lateral plane.  Following satisfactory placement of the needle, the stylet was removed.  A guide pin was inserted through the 11g to a point 3mm from the anterior cortex.  AP and lateral images were taken to verify position and trajectory.  Alongside of the guide pin a 1-cm paramedian incision was made.  The needle was then removed leaving the guide pin in place.  The osteointroducer was placed over the guide pin and advanced through the pedicle.  Once I was at the junction of the pedicle and the vertebral body, a lateral image was taken to insure that the cannula was positioned approximately 1cm past the vertebral body wall.  Through the cannula, a drill was advanced into the vertebral body under fluoroscopic guidance toward the anterior cortex, creating a channel.  The anterior cortex was probed with the guide pin to ensure no perforations in the anterior cortex.  After completing the entry into the vertebral body, a 15 mm inflatable bone tamp was inserted through the cannula and advanced under fluoroscopic guidance into the vertebral body near the anterior cortex.  The radiopaque marker bands on the bone tamp were identified using AP and lateral images.  The above sequence of instrument placement was then repeated on the left side of the T12 vertebral body.  Once both bone tamps were in position, they were inflated to 0.5 cc and 50 psi.  Expansion of the bone tamps was done sequentially in increments of 0.25 to 0.5 cc of contrast, with careful attention being paid to the inflation pressures and balloon position.  The inflation was monitored with AP and lateral imaging.  The final balloon volume was 3.5 cc on the right side and 3 cc on the left.  There was no breach of the lateral wall or anterior cortex of the vertebral body.  Direct reduction of the fracture was achieved, end plate movement was noted and approximately 5 mm of height restoration was achieved.  Under fluoroscopic imaging, and the use of the bone void fillers, internal fixation was achieved through a low-pressure injection of KYPHON HV-R bone cement.  The cavity was filled with a total volume of 3.5 cc on the right side and 3 cc on the left side.  Once the bone cement had hardened, the cannulas were then removed.,At this time, we proceeded to perform a balloon kyphoplasty at L1 using the same sequence of steps as on T12.  An entry needle was placed bilaterally through the pedicle into the vertebral body, a cortical window was created, inflation of the bone tamps directly reduced the fracture, the bone tamps were removed, and internal fixation by bone void filler insertion was achieved.  Throughout the procedure, AP and lateral imaging monitored positioning.,Post-procedure, all incisions were closed with sutures.  The patient was kept in the prone position for approximately 10 minutes post cement injection.  She was then turned supine, monitored briefly and returned to the floor.  She was moving both her lower extremities at this time.,Throughout the procedure, there were no intraoperative complications.  Estimated blood loss was minimal.',\n",

Sponge, needle, and instrument counts were correct per OR staff.,HISTORY:,  This is a 57-year-old female who was found to have a large left adrenal mass, approximately 5.5 cm in size.  She had undergone workup previously with my associate, Dr. X as well as by Endocrinology, and showed this to be a nonfunctioning mass.  Due to the size, the patient was advised to undergo an adrenalectomy and she chose the laparoscopic approach due to her multiple pulmonary comorbidities.,INTRAOPERATIVE FINDINGS: , Showed multiple intraabdominal adhesions in the anterior abdominal wall.  The spleen and liver were unremarkable.  The gallbladder was surgically absent.,There was large amount of omentum and bowel in the pelvis, therefore the gynecological organs were not visualized.  There was no evidence of peritoneal studding or masses.  The stomach was well decompressed as well as the bladder.,PROCEDURE DETAILS: , After informed consent was obtained from the patient, she was taken to the operating room and given general anesthesia.  She was placed on a bean bag and secured to the table.  The table was rotated to the right to allow gravity to aid in our retraction of the bowel.,Prep was performed.  Sterile drapes were applied.  Using the Hassan technique, we placed a primary laparoscopy port approximately 3 cm lateral to the umbilicus on the left.  Laparoscopy was performed with ___________.  At this point, we had a second trocar, which was 10 mm to 11 mm port.  Using the non-cutting trocar in the anterior axillary line and using Harmonic scalpel, we did massive lysis of adhesions from the anterior abdominal wall from the length of the prior abdominal incision, the entire length of the abdominal incision from the xiphoid process to the umbilicus.  The adhesions were taken down off the entire anterior abdominal wall.,At this point, secondary and tertiary ports were placed.  We had one near the midline in the subcostal region and to the left midline and one at the midclavicular line, which were also 10 and 11 ports using a non-cutting blade.,At this point, using the Harmonic scalpel, we opened the white line of Toldt on the left and reflected the colon medially, off the anterior aspect of the Gerota's fascia.  Blunt and sharp dissection was used to isolate the upper pole of the kidney, taking down some adhesions from the spleen.  The colon was further mobilized medially again using gravity to aid in our retraction.  After isolating the upper pole of the kidney using blunt and sharp dissection as well as the Harmonic scalpel, we were able to dissect the plane between the upper pole of the kidney and lower aspect of the adrenal gland.  We were able to isolate the adrenal vein, dumping into the renal vein, this was doubly clipped and transected.  There was also noted to be vascular structure of the upper pole, which was also doubly clipped and transected.  Using the Harmonic scalpel, we were able to continue free the remainder of the adrenal glands from its attachments medially, posteriorly, cephalad, and laterally.,At this point, using the EndoCatch bag, we removed the adrenal gland through the primary port in the periumbilical region and sent the flap for analysis.  Repeat laparoscopy showed no additional findings.  The bowel was unremarkable, no evidence of bowel injury, no evidence of any bleeding from the operative site.,The operative site was irrigated copiously with saline and reinspected and again there was no evidence of bleeding.  The abdominal cavity was desufflated and was reinspected.  There was no evidence of bleeding.,At this point, the camera was switched to one of the subcostal ports and the primary port in the periumbilical region was closed under direct vision using #0 Vicryl suture.  At this point, each of the other ports were removed and then with palpation of each of these ports, this indicated that the non-cutting ports did close and there was no evidence of fascial defects.,At this point, the procedure was terminated.  The abdominal cavity was desufflated as stated.  The patient was sent to Recovery in stable condition.  Postoperative orders were written.  The procedure was discussed with the patient's family at length.\",\n",

All risks and benefits were explained.  Questions answered.  Options discussed.  No guarantees were made.  She wished to proceed with surgery.,PROCEDURE: , After administering appropriate antibiotics and MAC anesthesia, the upper extremity was prepped and draped in the usual standard fashion, the arm was exsanguinated with Esmarch, and the tourniquet inflated to 250 mmHg.,I made a transverse incision one fingerbreadth proximal to the distal volar wrist crease.  Dissection was carried down to the antebrachial fascia, which was cut in a distally based fashion.  Bipolar electrocautery was used to maintain meticulous hemostasis.  I then performed an antebrachial fasciotomy proximally.  I entered the extra bursal space deep into the transverse carpal ligament and used the spatula probe and then the dilators and then the square probe to enlarge the area.  Great care was taken to feel the washboard undersurface of the transverse carpal ligament and the hamate on the ulnar side.  Great care was taken with placement.  A good plane was positively identified.  I then placed the endoscope in and definitely saw the transverse striations of the deep surface of the transverse carpal ligament.,Again, I felt the hook of the hamate ulnar to me.  I had my thumb on the distal aspect of the transverse carpal ligament.  I then partially deployed the blade, and starting 1 mm from the distal edge, the transverse carpal ligament was positively identified.  I pulled back and cut and partially tightened the transverse carpal ligament.  I then feathered through the distal ligament and performed a full-thickness incision through the distal half of the ligament.  I then checked to make sure this was properly performed and then cut the proximal aspect.  I then entered the carpal tunnel again and saw that the release was complete, meaning that the cut surfaces of the transverse carpal ligament were separated; and with the scope rotated, I could see only one in the field at a time.  Great care was taken and at no point was there any longitudinal structure cut.  Under direct vision through the incision, I made sure that the distal antebrachial fascia was cut.  Following this, I irrigated and closed the skin.  The patient was dressed and sent to the recovery room in good condition.',\n",

This procedure as well as alternatives to this procedure was discussed at length with the patient and her son, who has the power of attorney, and they understood them well.,Risks and benefits were also discussed.  Risks include bleeding, infection, damage to blood vessels, damage to nerves, risk of further surgery, chronic pain, restricted range of motion, risk of continued discomfort, risk of malunion, risk of nonunion, risk of need for further reconstructive procedures, risk of need for altered activities and altered gait, risk of blood clots, pulmonary embolism, myocardial infarction, and risk of death were discussed.  She understood these well and consented, and the son signed the consent for the procedure as described.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: , The patient was placed on the operating table and general anesthesia was achieved.  The patient was then placed in fracture boots and manipulated under fluoroscopic control until we could obtain near anatomic alignment.  External positions were felt to be present.  At this point, the left hip and left lower extremity was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.  A guidewire was then placed percutaneously into the tip of the greater trochanter and a small incision was made overlying the guidewire.  An overlying drill was inserted to the proper depths.  A Synthes 11 x 130 degrees trochanteric fixation that was chosen was placed into the intramedullary canal to the proper depth.  Proper rotation was obtained and the guide for the helical blade was inserted.  A small incision was made for this as well.  A guidewire was inserted and felt to be in proper position, in the posterior aspect of the femoral head, lateral, and the center position on AP.  This placed the proper depths and lengths better.  The outer cortex was enlarged and an 85-mm helical blade was attached to the proper depths and proper fixation was done.  Appropriate size screw was then tightened down.  At this point, a distal guide was then placed and drilled across both the cortices.  Length was better.  Appropriate size screw was then inserted.  Proper size and fit of the distal screw was also noted.  At this point, on fluoroscopic control, it was confirming in AP and lateral direction.  We did a near anatomical alignment to the fracture site and all hardware was properly fixed.  Proper size and fit was noted.  Excellent bony approximation was noted.  At this point, both wounds were thoroughly irrigated, hemostasis confirmed, and closure was then begun.,The fascial layers were then reapproximated using #1 Vicryl in a figure-of-eight manner, the subcutaneous tissues were reapproximated in layers using #1 and 2-0 Vicryl sutures, and the skin was reapproximated with staples.  The area was then infiltrated with a mixture of a 0.25% Marcaine with Epinephrine and 1% plain lidocaine.  Sterile dressing was then applied.  No complication was encountered throughout the procedure.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  The patient was taken to the recovery room in stable condition.',\n",

General endotracheal intubation was performed by the Anesthesia Department and the perineum, scrotum, penis, and lower abdomen from the umbilicus down was prepped and draped in the sterile fashion in a 15-minute prep including iodine solution in the urethra.  The bladder was subsequently drained with a red Robinson catheter.  At that point, the patient was then draped in a sterile fashion and an infraumbilical midline incision was made and taken down through the subcutaneous space.  Care was maintained to avoid all bleeding as possible secondary to the fact that we could not use Bovie cautery secondary to the patient's pacemaker and monopolar was only source of hemostasis besides suture.  At that point, we got down to the fascia and the dorsal venous complex was easily identified as were both corporal bodies.  Attention was taken then to the tubing, going up to the reservoir in the right lower quadrant.  This was dissected out bluntly and sharply with Metzenbaum scissors and monopolar used for hemostasis.  At this point, as we tracked this proximally to the area of the rectus muscle, we found that the tubing was violated and this was likely the source of his malfunctioned inflatable penile prosthesis.  As we tried to remove the tubing and get to the reservoir, the tubing in fact completely broke as due to wire inside the tubing and the reservoir was left in its place secondary to risk of going after it and bleeding without the use of cautery.  At that point, this tubing was then tracked down to the pump, which was fairly easily removed from the dartos pouch in the right scrotum.  This was brought up into _________ incision and the two tubings going towards the two cylinders were subsequently tracked, first starting on the right side where a corporotomy incision was made at the placement of two #3-0 Prolene stay ties, staying lateral and anterior on the corporal body.  The corporal body was opened up and the cylinder was removed from the right side without difficulty.  However, we did have significant difficulty separating the tube connecting the pump to the right cylinder since this was surrounded by dense connective tissue and without the use of Bovie cautery, this was very difficult and was very time consuming, but we were able to do this and attention was then taken to the left side where the left proximal corporotomy was made after placement of two stick tie stay sutures.  This was done anterior and lateral staying away from the neurovascular bundle in the midline and this was done proximally on the corporal body.  The left cylinder was then subsequently explanted and this was very difficult as well trying to tract the tubing from the left cylinder across the midline back to the right pump since this was also densely scarred in and _________ a small amount of bleeding, which was controlled with monopolar and cautery was used on three different occasions, but just simple small burst under the guidance of anesthesia and there was no ectopy noted.  After removal of half of the pump, all the tubing, and both cylinders, these were passed off the table as specimen.  Both corporal bodies were then dilated with the Pratt dilators.  These were already fairly well dilated secondary to explantation of our cylinders and antibiotic irrigation was copiously used at this point and irrigated out both of our corporal spaces.  At this point, using the Farlow device, corporal bodies were measured first proximally then distally and they both measured out to be 9 cm proximally and 12 cm distally.  He had an 18 cm with rear tips in place, which were removed.  We decided to go ahead to and use another 18 cm inflatable penile prosthesis.  Confident with our size, we then placed rear tips, originally 3 cm rear tips, however, we had difficulty placing the rear tips into the left crest.  We felt that this was just a little bit too long and replaced both rear tips and down sized from 2 cm to 1 cm.  At this point, we went ahead and placed the right cylinder using the Farlow device and the Keith needle, which was brought out through the glans penis and hemostated and the posterior rear tip was subsequently placed proximally, entered the crest without difficulty.  Attention was then taken to the left side with the same thing was carried out, however, we did happen to dilate on two separate occasions both proximally and distally secondary to a very snug fit as well as buckling of the cylinders.  This then forced us to down size to the 1 cm rear tips, which slipping very easily with the Farlow device through the glans penis.  There was no crossover and no violation of the tunica albuginea.  The rear tips were then placed without difficulty and our corporotomies were closed with #2-0 PDS in a running fashion.  ________ starting on the patient's right side and then on the left side without difficulty and care was maintained to avoid damage or needle injury to the implants.  At that point, the wound was copiously irrigated and the device was inflated multiple times.  There was a very good fit and we had a very good result.  At that point, the pump was subsequently placed in the dartos pouch, which already has been created and was copiously irrigated with antibiotic solution.  This was held in place with a Babcock as well not to migrate proximally and attention was then taken to our connection from the reservoir to the pump.  Please also note that before placement of our pump, attention was then taken up to the left lower quadrant where an incision was then made in external oblique aponeurosis, approximately 3 cm dissection down underneath the rectus space was developed for our reservoir device, which was subsequently placed without difficulty and three simple interrupted sutures of #2-0 Vicryl used to close the defect in the rectus and at that point after placement of our pump, the connection was made between the pump and the reservoir without difficulty.  The entire system pump and corporal bodies were subsequently flushed and all air bubbles were evacuated.  After completion of the connection using a straight connector, the prosthesis was inflated and we had very good results with air inflation with good erection in both cylinders with a very slight deviation to the left, but this was able to be ________ with good cosmetic result.  At that point, after irrigation again of the space, the area was simply dry and hemostatic.  The soft tissue was reapproximated to separate the cylinder so as not to lie in rope against one another and the wound was closed in multiple layers.  The soft tissue and the skin was then reapproximated with staples.  Please also note that prior to the skin closure, a Jackson-Pratt drain was subsequently placed through the left skin and left lower quadrant and subsequently placed just over tubings, would be left in place for approximately 12 to 20 hours.  This was also sutured in place with nylon.  Sterile dressing was applied.  Light gauze was wrapped around the penis and/or sutures that begin at the tip of the glans penis were subsequently cut and removed in entirety bilaterally.  Coban was used then to wrap the penis and at the end of the case the patient was straight catheted, approximately 400 cc of amber-yellow urine.  No Foley catheter was used or placed.,The patient was awoken in the operative suite, extubated, and transferred to recovery room in stable condition.

The patient healed status post rhinoplasty as a result but was left with a persistent saddle-nose dorsal defect.  The patient was consented for the above-stated procedure.  The risks, benefits, and alternatives were discussed.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: ,The patient was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  The patient did have approximately 12 mL of Lidocaine with epinephrine 1% with 1:100,000 infiltrated into the nasal soft tissues.  In addition to this, cocaine pledgets were placed to assist with hemostasis.,At this point, attention was turned to the left ear.  Approximately 3 mL of 1% Lidocaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine was infiltrated into the subcutaneous tissues of the conchal bulb.  Betadine was utilized for preparation.  A 15 blade was used to incise along the posterior conchal area and a Freer elevator was utilized to lift the soft tissues off the conchal cartilage in a submucoperichondrial plane.  I then completed this along the posterior aspect of the conchal cartilage, was transected in the concha cavum and concha cymba, both were harvested.  These were placed aside in saline.  Hemostasis was obtained with bipolar electrocauterization.  Bovie electrocauterization was also employed as needed.  The entire length of the wound was then closed with 5-0 plain running locking suture.  The patient then had a Telfa placed both anterior and posterior to the conchal defect and placed in a sandwich dressing utilizing a 2-0 Prolene suture.  Antibiotic ointment was applied generously.,Next, attention was turned to opening and lifting the soft tissues of the nose.  A typical external columella inverted V gull-wing incision was placed on the columella and trailed into a marginal incision.  The soft tissues of the nose were then elevated using curved sharp scissors and Metzenbaums.  Soft tissues were elevated over the lower lateral cartilages, upper lateral cartilages onto the nasal dorsum.  At this point, attention was turned to osteotomies and examination of the external cartilages.,The patient did have very broad lower lateral cartilages leading to a bulbous tip.  The lower lateral cartilages were trimmed in a symmetrical fashion leaving at least 8 mm of lower lateral cartilage bilaterally along the lateral aspect.  Having completed this, the patient had medial and lateral osteotomies performed with a 2-mm osteotome.  These were done transmucosally after elevating the tract using a Cottle elevator.  Direct hemostasis pressure was applied to assist with bruising.,Next, attention was turned to tip mechanisms.  The patient had a series of double-dome sutures placed into the nasal tip.  Then, 5-0 Dexon was employed for intradomal suturing, 5-0 clear Prolene was used for interdomal suturing.  Having completed this, a 5-0 clear Prolene alar spanning suture was employed to narrow the superior tip area.,Next, attention was turned to dorsal augmentation.  A Gore-Tex small implant had been selected, previously incised.  This was taken to the back table and carved under sterile conditions.  The patient then had the implant placed into the super-tip area to assist with support of the nasal dorsum.  It was placed into a precise pocket and remained in the midline.,Next, attention was turned to performing a columella strut.  The cartilage from the concha was shaped into a strut and placed into a precision pocket between the medial footplate of the lower lateral cartilage.  This was fixed into position utilizing a 5-0 Dexon suture.,Having completed placement of all augmentation grafts, the patient was examined for hemostasis.  The external columella inverted gull-wing incision along the nasal tip was closed with a series of interrupted everting 6-0 black nylon sutures.  The entire marginal incisions for cosmetic rhinoplasty were closed utilizing a series of 5-0 plain interrupted sutures.,At the termination of the case, the ear was inspected and the position of the conchal cartilage harvest was hemostatic.  There was no evidence of hematoma, and the patient had a series of brown Steri-Strips and Aquaplast cast placed over the nasal dorsum.

Right ovarian mass.,3.  8 cm x 10 cm right ovarian cyst with ovarian torsion.,PROCEDURE PERFORMED:  ,Laparoscopic right salpingooophorectomy.,ANESTHESIA:  ,General with endotracheal tube.,COMPLICATIONS: , None.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: , Less than 50 cc.,TUBES: , None.,DRAINS:,  None.,PATHOLOGY: , The right tube and ovary sent to pathology for review.,FINDINGS: , On exam under anesthesia, a normal-appearing vulva and vagina and normally palpated cervix, a uterus that was normal size, and a large right adnexal mass.  Laparoscopic findings demonstrated a 8 cm x 10 cm smooth right ovarian cyst that was noted to be torsed twice.  Otherwise, the uterus, left tube and ovary, bowel, liver margins, appendix, and gallbladder were noted all to be within normal limits.  There was no noted blood in the pelvis.,INDICATIONS FOR THIS PROCEDURE:,  The patient is a 26-year-old G1 P1 who presented to ABCD General Emergency Room with complaint of right lower quadrant pain since last night, which has been increasing in intensity.  The pain persisted despite multiple pain medications given in the Emergency Room.  The patient reports positive nausea and vomiting.  There was no vaginal bleeding or discharge.  There was no fevers or chills.  Her cultures done in the Emergency Room were pending.  The patient did have an ultrasound that demonstrated an 8 cm right ovarian cyst, questionable hemorrhagic.  The uterus and left ovary were within normal limits.  There was a positive flow noted to bilateral ovaries on ultrasound.  Therefore, it was felt appropriate to take the patient for a diagnostic laparoscopy with a possible oophorectomy.,PROCEDURE:,  After informed consent was obtained, and all questions were answered to the patient's satisfaction in layman's terms, she was taken to the operating room where general anesthesia was obtained without any difficulty.  She was placed in dorsal lithotomy position with the use of Allis strips and prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  Her bladder was drained with a red Robinson catheter and she was examined under anesthesia and was noted to have the findings as above.  She was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  A weighted speculum was placed in the patient's vagina with excellent visualization of the cervix.  The cervix was grasped at 12 o'clock position with a single-toothed tenaculum and pulled into the operative field.  The uterus was then sounded to approximately 3.5 inches and then a uterine elevator was placed.  The vulsellum tenaculum was removed.  The weighted speculum was removed.  Attention was then turned to the abdomen where 1 cm infraumbilical incision was made in the infraumbilical fold.  The Veress step needle was then placed into the abdomen while the abdomen was being tented up with towel clamp.  The CO2 was then turned on with unoccluded flow and excellent pressures.  This was continued till a normal symmetrical pneumoperitoneum was obtained.  Then, a #11 mm step trocar and sleeve were placed into the infraumbilical port without any difficulty and placement was confirmed by laparoscope.  Laparoscopic findings are as noted above.  A suprapubic incision was made with the knife and then a #12 mm step trocar and sleeve were placed in the suprapubic region under direct visualization.  Then, a grasper was used to untorse the ovary.  Then, a #12 mm port was placed in the right flank region under direct visualization using a LigaSure vessel sealing system.  The right tube and ovary were amputated and noted to be hemostatic.  The EndoCatch bag was then placed through the suprapubic port and the ovary was placed into the bag.  The ovary was too large to fit completely into the bag.  Therefore, a laparoscopic needle with a 60 cc syringe was used to aspirate the contents of the ovary while it was still inside the bag.,There was approximately 200 cc of fluid aspirated from the cyst.  This was a clear yellow fluid.  Then, the bag was closed and the ovary was removed from the suprapubic port.  The suprapubic port did have to be extended somewhat to allow for the removal of the ovary.  The trocar and sleeve were then placed back into the port.  The abdomen was copiously irrigated with warm normal saline using the Nezhat-Dorsey suction irrigator and the incision site was noted to be hemostatic.  The pelvis was clear and clean.  ,Pictures were obtained.  The suprapubic port was then removed under direct visualization and then using a #0-vicyrl and UR6.  Two figure-of-eight sutures were placed in the fascia of suprapubic port and fascia was closed and the pneumoperitoneum was maintained after the sutures were placed.  Therefore, the peritoneal surface was noted to be hemostatic.  Therefore, the camera was removed.  All instruments were removed.  The abdomen was allowed to completely deflate and then the trocars were placed back through the sleeves of the right flank #12 port and the infraumbilical port and these were removed.  The infraumbilical port was examined and noted to have a small fascial defect which was repaired with #0-Vicryl and UR6.  The right flank area was palpated and there was no facial defect noted.  The skin was then closed with #4-0 undyed Vicryl in subcuticular fashion.  Dressings were changed.  The weighted speculum was removed from the patient's cervix.  The cervix noted to be hemostatic.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  Sponge, lap, and needle counts were correct x2 and the patient was taken to the Recovery in stable condition.\",\n",
       " \"HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , I was kindly asked to see this patient for transesophageal echocardiogram performance by Dr. A and Neurology.  Please see also my cardiovascular consultation dictated separately.  But essentially, this is a pleasant 72-year-old woman admitted to the hospital with a large right MCA CVA causing a left-sided neurological deficit incidentally found to have atrial fibrillation on telemetry.  She has been recommended for a transesophageal echocardiogram for cardioembolic source of her CNS insult.,I discussed the procedure in detail with the patient as well as with her daughter, who was present at the patient's bedside with the patient's verbal consent.  I then performed a risk/benefit/alternative analysis with benefits being more definitive exclusion of intracardiac thrombus as well as assessment for intracardiac shunts; alternatives being transthoracic echo imaging, which she had already had, with an inherent false negativity for this indication as well as empiric medical management, which the patient was not interested in; risks including, but not limited to, and the patient was aware this was not an all-inclusive list, of oversedation from conscious sedation, risk of aspiration pneumonia from regurgitation of stomach contents, risk of oropharyngeal, esophageal, oral, tracheal, pulmonary and/or gastric perforation, hemorrhage, or tear.  The patient expressed understanding of this risk/benefit/alternative analysis, had the opportunity to ask questions, which I invited from her and her daughter, all of which were answered to their self-stated satisfaction.  The patient then stated in a clear competent and coherent fashion that she wished to go forward with the transesophageal echocardiogram.,PROCEDURE: , The appropriate time-out procedure was performed as per Medical Center protocol under my direct supervision with appropriate identification of the patient, position, physician, procedure documentation; there were no safety issues identified by staff nor myself.  She received 20 cc of viscous lidocaine for topical oral anesthetic effect.  She received a total of 4 mg of Versed and 100 micrograms of fentanyl utilizing titrated conscious sedation with continuous hemodynamic and oximetric monitoring with reasonable effect.  The multi-plane probe was passed using digital guidance for several passes, after an oral bite block had been put into place for protection of oral dentition.  This was placed into the posterior oropharynx and advanced into the esophagus, then advanced into the stomach and then rotated and withdrawn and removed with adequate imaging obtained throughout.  She was recovered as per the Medical Center conscious sedation protocol, and there were no apparent complications of the procedure.,FINDINGS: , Normal left ventricular size and systolic function.  LVEF of 60%.  Mild left atrial enlargement.  Normal right atrial size.  Normal right ventricular size and systolic function.  No left ventricular wall motion abnormalities identified.  The four pulmonary veins are identified.  The left atrial appendage is interrogated, including with Doppler and color flow, and while there is good to-and-fro motion seen, echo smoke is seen, and in fact, an intracardiac thrombus is identified and circumscribed at 1.83 cm in circumference at the base of the left atrial appendage.  No intracardiac vegetations nor endocarditis seen on any of the intracardiac valves.  The mitral valve is seen.  There is mild mitral regurgitation with two jets.  No mitral stenosis.  Four pulmonary veins were identified without reversible pulmonary venous flow.  There are three cusps of the aortic valve seen.  No aortic stenosis.  There is trace aortic insufficiency.  There is trace pulmonic insufficiency.  The pulmonary artery is seen and is within normal limits.  There is trace to mild tricuspid regurgitation.  Unable to estimate PA systolic pressure accurately; however, on the recent transthoracic echocardiogram (which I would direct the reader to) on January 5, 2010, RVSP was calculated at 40 mmHg on that study.  E wave velocity on average is 0.95 m/sec with a deceleration time of 232 milliseconds.  The proximal aorta is within normal limits, annulus 1.19 cm, sinuses of Valsalva 2.54 cm, ascending aorta 2.61 cm.  The intra-atrial septum is identified as are the SVC and IVC, and these are within normal limits.  The intra-atrial septum is interrogated with color flow as well as agitated D5W and there is no evidence of intracardiac shunting, including no atrial septal defect nor patent foramen ovale.  No pericardial effusion.  There is mild nonmobile descending aortic atherosclerosis seen.,IMPRESSION:,1.  Normal left ventricular size and systolic function.  Left ventricular ejection fraction visually estimated at 60% without regional wall motion abnormalities.,2.  Mild left atrial enlargement.,3.  Intracardiac thrombus identified at the base of the left atrial appendage.,4.  Mild mitral regurgitation with two jets.,5.

       " \"CHIEF COMPLAINT:,  Intractable epilepsy, here for video EEG.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , The patient is a 9-year-old male who has history of global developmental delay and infantile spasms.  Ultimately, imaging study shows an MRI with absent genu of the corpus callosum and thinning of the splenium of the corpus callosum, showing a pattern of cerebral dysgenesis.  He has had severe global developmental delay, and is nonverbal.  He can follow objects with his eyes, but has no ability to interact with his environment to any great degree.  He has noted if any purposeful use of the hands.  He has abnormal movements constantly, which are more choreiform and dystonic.  He has spastic quadriparesis, which is variable at times.  The patient is unable to sit or stand, and receives all his nutrition via G-tube.,The patient began having seizures in infancy presenting as infantile spasms.  I began seeing him at 20 months of age.  At that point, he had undergone workup in Seattle, Washington and then was seeing Dr. X, child neurologist in Mexico, who started Vigabatrin for infantile spasms.  The patient had benefit from this medication, and was doing well at that time with regard to that seizure type.  He initially was on phenobarbital, which failed to give him benefit.  He continued on phenobarbital; however, for a long period time thereafter.  The patient then began having more tonic seizures after his episodic spasms had subsided, and failed several medication trials including valproic acid, Topamax, and Zonegran at least briefly.  Upon starting Lamictal, he began to have benefit and then actually had 1-year seizure freedom before having an isolated seizure or 2.  Over the next 6 months to a year, he only had few further seizures, and was doing well in a general sense.  It was more recently that he began having new seizure events that have not responded to higher doses of Lamictal up to 15 mg/kg/day.  These events manifest as tonic spells with eye deviation and posturing.  Mother reports flexion of the upper extremities, extension with lower extremities.  During that time, he is not able to cry or say any sounds.  These events last from seconds to minutes, and occur at least multiple times per week.  There are times where he has none for a few days and other times where he has multiple days in a row with events.  He has another event manifesting as flexion of the upper extremities and extension lower extremities where he turns red and cries throughout.  He may vomit after these episodes, then seems to calm down.  It is unclear whether this is a seizure or whether the patient is still responsive.,MEDICATIONS:,  The patient's medications include Lamictal for a total of 200 mg twice a day.  It is a 150 mg tablet and 25 mg tablets.  He is on Zonegran using 25 mg capsules 2 capsules twice daily, and baclofen 10 mg three times day.  He has other medications including the Xopenex and Atrovent.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: , At this time is negative any fevers, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal complaints, rashes, arthritis, or arthralgias.  No respiratory or cardiovascular complaints.  He has no change in his skills at this point.,FAMILY HISTORY: , Noncontributory.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,GENERAL:  The patient is a slender male who is microcephalic.  He has EEG electrodes in place and is on the video EEG at that time.,HEENT:  His oropharynx shows no lesions.,NECK:  Supple without adenopathy.,CHEST:  Clear to auscultation.,CARDIOVASCULAR:  Regular rate and rhythm.  No murmurs.,ABDOMEN:  Benign with G-tube in place.,EXTREMITIES:  Reveal no clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.,NEUROLOGICAL:  The patient is alert and has bilateral esotropia.  He is able to fix and follow objects briefly.  He is unable to reach for objects.  He exhibits constant choreiform movements when excited.  These are more prominent in the upper extremities and lower extremities.  He has some dystonic posture with flexion of the wrist and fingers bilaterally.  He also has plantar flexion at the ankles bilaterally.  His cranial nerves reveal that his pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light.  Extraocular movements are intact other than bilateral esotropia.  His face moves symmetrically.  Palate elevates in midline.  Hearing appears intact bilaterally.,Motor exam reveals dystonic and variable tone, overall there is mild in spasticity both upper and lower extremities as described above.  He has clonus at the ankles bilaterally, and some valgus contracture of the ankles.  His sensation is intact to light touch bilaterally.  Deep tendon reflexes are 2 to 3+ bilaterally.,IMPRESSION/PLAN: , This is a 9-year-old male with congenital brain malformation and intractable epilepsy.  He has microcephaly as well as dystonic cerebral palsy.  He had a re-emergence of seizures, which are difficult to classify, although some sound like tonic episodes and others are more concerning for non-epileptic phenomenon, such as discomfort.  He is admitted for video EEG to hopefully capture both of these episodes and further clarify the seizure type or types.  He will remain hospitalized for probably at least 48 hours to 72 hours.  He could be discharged sooner if multiple events are captured.  His medications, we will continue his current dose of Zonegran and Lamictal for now.  Both of these medications are very long acting, discontinuing them while in the hospital may simply result in severe seizures after discharge.\",\n",

Microscopic-assisted lumbar laminectomy with discectomy at L5-S1 on the left on 08/28/03.,BLOOD LOSS: , Approximately 25 cc.,ANESTHESIA: , General.,POSITION:,  Prone on the Jackson table.,INTRAOPERATIVE FINDINGS:,  Extruded nucleus pulposus at the level of L5-S1.,HISTORY: , This is a 34-year-old male with history of back pain with radiation into the left leg in the S1 nerve root distribution.  The patient was lifting at work on 08/27/03 and felt immediate sharp pain from his back down to the left lower extremity.  He denied any previous history of back pain or back surgeries.  Because of his intractable pain as well as severe weakness in the S1 nerve root distribution, the patient was aware of all risks as well as possible complications of this type of surgery and he has agreed to pursue on.  After an informed consent was obtained, all risks as well as complications were discussed with the patient.  ,PROCEDURE DETAIL:  ,He was wheeled back to Operating Room #5 at ABCD General Hospital on 08/28/03.  After a general anesthetic was administered, a Foley catheter was inserted.,The patient was then turned prone on the Jackson table.  All of his bony prominences were well-padded.  At this time, a myelogram was then performed.  After the lumbar spine was prepped, a #20 gauge needle was then used to perform a myelogram.  The needle was localized to the level of L3-L4 region.  Once inserted into the thecal sac, we immediately got cerebrospinal fluid through the spinal needle.  At this time, approximately 10 cc of Conray injected into the thecal sac.  The patient was then placed in the reversed Trendelenburg position in order to assist with distal migration of the contrast.  The myelogram did reveal that there was some space occupying lesion, most likely disc at the level of L5-S1 on the left.  There was a lack of space filling defect on the left evident on both the AP and the lateral projections using C-arm fluoroscopy.  At this point, the patient was then fully prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion for this procedure for a microdiscectomy.  A long spinal needle was then inserted into region of surgery on the right.  The surgery was going to be on the left.  Once the spinal needle was inserted, a localizing fluoroscopy was then used to assure appropriate location and this did confirm that we were at the L5-S1 nerve root region.  At this time, an approximately 2 cm skin incision was made over the lumbar region, dissected down to the deep lumbar fascia.  At this time, a Weitlaner was inserted.  Bovie cautery was used to obtain hemostasis.  We further continued through the deep lumbar fascia and dissected off the short lumbar muscles off of the spinous process and the lamina.  A Cobb elevator was then used to elevate subperiosteally off of all the inserting short lumbar muscles off of the spinous process as well as the lamina on the left-hand side.  At this time, a Taylor retractor was then inserted and held there for retraction.  Suction as well as Bovie cautery was used to obtain hemostasis.  At this time, a small Kerrison Rongeur was used to make a small lumbar laminotomy to expose our window for the nerve root decompression.  Once the laminotomy was performed, a small _______ curette was used to elevate the ligamentum flavum off of the thecal sac as well as the adjoining nerve roots.  Once the ligamentum flavum was removed, we immediately identified a piece of disc material floating around outside of the disc space over the S1 nerve root, which was compressive.  We removed the extruded disc with further freeing up of the S1 nerve root.  A nerve root retractor was then placed.  Identification of disc space was then performed.  A #15 blade was then inserted and small a key hole into the disc space was then performed with a #15 blade.  A small pituitary was then inserted within the disc space and more disc material was freed and removed.  The part of the annulus fibrosis were also removed in addition to the loose intranuclear pieces of disc.  Once this was performed, we removed the retraction off the nerve root and the nerve root appeared to be free with pulsatile visualization of the vasculature indicating that the nerve root was essentially free.,At this time, copious irrigation was used to irrigate the wound.  We then performed another look to see if any loose pieces of disc were extruding from the disc space and only small pieces were evident and they were then removed with the pituitary rongeur.  At this time, a small piece of Gelfoam was then used to cover the exposed nerve root.  We did not have any dural leaks during this case.  #1-0 Vicryl was then used to approximate the deep lumbar fascia, #2-0 Vicryl was used to approximate the superficial lumbar fascia, and #4-0 running Vicryl for the subcutaneous skin.  Sterile dressings were then applied.  The patient was then carefully slipped over into the supine position, extubated and transferred to Recovery in stable condition.  At this time, we are still waiting to assess the patient postoperatively to assure no neurological sequela postsurgically are found and also to assess his pain level.',\n",

The arm was exsanguinated.  The tourniquet was elevated at 290 mmHg.  Construction lines were made on the left palm to identify the ring ray.  A transverse incision was made in the palm between FCR and FCU, one finger breadth proximal to the interval between the glabrous skin of the palm and normal forearm skin.  Blunt dissection exposed the antebrachial fascia.  Hemostasis was obtained with bipolar cautery.  A distal based window in the antebrachial fascia was then fashioned.  Care was taken to protect the underlying contents.  A synovial elevator was used to palpate the undersurface of the transverse carpal ligament, and synovium was elevated off this undersurface.,Hamate sounds were then used to palpate the Hood of Hamate.  The Agee Inside Job was then inserted into the proximal incision.  The transverse carpal ligament was easily visualized through the portal.  Using palmar pressure, transverse carpal ligament was held against the portal as the instrument was inserted down the transverse carpal ligament to the distal end.  The distal end of the transverse carpal ligament was then identified in the window.  The blade was then elevated, and the Agee Inside Job was withdrawn, dividing transverse carpal ligament under direct vision.  After complete division of transverse carpal ligament, the Agee Inside Job was reinserted.  Radial and ulnar edges of the transverse carpal ligament were identified and complete release was accomplished.  One cc of Celestone was then introduced into the carpal tunnel and irrigated free.  ,The wound was then closed with a running 3-0 Prolene subcuticular stitch.  Steri-strips were applied and a sterile dressing was applied over the Steri-strips.  The tourniquet was deflated.  The patient was awakened from anesthesia and returned to the recovery room in satisfactory condition having tolerated the procedure well.',\n",

After general anesthesia was achieved by the anesthesia team, the above-mentioned anesthetic mixture was infiltrated directly into the patient's left foot to anesthetize the future surgical sites.  The left ankle was covered with cast padding and an 18-inch ankle tourniquet was placed around the left ankle and set at 250 mmHg.  The left foot was then prepped, scrubbed, and draped in normal sterile technique.  The left ankle tourniquet was then inflated.  Attention was then directed on the dorsal aspect of the first left metatarsal shaft where an 8-cm linear incision was placed directly parallel and medial to the course of the extensor hallucis longus tendon.  The incision extended from the base of the first left metatarsal all the way to the first left metatarsophalangeal joint.  The incision was deepened through subcutaneous tissues.  All the bleeders were identified, cut, clamped, and cauterized.  The incision was deepened to the level of the periosteum of the first left metatarsal.  All the tendinous neurovascular structures were identified and retracted from the site to be preserved.  Using sharp and dull dissection, the periosteal tissues were mobilized from their attachments on the first left metatarsal shaft.  Dissection was carried down to the level of the lose screw fixation and the two screws were identified and removed intact.  The screws were sent to pathology for examination.  The nonunion was also identified closer to the base of the first left metatarsal and using the sagittal saw the nonunion and some of the healthy tissue on both ends of the previous osteotomy were resected and sent to pathology for identification.  The remaining two ends of the previous osteotomy were then fenestrated with the use of a 0.045 Kirschner wire to induce bleeding.  The corticocancellous bone graft was prepped according to the instructions in saline for at least 60 minutes and then interposed in the previous area of the osteotomy.  Provisional fixation with K-wires was achieved and also correction of the bunion deformity of the first left metatarsophalangeal joint was also accomplished.  The bone graft was then stabilized with the use of a T-type prebent plate with the use of fixed screws that were inserted using AO technique through the plate and the shaft of the first left metatarsal and compressed appropriately the graft.  Removal of the K-wires and examination of fixation and graft incorporation into the previous nonunion area was found to be excellent.  The area was flushed copiously flushed with saline.  The periosteal and capsular tissues were approximated with 3-0 Vicryl and 2-0 Vicryl suture material.  All the subcutaneous tissues were approximated with 4-0 Vicryl suture material and 5-0 Prolene was used to approximate the skin edges at this time.  The left ankle tourniquet was deflated.  Immediate hyperemia was noted to the entire left lower extremity upon deflation of the cuff.  The patient's incision was covered with Xeroform, copious amounts of fluff and Kling, stockinette, and Ace bandage.  The patient's left foot was placed in a surgical shoe.,The patient was then transferred to the postanesthesia care unit with his vital signs stable and the vascular status at appropriate levels.  The patient was given specific instructions and education on how to continue caring for his left foot surgery.

The resting echocardiogram showed a severe decrease in her left ventricular systolic function with a reported LVEF of 20% to 25%.  This was a sharp decline from a previous LVEF of 50% to 55%.  We therefore, decided to proceed with coronary angiography.,TECHNIQUE: , After obtaining informed consent, the patient was brought to the cardiac catheterization suite in post-absorptive and non-sedated state.  The right groin was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.  2% Lidocaine was used for infiltration anesthesia.  Using modified Seldinger technique, a 6-French sheath was introduced into the right femoral artery.  6-French JL4 and JR4 diagnostic catheters were used to perform the left and right coronary angiogram.  A 6-French pigtail catheter was used to perform the LV-gram in the RAO projection.,HEMODYNAMIC DATA: , LVEDP of 11.

The left main coronary artery is a very short vessel and immediately bifurcates into the left anterior descending artery and the left circumflex coronary artery.,2.  The left main coronary artery is free of any disease.,3.  The left circumflex coronary artery which is a nondominant vessel gives off 2 marginal branches.  The first marginal branch is very small in caliber and runs a fairly long course and is free of any disease.,4.  The second marginal branch which is actually a continuation of the left circumflex coronary artery gives off several secondary branches.  One of its secondary branches which is a small caliber has an ostial 70% stenosis.,5.  The left anterior descending artery has a patent stent in the proximal LAD.  The second stent which is overlapping the junction of the mid and distal left anterior descending artery has mild late luminal loss.  There appears to be 30% narrowing involving the distal cuff segment of the stent in the distal left anterior descending artery.  The diagonal branches are free of any disease.,6.  The right coronary artery is a dominant vessel and has mild luminal irregularities.  Its midsegment has a focal area of 30% narrowing as well.  The rest of the right coronary artery is free of any disease.,7.  The LV-gram performed in the RAO projection shows well preserved left ventricular systolic function with an estimated LVEF of 55%.,RECOMMENDATION: , Continue with optimum medical therapy.  Because of the discrepancy between the left ventriculogram EF assessment and the echocardiographic EF assessment, I have discussed this matter with Dr. XYZ and we have decided to proceed with a repeat 2D echocardiogram.

Note that previously the patient was found to have some baseline dementia, although slight.  The patient was seen and evaluated by the neurology team, who cleared the patient for surgery.  The patient was taken to the operating room and general endotracheal anesthesia was administered.  The abdomen was prepped and draped in the standard surgical fashion.  We first began our dissection by using a #10-blade scalpel to incise the skin over the femoral artery in the groin bilaterally.  Dissection was carried down to the level of the femoral vessels using Bovie electrocautery.  The common femoral, superficial femoral, and profunda femoris arteries were encircled and dissected out peripherally.  Vessel loops were placed around the aforementioned arteries.  After doing so, we turned our attention to beginning our abdominal dissection.  We used a #10-blade scalpel to make a midline laparotomy incision.  Dissection was carried down to the level of the fascia using Bovie electrocautery.  The abdomen was opened and an Omni retractor was positioned.  The aorta was dissected out in the abdomen.  The left femoral vein was identified.  There was a nicely clampable portion of aorta visible.  We, as mentioned, placed our Omni retractor and then turned our attention to performing our anastomosis.  Full-dose heparin was given.  Next, vascular clamps were applied to the iliac vessels as well as to the proximal aorta just below the renal vessels.  A #11-blade scalpel was used to make an arteriotomy in the aorta, which was lengthened both proximally and distally using Potts scissors.  We then beveled our proximal graft and constructed an end graft-to-side artery anastomosis using 3-0 Prolene in a running fashion.  Upon completion of our anastomosis, we flushed our graft and noted there was no evidence of a leak from the newly constructed anastomosis.  We then created our tunnels over the iliac vessels.  We pulled the distal limbs over our ABF graft into the groin.  We then proceeded to perform our right anastomosis first.  We applied vascular clamps on the proximal common femoral, profunda, and superficial femoral arteries.  We incised the common femoral artery and lengthened our arteriotomy in the vessel both proximally and distally.  We then footed the graft down onto the common femoral artery to the level of the SFA and constructed our anastomosis using 6-0 Prolene in a running fashion.  Upon completion of our anastomosis, we flushed the common femoral, SFA, and profunda femoris arteries.  We then removed our clamp.  We opened the limb more proximally in the abdomen on the right side.  We then turned our attention to the left side and similarly placed our vascular clamps.  We used a #11-blade scalpel to make an arteriotomy in the vessel.  We then lengthened our arteriotomy both proximally and distally again onto the SFA.  We constructed a footed end graft-to-side artery anastomosis using 6-0 Prolene in a running fashion.  Upon completion of our anastomosis, we opened our clamps.  There was no noticeable leak from the newly constructed anastomosis.  We checked our proximal graft to aortic anastomosis, which was noted to be in good condition.  We then gave full-dose protamine.

Lidocaine 2 mL was then filled locally.  The right femoral artery was cannulated with an 18-guage needle followed by a 6-French vascular sheath.  A guiding catheter XB 3.5 was advanced in manipulated to cannulate the left coronary artery and angiography was obtained.  A confirmed occlusion of the left anterior descending artery with minimal collaterals and also occlusion of the right coronary artery, which is well collateralized.  An angioplasty wire with present wire was advanced into the left anterior descending artery, and could cross the area of occlusion within the stent.  An angioplasty balloon measuring 2.0 x 15 was advanced and three inflations were obtained.  It successfully re-canalized the artery.  There is evidence of residual stenosis within the distal aspect of the previous stents.  A drug-eluting stent Xience 2.75 x 15 was advanced and positioned within the area of stenosis with its distal marker adjacent to bifurcation with a diagonal branch and was deployed at 12 and 18 atmospheres.  The intermittent result was improved.  An additional inflation was obtained more proximally.  His blood pressure fluctuated and dropped in the 70s, correlating with additional sedation.  There is patency of the left anterior descending artery and good antegrade flow.  The guiding catheter was replaced with a 5-French Judkins right catheter manipulated to cannulate the right coronary artery and selective angiography was obtained.  The catheter was then advanced into the left ventricle and pressure measurement was obtained including pullback across the aortic valve.  The right femoral vein was cannulated with an 18-guage needle followed by an 8-French vascular sheath.  A 8-French Swan-Ganz catheter was then advanced under fluoroscopic and hemodynamic control and pressure stenting was obtained from the right ventricle, pulmonary artery, and pulmonary capillary wedge position.

Endotracheal intubation carried out by Dr. X. The patient's right ear was carefully prepped and then draped in the usual sterile fashion.  Slow infiltration of the external canal accomplished with 1% Xylocaine with epinephrine.  The earlobe was also infiltrated with the same solution.  A limited incision was made in the earlobe harvesting a small bit of fat from the earlobe that was diced and the donor site closed with interrupted sutures of 5-0 nylon.  This could later be removed in bishop.  A reinspection of the ear canal was accomplished.  A 65 Beaver blade was used to make incision both at 12 o'clock and at 6 o'clock.  Jordan round knife was used to incise the tympanomeatal flap with an adequate cuff for later reapproximation.  Elevation was carried down to the fibrous annulus.  An annulus elevator was used to complete the elevation beneath the annular ligament.  The tympanic membrane and the associated flap rotated anteriorly exposing the ossicular chain.  Palpation of the malleus revealed good mobility of both it and incus, but no movement of the stapes was identified.  Palpation with a fine curved needle on the stapes itself revealed no movement.  A house curette was used to takedown portions of the scutum with extreme care to avoid any inadvertent trauma to the chorda tympani.  The nerve was later hydrated with a small curved needle and an additional fluid to try to avoid inadvertent desiccation of it as well.  The self-retaining speculum holder was used to get secure visibility and argon laser then used to create rosette on the posterior cruse.  The stapes superstructure anteriorly was mobilized with a right angle hook at the incostapedial joint and the superstructure could then be downfractured.  The fenestration created in the footplate was nearly perfect for placement of the piston and therefore additional laser vaporization was not required in this particular situation.  A small bit of additional footplate was removed with a right angle hook to accommodate the 0.6 mm piston.  The measuring device was used and a 4.25 mm slim shaft wire Teflon piston chosen.  It was placed in the middle ear atraumatically with a small alligator forceps and was directed towards the fenestration in the footplate.  The hook was placed over the incus and measurement appeared to be appropriate.  A downbiting crimper was then used to complete the attachment of the prosthesis to the incus.  Prosthesis is once again checked for location and centering and appeared to be in ideal position.  Small pledgets of fat were placed around the perimeter of the piston in an attempt to avoid any postoperative drainage of perilymph.  A small pledget of fat was also placed on the top of the incudo-prosthesis junction.  The mobility appeared excellent.  The flap was placed back in its normal anatomic position.  The external canal packed with small pledgets of Gelfoam and antibiotic ointment.  She was then awakened and taken to the recovery room in a stable condition with discharge anticipated later this day to Bishop.  Sutures will be out in a week and a recheck in Reno in four to five weeks from now.\",\n",

The patient had right lower quadrant tenderness with rebound and percussion tenderness in the right lower quadrant.  She had a leukocytosis of 12.8.  She did undergo a CT of the abdomen and pelvis, which was non diagnostic for an acute appendicitis.  Given the severity of her abdominal examination and her persistence of her symptoms, we recommend the patient undergo diagnostic laparoscopy with probable need for laparoscopic appendectomy and possible open appendectomy.  The risks, benefits, complications of the procedure, she gave us informed consent to proceed.,OPERATIVE FINDINGS:  ,Exploration of the abdomen via laparoscopy revealed an appendix with suppurative fluid surrounding it, it was slightly enlarged.  The left ovary revealed some follicular cysts.  There was no evidence of adnexal masses and/or torsion of the fallopian tubes.  The uterus revealed no evidence of mass and/or fibroid tumors.  The remainder of the abdomen was unremarkable.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE: , The patient was brought to the operative suite, placed in the supine position.  The abdomen was prepped and draped in the normal sterile fashion with Betadine solution.  The patient underwent general endotracheal anesthesia.  The patient also received a preoperative dose of Ancef 1 gram IV.  After adequate sedation was achieved, a #10 blade scalpel was used to make an infraumbilical transverse incision utilizing a Veress needle.  Veress needle was inserted into the abdomen and the abdomen was insufflated approximately 15 mmHg.  Once the abdomen was sufficiently insufflated, a 10 mm bladed trocar was inserted into the abdomen without difficulty.  A video laparoscope was inserted into the infraumbilical trocar site and the abdomen was explored.  Next, a 5 mm port was inserted in the midclavicular line of the right upper quadrant region.  This was inserted under direct visualization.  Finally, a suprapubic 12 mm portal was created.  This was performed with #10 blade scalpel to create a transverse incision.  A bladed trocar was inserted into the suprapubic region.  This was done again under direct visualization.  Maryland dissector was inserted into the suprapubic region and a window was created between the appendix and mesoappendix at the base of the cecum.  This was done while the 5 mm trocar was used to grasp the middle portion of the appendix and retracted anteriorly.  Utilizing a endovascular stapling device, the appendix was transected and doubly stapled with this device.  Next, the mesoappendix was doubly stapled and transected with the endovascular stapling device.  The staple line was visualized and there was no evidence of bleeding.  The abdomen was fully irrigated with copious amounts of normal saline.  The abdomen was then aspirated.  There was no evidence of bleeding.  All ports were removed under direct visualization.  No evidence of bleeding from the port sites.  The infraumbilical and suprapubic ports were then closed.  The fascias were then closed with #0-Vicryl suture on a UR6 needle.  Once the fascias were closed, all incisions were closed with #4-0 undyed Vicryl.  The areas were cleaned, Steri-Strips were placed across the wound.  Sterile dressing was applied.,The patient tolerated the procedure well.  She was extubated following the procedure, returned to Postanesthesia Care Unit in stable condition.

She was followed by another rheumatologist.  She says she has been off and on, on prednisone and Arava.  The rheumatologist, as per the patient, would not want her to be on a long-term medicine, so he would give her prednisone and then switch to Arava and then switch her back to prednisone.  She says she had been on prednisone for the last 6 to 9 months.  She is on 5 mg a day.  She recently had a left BKA and there was a question of infection, so it had to be debrided.  I was consulted to see if her prednisone is to be continued.  The patient denies any joint pains at the present time.

She is not on DMARD, but as she recently had a surgery followed by a probable infection, I will hold off on that.  As she has no pain, I have decreased the prednisone to 2.5 mg a day starting tomorrow if she is to go back to her nursing home tomorrow.  If in a couple of weeks her symptoms stay the same, then I would discontinue the prednisone.  I would defer that to Dr. X.  If she flares up at that point, prednisone may have to be restarted with a DMARD, so that eventually she could stay off the prednisone.  I discussed this at length with the patient and she is in full agreement with the plan.  I explained to her that if she is to be discharged, if she wishes, she could follow up with me in clinic or if she goes back to Victoria, then see her rheumatologist over there.',\n",

After adequate sedation was achieved by the anesthesia team, the above-mentioned anesthetic mixture was infiltrated directly into the patient's right foot to anesthetize the future surgical site.  The right ankle was then covered with cast padding and an 18-inch ankle tourniquet was placed around the right ankle and set at 250 mmHg.  The right ankle tourniquet was then inflated.  The right foot was prepped, scrubbed, and draped in normal sterile technique.  Attention was then directed on the dorsal aspect of the first right metatarsophalangeal joint where a 6-cm linear incision was placed just parallel and medial to the course of the extensor hallucis longus to the right great toe.  The incision was deepened through the subcutaneous tissues.  All the bleeders were identified, cut, clamped, and cauterized.  The incision was deepened to the level of the capsule and the periosteum of the first right metatarsophalangeal joint.  All the tendinous and neurovascular structures were identified and retracted from the site to be preserved.  Using sharp and dull dissection, all the capsular and periosteal attachments were mobilized from the base of the proximal phalanx of the right great toe and head of the first right metatarsal.  Once the base of the proximal phalanx of the right great toe and the first right metatarsal head were adequately exposed, multiple osteophytes were encountered.  Gouty tophi were encountered both intraarticularly and periarticularly for the first right metatarsophalangeal joint, which were consistent with a medical history that is positive for gout for this patient.,Using sharp and dull dissection, all the ligamentous and soft tissue attachments were mobilized and the right first metatarsophalangeal joint was freed from all adhesions.  Using the sagittal saw, all the osteophytes were removed from the dorsal, medial, and lateral aspect of the first right metatarsal head as well as the dorsal, medial, and lateral aspect of the base of the proximal phalanx of the right great toe.  Although some improvement of the range of motion was encountered after the removal of the osteophytes, some tightness and restriction was still present.  The decision was thus made to perform a Youngswick-type osteotomy on the head of the first right metatarsal.  The osteotomy consistent of two dorsal cuts and a plantar cut in a V-pattern with the apex of the osteotomy distal and the base of the osteotomy proximal.  The two dorsal cuts were longer than the plantar cut in order to accommodate for the future internal fixation.  The wedge of bone that was formed between the two dorsal cuts was resected and passed off to Pathology for further examination.  The head of the first right metatarsal was then impacted on the shaft of the first right metatarsal and provisionally stabilized with two wires from the OsteoMed System.  The wires were inserted from a dorsal distal to plantar proximal direction through the dorsal osteotomy.  The wires were also used as guidewires for the insertion of two 16-mm proximally threaded cannulated screws from the OsteoMed System.  The 2 screws were inserted using AO technique.  Upon insertion of the screws, the two wires were removed.  Fixation of the osteotomy on the table was found to be excellent.  The area was copiously flushed with saline and range of motion was reevaluated and was found to be much improved from the preoperative levels without any significant restriction.  The cartilaginous surfaces on the base of the first right metatarsal and the base of the proximal phalanx were also fenestrated in order to induce some cartilaginous formation.  The capsule and periosteal tissues were then reapproximated with 3-0 Vicryl suture material, 4-0 Vicryl was used to approximate the subcutaneous tissues.  Steri-Strips were used to approximate and reinforce the skin edges.  At this time, the right ankle tourniquet was deflated.  Immediate hyperemia was noted in the entire right lower extremity upon deflation of the cuff.  The patient's surgical site was then covered with Xeroform, copious amounts of fluff and Kling, stockinette, and Ace bandage.  The patient's right foot was placed in a surgical shoe and the patient was then transferred to the recovery room under the care of the anesthesia team with her vital signs stable and neurovascular status at appropriate levels.  The patient was given instructions and education on how to continue caring for her right foot surgery at home.  The patient was also given pain medication instructions on how to control her postoperative pain.  The patient was eventually discharged from Hospital according to nursing protocol and was advised to follow up with Dr. X's office in one week's time for her first postoperative appointment.\",\n",

However developed progressive problems and he had two additional stents placed with some initial improvement.  Subsequently, he developed progressive airway obstruction and came into the ABC Hospital critical airway service for further evaluation and was admitted on Month DD, YYYY.  He underwent bronchoscopy by Dr. W and found to have an extensive subglottic upper tracheal and distal tracheal stenosis secondary to metallic stent extensive granulation and inflammatory tissue changes.  The patient had some debridement and then was hospitalized and Laryngology and Thoracic Surgery services were consulted for further management.  Exploration of trachea, removal of foreign body stents constricting his airway, dilation and stabilization of his trachea were offered to the patient.  Nature of the proposed procedure including risks and complications of bleeding, infection, alteration of voice, speech, swallowing, voice changes permanently, possibility of tracheotomy temporarily or permanently to maintain his airway, loss of voice, cardiac risk factors, anesthetic risks, recurrence of problems, upon surgical intervention were all discussed at length.  The patient stated that he understood and wished to proceed.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE,The patient was taken to the operating room, placed in the supine position.  Following adequate monitoring by Anesthesia Service to maintain sedation, the patient's neck was prepped and draped in the sterile fashion.  The neck was then infiltrated with 1% Xylocaine and 1000 epinephrine.  A collar incision approximately 1 fingerbreadth above the clavicle, this was an outline incision, was carried out.  The skin, subcutaneous tissue, platysma, subplatysmal flaps elevated superiorly and inferiorly.  Strap muscles were separated in the midline, dissection carried down to visceral fascia.  Beneath the strap muscles, there was dense inflammation scarring obscuring palpable landmarks.  There appeared to be significant scarring fusion of soft tissue at the perichondrium and cartilage of the cricoid making the cricoid easily definable.  There was a markedly enlarged thyroid isthmus.  Thyroid isthmus was divided and dense inflammation, attachment of the thyroid isthmus, fusion of the thyroid gland to the capsule to the pretracheal fascia requiring extensive blunt sharp dissection.  Trachea was exposed from the cricoid to the fourth ring which entered down into the chest.  The trachea was incised between the second and third ring inferior limb in the midline and excision of small ridge of cartilage on each side sent for pathologic evaluation.  The tracheal cartilage externally had marked thickening and significant stiffness calcification, and the tracheal wall from the outside of the trachea to the mucosa measured 3 to 4 mm in thickness.  The trachea was entered and visualized with thickening of the mucosa and submucosa was noted.  The patient, however, was able to ventilate at this point a #6 Endo Tube was inserted and general anesthesia administered.  Once the airway was secured, we then proceeded working around the #6 Endo Tube as well as with the tube intake and out to explore the trachea with ridged fiberoptic scopes as well as flexible fiberoptic bronchoscopy to the trach site.  Examination revealed extrusion of metallic fragments from stent and multiple metallic fragments were removed from the stent in the upper trachea.  A careful examination of the subglottic area showed inflamed and thickened mucosa but patent subglottis.  After removal of the stents and granulation tissue, the upper trachea was widely patent.  The mid trachea had some marked narrowing secondary to granulation.  Stent material was removed from this area as well.  In the distal third of the trachea, a third stent was embedded within the mucosa, not encroaching on the lumen without significant obstruction distally and this was not disturbed at this time.  All visible stent material in the upper and mid trachea were removed.  Initial attempt to place a #16 Montgomery T tube showed the distal lumen of the T tube to be too short to stent the granulation narrowing of the trachea at the junction of the anterior two thirds and the distal third.  Also, this was removed and a #8 Shiley single cannula tracheostomy tube was placed after removal of the endotracheal tube.  A good ventilation was confirmed and the position of the tube confirmed it to be at the level just above the metallic stent which was embedded in the mucosa.  The distal trachea and mainstem bronchi were widely patent.  This secured his airway and no further manipulation felt to be needed at this time.  Neck wound was thoroughly irrigated and strap muscles were closed with interrupted 3-0 Vicryl.  The skin laterally to the trach site was closed with running 2-0 Prolene.  Tracheostomy tube was secured with interrupted 2-0 silk sutures and the patient was taken back to the Intensive Care Unit in satisfactory condition.  The patient tolerated the procedure well without complication.\",\n",

It was subsequently obstructed with multiple episodes of pyelonephritis, two percutaneous tube placements, ureteroscopy with balloon dilation of the system, and continued obstruction.  Plan is for co surgeons due to the complexity of the situation and the solitary kidney to do surgical procedure to correct the obstruction.,DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION:  ,The patient was taken to the operative room.  Surgical consent, operative site, and patient identification were verified.  Dr. X and Dr. Y both agreed upon the procedures in advance.  Dr. Y then, once the patient was anesthetized, requested IV antibiotics with Fortaz, the patient had a caudal block placed, and he was then placed in lithotomy position.  Dr. Y then calibrated the urethra with the bougie a boule to 8, 10, and up to 12 French.  The 9.5-French cystoscope sheath was then placed within the patient's bladder with the offset scope, and his bladder had no evidence of cystitis.  I was able to locate the ureteral orifice bilaterally, although no urine coming from the right.  We then placed a 4-French ureteral catheter into the ureter as far as we could go.  An antegrade nephrostogram was then performed, which shows that the contrast filled the dilated pelvis, but did not go into the ureter.  A retrograde was performed, and it was found that there was a narrowed band across the two.  Upon draining the ureter allowing to drain to gravity, the pelvis which had been clamped and its nephrostomy tube did not drain at all.  Dr. Y then placed a 0.035 guidewire into the ureter after removing the 4-French catheter and then placed a 4.7-French double-J catheter into the ureter as far as it would go allowing it to coil in the bladder.  Once this was completed, we then removed the cystoscope and sheath, placed a 10-French Foley catheter, and the patient was positioned by Dr. X and Dr. Y into the flank position with the left flank up after adequate padding on the arms and legs as well as a brachial plexus roll.  He was then sterilely prepped and draped.  Dr. Y then incised the skin with a 15-blade knife through the old incision and then extended the incision with curved mosquito clamp and Dr. X performed cautery of the areas advanced to be excised.  Once this was then dissected, Dr. Y and Dr. X divided the lumbosacral fascia; at the latissimus dorsi fascia, posterior dorsal lumbotomy maneuver using the electrocautery; and then using curved mosquito clamps __________.  At this point, Dr. X used the cautery to enter the posterior retroperitoneal space through the posterior abdominal fascia.  Dr. Y then used the curved right angle clamp and dissected around towards the ureter, which was markedly adherent to the base of the retroperitoneum.  Dr. X and Dr. Y also needed dissection on the medial and lateral aspects with Dr. Y being on the lateral aspect of the area and Dr. X on the medial to get an adequate length of this.  The tissue was markedly inflamed and had significant adhesions noted.  The patient's spermatic vessels were also in the region as well as the renal vessels markedly scarred close to the ureteropelvic junction.  Ultimately, Dr. Y and Dr. X both with alternating dissection were able to dissect the renal pelvis to a position where Dr. Y put stay sutures and a 4-0 chromic to isolate the four quadrant area where we replaced the ureter.  Dr. X then divided the ureter and suture ligated the base, which was obstructed with a 3-0 chromic suture.  Dr. Y then spatulated the ureter for about 1.5 cm, and the stent was gently delivered in a normal location out of the ureter at the proximal and left alone in the bladder.  Dr. Y then incised the renal pelvis and dissected and opened it enough to allow the new ureteropelvic junction repair to be performed.  Dr. Y then placed interrupted sutures of 5-0 Monocryl at the apex to repair the most dependent portion of the renal pelvis, entered the lateral aspect, interrupted sutures of the repair.  Dr. X then was able to without much difficulty do interrupted sutures on the medial aspect.  The stent was then placed into the bladder in the proper orientation and alternating sutures by Dr. Y and Dr. X closed the ureteropelvic junction without any evidence of leakage.  Once this was complete, we removed the extra stay stitches and watched the ureter lay back into the retroperitoneum in a normal position without any kinking in apparently good position.  This opening was at least 1.5 cm wide.  Dr. Y then placed 2 stay sutures of 2-0 chromic in the lower pole of the kidney and then incised wedge biopsy and excised the biopsy with a 15-blade knife and curved iris scissors for renal biopsy for determination of renal tissue health.  Electrocautery was used on the base.  There was no bleeding, however, and the tissue was quite soft.  Dermabond and Gelfoam were placed, and then Dr. Y closed the biopsy site over with thrombin-Gelfoam using the 2-0 chromic stay sutures.  Dr. X then closed the fascial layers with running suture of 3-0 Vicryl in 3 layers.  Dr. Y closed the Scarpa fascia and the skin with 4-0 Vicryl and 4-0 Rapide respectively.  A 4-0 nylon suture was then placed by Dr. Y around the previous nephrostomy tube, which was again left clamped.  Dermabond tissue adhesive was placed over the incision and then a dry sterile dressing was placed by Dr. Y over the nephrostomy tube site, which was left clamped, and the patient then had a Foley catheter placed in the bladder.  The Foley catheter was then taped to his leg.  A second caudal block was placed for anesthesia, and he is in stable condition upon transfer to recovery room.\",\n",
       " 'REASON FOR CONSULTATION: , Mesothelioma.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , The patient is a 73-year-old pleasant Caucasian male who is known to me from his previous hospitalization.  He has also been seen by me in the clinic in the last few weeks.  He was admitted on January 18, 2008, with recurrent malignant pleural effusion.  On the same day, he underwent VATS and thoracoscopic drainage of the pleural effusion with right pleural nodule biopsy, lysis of adhesions, and directed talc insufflation by Dr. X.  He was found to have 2.5L of bloody pleural effusions, some loculated pleural effusion, adhesions, and carcinomatosis in the parenchyma.  His hospital course here has been significant for dyspnea, requiring ICU stay.  He also had a chest tube, which was taken out few days ago.  He has also had paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, for which he has been on amiodarone by cardiologist.  The biopsy from the pleural nodule done on the right on January 18, 2008, shows malignant epithelioid neoplasm consistent with mesothelioma.  Immunohistochemical staining showed tumor cells positive for calretinin and focally positive for D2-40, MOC-31.  Tumor cells are negative for CDX-2, and monoclonal CEA.,The patient at this time reports that overall he has been feeling better with decrease in shortness of breath and cough over the last few days.  He does have edema in his lower extremities.  He is currently on 4L of oxygen.  He denies any nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, recent change in bowel habit, melena, or hematochezia.  No neurological or musculoskeletal signs or symptoms.  He reports that he is able to ambulate to the bathroom, but gets short of breath on exertion.  He denies any other complaints.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:,  Left ventricular systolic dysfunction as per the previous echocardiogram done in December 2007, history of pneumonia in December 2007, admitted to XYZ Hospital.

Chest x-ray from yesterday shows right-sided Port-A-Cath, diffuse right lung parenchymal and pleural infiltration without change, mild pulmonary vascular congestion.,ASSESSMENT,1.  Mesothelioma versus primary lung carcinoma, two separate reports as for the two separate biopsies done several weeks apart.,2.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.,3.  Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.,4.  Malignant pleural effusion, status post surgery as stated above.,5.  Anemia of chronic disease.,RECOMMENDATIONS,1.  Compare the slides from the previous biopsy done in December at XYZ Hospital with recurrent pleural nodule biopsy slides.  I have discussed regarding this with Dr. Y in Pathology here at Methodist XYZ Hospital.  I will try to obtain the slides for comparison from XYZ Hospital for comparison and immunohistochemical staining.,2.  I will also discuss with Dr. X and also with intervention radiologist at XYZ Hospital regarding the exact sites of the two biopsies.,3.  Once the results of the above are available, I will make further recommendations regarding treatment.  The patient has significantly decreased performance status with dyspnea on exertion and is being planned for transfer to Triumph Hospital for rehab, which I agree with.,4.  Continue present care.,Discussed regarding the above in great details with the patient and his wife and daughter and answered the questions to their satisfaction.  They clearly understand the above.  They also understand his very poor performance status at this time, and the risks and benefits of delaying chemotherapy due to this.',\n",
       " 'OPERATION PERFORMED:,  Ligament reconstruction and tendon interposition arthroplasty of right wrist.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: , With the patient under adequate anesthesia, the right upper extremity was prepped and draped in a sterile manner.,Attention was turned to the base of the thumb where a longitudinal incision was made over the anatomic snuffbox and extended out onto the carpometacarpal joint.  Using blunt dissection radial sensory nerve was dissected and retracted out of the operative field.  Further blunt dissection exposed the radial artery, which was dissected and retracted off the trapezium.  An incision was then made across the scaphotrapezial joint distally onto the trapezium and out onto the carpometacarpal joint.  Sharp dissection exposed the trapezium, which was then morselized and removed in toto with care taken to protect the underlying flexor carpi radialis tendon.  The radial beak of the trapezoid was then osteotomized off the head of the scaphoid.  The proximal metacarpal was then fenestrated with a 4.5-mm drill bit.  Four fingers proximal to the flexion crease of the wrist a small incision was made over the FCR tendon and blunt dissection delivered the FCR tendon into this incision.  The FCR tendon was divided and this incision was closed with 4-0 nylon sutures.  Attention was returned to the trapezial wound where longitudinal traction on the FCR tendon delivered the FCR tendon into the wound.,The FCR tendon was then threaded through the fenestration in the metacarpal.  A bone anchor was then placed distal to the metacarpal fenestration.  The FCR tendon was then pulled distally and the metacarpal reduced to an anatomic position.  The FCR tendon was then sutured to the metacarpal using the previously placed bone anchor.  Remaining FCR tendon was then anchovied and placed into the scaphotrapezoidal and trapezial defect.  The MP joint was brought into extension and the capsule closed using interrupted 3-0 Tycron sutures.,Attention was turned to the MCP joint where the MP joint was brought in to 15 degrees of flexion and pinned with a single 0.035 Kirschner wire.  The pin was cut at the level of the skin.,All incisions were closed with running 3-0 Prolene subcuticular stitch.,Sterile dressings were then applied.  The tourniquet was deflated.  The patient was awakened from anesthesia and returned to the recovery room in satisfactory condition having tolerated the procedure well.',\n",

Arthroscopy with arthroscopic glenoid labrum debridement.,2.  Subacromial decompression.,3.  Rotator cuff repair, right shoulder.,SPECIFICATIONS:,  Intraoperative procedure was done at Inpatient Operative Suite, room #1 at ABCD Hospital.  This was done under interscalene and subsequent general anesthetic in the modified beach chair position.,HISTORY AND GROSS FINDINGS: , The patient is a 48-year-old with male who has been suffering increasing right shoulder pain for a number of months prior to surgical intervention.  He was completely refractory to conservative outpatient therapy.  After discussing the alternative care as well as the advantages, disadvantages, risks, complications, and expectations, he elected to undergo the above stated procedure on this date.,Intraarticularly, the joint was observed.  There was noted to be a degenerative glenoid labrum tear.  The biceps complex was otherwise intact.  There were minimal degenerative changes at the glenohumeral joint.  Rotator cuff tear was appreciated on the inner surface.  Subacromially, the same was true.  This was an elliptical to V-type tear.  The patient has a grossly positive type III acromion.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE: , The patient was laid supine on the operating table after receiving interscalene and then general anesthetic by the Anesthesia Department.  He was safely placed in modified beach chair position.  He was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.  Portals were created outside to end, posterior to anterior, and ultimately laterally in the typical fashion.  Upon complete diagnostic arthroscopy was carried out in the intraarticular aspect of the joint, a 4.2 meniscus shaver was placed anteriorly with the scope posteriorly.  Debridement was carried out to the glenoid labrum.  The biceps was probed and noted to be intact.  Undersurface of the rotator cuff was debrided with the shaver along with debridement of the subchondral region of the greater tuberosity attachment.,After this, instrumentation was removed.  The scope was placed subacromially and a lateral portal created.  Gross bursectomy was carried out in a stepwise fashion to the top part of the cuff as well as in the gutters.  An anterolateral portal was created.  Sutures were placed via express silk as well as other sutures with a #2 fiber wire.  With passing of the suture, they were tied with a slip-tight knot and then two half stitches.  There was excellent reduction of the tear.  Superolateral portal was then created.  A #1 Mitek suture anchor was then placed in the posterior cuff to bring this over to bleeding bone.  _______ suture was placed.  The implant was put into place.  The loop was grabbed and it was impacted in the previously drilled holes.  There was excellent reduction of the tear.,Trial range of motion was carried out and seemed to be satisfactory.,Prior to this, a subacromial decompression was accomplished after release of CA ligament with the vapor Bovie.  A 4.8 motorized barrel burr was utilized to sequentially take this down from the type III acromion to a flat type I acromion.,After all was done, copious irrigation was carried out throughout the joint.  Gross bursectomy lightly was carried out to remove all bony elements.  A pain buster catheter was placed through a separate portal and cut to length.  0.5% Marcaine was instilled after portals were closed with #4-0 nylon.  Adaptic, 4 x 4s, ABDs, and Elastoplast tape placed for dressing.  The patient was ultimately transferred to his cart and PACU in apparent satisfactory condition.  Expected surgical prognosis of this patient is fair.',\n",
       " 'CLINICAL HISTORY:,  A 48-year-old smoker found to have a right upper lobe mass on chest x-ray and is being evaluated for chest pain.  PET scan demonstrated a mass in the right upper lobe and also a mass in the right lower lobe, which were also identified by CT scan.  The lower lobe mass was approximately 1 cm in diameter and the upper lobe mass was 4 cm to 5 cm in diameter.  The patient was referred for surgical treatment.,SPECIMEN:,A.  Lung, wedge biopsy right lower lobe,B.  Lung, resection right upper lobe,C.  Lymph node, biopsy level 2 and 4,D.  Lymph node, biopsy level 7 subcarinal,FINAL DIAGNOSIS:,A.  Wedge biopsy of right lower lobe showing:  Adenocarcinoma, Grade 2, Measuring 1 cm in diameter with invasion of the overlying pleura and with free resection margin.,B.  Right upper lobe lung resection showing:  Adenocarcinoma, grade 2, measuring 4 cm in diameter with invasion of the overlying pleura and with free bronchial margin.  Two (2) hilar lymph nodes with no metastatic tumor.,C.  Lymph node biopsy at level 2 and 4 showing seven (7) lymph nodes with anthracosis and no metastatic tumor.,D.  Lymph node biopsy, level 7 subcarinal showing (5) lymph nodes with anthracosis and no metastatic tumor.,COMMENT:  ,The morphology of the tumor seen in both lobes is similar and we feel that the smaller tumor involving the right lower lobe is most likely secondary to transbronchial spread from the main tumor involving the right upper lobe.  This suggestion is supported by the fact that no obvious vascular or lymphatic invasion is demonstrated and adjacent to the smaller tumor, there is isolated nests of tumor cells within the air spaces.  Furthermore, immunoperoxidase stain for Ck-7, CK-20 and TTF are performed on both the right lower and right upper lobe nodule.  The immunohistochemical results confirm the lung origin of both tumors and we feel that the tumor involving the right lower lobe is due to transbronchial spread from the larger tumor nodule involving the right upper lobe.,',\n",

He was brought to the operating room now for Port-A-Cath placement for chemotherapy.  After informed consent was obtained with the patient, the patient was taken to the operating room, placed in supine position.  After induction of general endotracheal anesthesia, routine prep and drape of the left chest, left subclavian vein was cannulated with #18 gauze needle, and guidewire was inserted.  Needle was removed.  Small incision was made large enough to harbor the port.  Dilator and introducers were then placed over the guidewire.  Guidewire and dilator were removed, and a Port-A-Cath was introduced in the subclavian vein through the introducers.  Introducers were peeled away without difficulty.  He measured with fluoroscopy and cut to the appropriate length.  The tip of the catheter was noted to be at the junction of the superior vena cava and right atrium.  It was then connected to the hub of the port.  Port was then aspirated for patency and flushed with heparinized saline and summoned to the chest wall.  Wounds were then closed.  Needle count, sponge count, and instrument counts were all correct.',\n",

He has been having significant feet pain with significant planovalgus deformity.  The patient was noted to have flexible vertical talus.  It was decided that the patient would benefit by subtalar arthrodesis, possible autograft, and Achilles lengthening.  This was explained to the mother in detail.  This is going to be a stabilizing measure and the patient will probably need additional surgery at a later day when his foot is more mature.  Risks of surgery include risks of anesthesia, infection, bleeding, changes in sensation and motion of the extremity, hardware failure, need for other surgical procedures, need to be nonweightbearing for some time.  All questions were answered and the mother agreed to the above plan.,PROCEDURE NOTE: , The patient was taken to the operating room, placed supine on the operating room, general anesthesia was administered.  The patient received Ancef preoperatively.  Bilateral nonsterile tourniquets were placed on each thigh.  A bump was placed underneath the left buttock.  Both the extremities were then prepped and draped in standard surgical fashion.  Attention was first turned towards the left side.  Intended incision was marked on the skin.  The ankle was taken through a range of motion with noted improvement in the reduction of the talocalcaneal alignment with the foot in plantar flexion on the lateral view.  The foot was wrapped in Esmarch prior to inflation of tourniquet to 200 mmHg.  Incision was then made over the left lateral aspect of the hind foot to expose the talocalcaneal joint.  The sinus tarsi was then identified using a U-shaped flap to tack muscles, and periosteum was retracted distally.  Once the foot was reduced a Steinman pin was used to hold it in position.  This position was first checked on the fluoroscopy.  The 7/8th inch staple was then placed across the sinus tarsi to maintain the reduction.  This was also checked with fluoroscopy.  The incision was then extended posteriorly to allow for visualization of the Achilles, which was Z-lengthened with the release of the lateral distal half.  This was sutured using 2-0 Ethibond and that was also oversewn.  The wound was irrigated with normal saline.  The periosteal flap was sutured over the staple using 2-0 Vicryl.  Skin was closed using 2-0 Vicryl interrupted and then with 4-0 Monocryl.  The area was injected with 6 mL of 0.25% Marcaine local anesthetic.  The wound was cleaned and dried, dressed with Steri-Strips, Xeroform, and 4 x 4s and Webril.  Tourniquet was released after 53 minutes.  The exact same procedure was repeated on the right side with no changes or complications.  Tourniquet time on the right side was 45 minutes.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  Bilateral long-leg casts were then placed with the foot in neutral with some moulding of his medial plantar arch.  The patient was subsequently was taken to Recovery in stable condition.,POSTOPERATIVE PLAN: , The patient will be hospitalized overnight for pain as per parents' request.  The patient is to be strict nonweightbearing for at least 6 weeks.  He is to follow up in the next 10 days for a check.  We will plan of changing to short-leg casts in about 4 weeks postop.\",\n",

A decision was made to take her for a C-section early.,FINDINGS: , The patient had an enlarged fibroid uterus with a large anterior fibroid with large varicosities, normal appearing tubes and ovaries bilaterally.  There was a live male infant in the ROA position with Apgars of 9 at 1 minute and 9 at 5 minutes and a weight of 5 lb 4 oz.,PROCEDURE: , Prior to the procedure, an informed consent was obtained.  The patient who previously been interested in a tubal ligation refused the tubal ligation prior to surgery.  She states that she and her husband are fully disgusted and that they changed their mind and they were adamant about this.  After informed consent was obtained, the patient was taken to the operating room where spinal anesthetic with Astramorph was administered.  She was then prepped and draped in the normal sterile fashion.  Once the anesthetic was tested, it was found to be inadequate and a general anesthetic was administered.  Once the general anesthetic was administered and the patient was asleep, the previous incision was removed with the skin knife and this incision was then carried through an underlying layer of fascia with a second knife.  The fascia was incised in the midline with a second knife.  This incision was then extended laterally in both directions with the Mayo scissors.  The superior aspect of this fascial incision was then dissected off to the underlying rectus muscle bluntly without using Ochsner clamps.  It was then dissected in the midline with Mayo scissors.  The inferior aspect of this incision was then addressed in a similar manner.  The rectus muscles were then separated in the midline with a hemostat.  The rectus muscles were separated further in the midline with Mayo scissors superiorly and inferiorly.  Next, the peritoneum was grasped with two hemostats, tented up and entered sharply with the Metzenbaum scissors.  This incision was extended inferiorly with the Metzenbaum scissors, being careful to avoid the bladder and the peritoneal incision was extended bluntly.  Next, the bladder blade was placed.  The vesicouterine peritoneum was identified, tenting up with Allis clamps and entered sharply with the Metzenbaum scissors.  This incision was extended laterally in both directions and a bladder flap was created digitally.  The bladder blade was then reinserted.  Next, the uterine incision was made with a second knife and the uterus was entered with the blunt end of the knife.  Next, the uterine incision was extended laterally in both directions with the banded scissors.  Next, the infant's head and body were delivered without difficulty.  There was multiple section on the abdomen.  The cord was clamped and cut.  Section of cord was collected for gases and the cord blood was collected.  Next, the placenta was manually extracted.  The uterus was exteriorized and cleared of all clots and debris.  The edges of the uterine incision were then identified with Allis _______ clamps.  The uterine incision was reapproximated with #0 chromic in a running locked fashion and a second layer of the same suture was used to obtain excellent hemostasis.  One figure-of-eight with #0 chromic was used in one area to prevent a questionable hematoma from expanding along the varicosity for the anterior fibroid.  After several minutes of observation, the hematoma was seem to be non-expanding.  The uterus was replaced in the abdomen.  The uterine incision was reexamined and seem to be continuing to be hemostatic.  The pelvic gutters were then cleared of all clots and debris.  The vesicouterine peritoneum was then reapproximated with #3-0 Vicryl in a running fashion.  The peritoneum was then closed with #0 Vicryl in a running fashion.  The rectus muscles reapproximated with #0 Vicryl in a single interrupted stitch.  The fascia was closed with #0 Vicryl in a running locked fashion and the skin was closed with staples.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  Sponge, lap, and needle counts were correct x3.  The patient was then taken to Recovery in stable condition and she will be followed for immediate postoperative course in the hospital.\",\n",
       " 'PROCEDURE PERFORMED: , Modified radical mastectomy.,ANESTHESIA: , General endotracheal tube.,PROCEDURE:  ,After informed consent was obtained, the patient was brought to the operative suite and placed supine on the operating room table.  General endotracheal anesthesia was induced without incident.  The patient was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.  Care was taken to ensure that the arm was placed in a relaxed manner away from the body to facilitate exposure and to avoid nerve injury.,An elliptical incision was made to incorporate the nipple-areolar complex and the previous biopsy site.  The skin incision was carried down to the subcutaneous fat but no further.  Using traction and counter-traction, the upper flap was dissected from the chest wall medially to the sternal border, superiorly to the clavicle, laterally to the anterior border of the latissimus dorsi muscle, and superolaterally to the insertion of the pectoralis major muscle.  The lower flap was dissected in a similar manner down to the insertion of the pectoralis fascia overlying the fifth rib medially and laterally out to the latissimus dorsi.  Bovie electrocautery was used for the majority of the dissection and hemostasis tying only the large vessels with 2-0 Vicryl.  The breast was dissected from the pectoralis muscle beginning medially and progressing laterally removing the pectoralis fascia entirely.  Once the lateral border of the pectoralis major muscle was identified, the pectoralis muscle was retracted medially and the interpectoral fat was removed with the specimen.,The axillary dissection was then begun by incising the fascia overlying axilla proper allowing visualization of the axillary vein.  The highest point of axillary dissection was then marked with a long stitch for identification by the surgical pathologist.  The axilla was then cleared of its contents by sharp dissection.  Small vessels entering the axillary vein were clipped and divided.  The axilla was cleared down to the chest wall, and dissection was continued laterally to the subscapular vein.  The long thoracic nerve was cleared identified lying against the chest and was carefully preserved.  The long thoracic nerve represented the posterior most aspect of the dissection.  As the axillary contents were dissected in the posterolateral axilla, the thoracodorsal nerve was identified and carefully preserved.  The dissection continued caudally until the entire specimen was freed and delivered from the operative field.  Copious water lavage was used to remove any debris, and hemostasis was obtained with Bovie electrocautery.,Two Jackson-Pratt drains were inserted through separate stab incisions below the initial incision and cut to fit.  The most posterior of the 2 was directed into the axilla and the other directed anteriorly across the pectoralis major.  These were secured to the skin using 2-0 silk, which was Roman-sandaled around the drain.,The skin incision was approximated with skin staples.  A dressing was applied.  The drains were placed on \"grenade\" suction.  All surgical counts were reported as correct.,Having tolerated the procedure well, the patient was subsequently extubated and taken to the recovery room in good and stable condition.',\n",
       " \"HISTORY:,  The patient is a 10-1/2-year-old born with asplenia syndrome with a complex cyanotic congenital heart disease characterized by dextrocardia bilateral superior vena cava, complete atrioventricular septal defect, a total anomalous pulmonary venous return to the right-sided atrium, and double-outlet to the right ventricle with malposed great vessels, the aorta being anterior with a severe pulmonary stenosis.  He had undergone staged repair beginning on 04/21/1997 with a right modified Blalock-Taussig shunt followed on 09/02/1999 with a bilateral bidirectional Glenn shunt, and left pulmonary artery to main pulmonary artery pericardial patch augmentation.  These procedures were performed at Medical College Hospital.  Family states that they moved to the United States.  Evaluation at the Children's Hospital earlier this year demonstrated complete occlusion of the right bidirectional Glenn shunt as well as occlusion of the proximal right pulmonary artery.  He was also found to have elevated Glenn pressures at 22 mmHg, transpulmonary gradient axis of 14 mmHg.  The QP:QS ratio of 0.6:1.  A large decompressing venous collateral was also appreciated.  The patient was brought back to cardiac catheterization in an attempt to reconstitute the right caval pulmonary anastomosis and to occlude the venous collateral vessel.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: , After sedation and local Xylocaine anesthesia, the patient was prepped and draped.  Cardiac catheterization was performed as outlined in the attached continuation sheets.  Vascular entry was by percutaneous technique, and the patient was heparinized.  Monitoring during the procedure included continuous surface ECG, continuous pulse oximetry, and cycled cuff blood pressures, in addition to intravascular pressures.,Using a 6-French sheath, a 6-French wedge catheter was inserted in the right femoral vein and advanced from the inferior vena cava into the right-sided atrium pulmonary veins and the right ventricle.,Using a 6-French sheath, a 5-French pigtail catheter was inserted into the right femoral artery and advanced retrograde to the descending aorta and ascending aorta.  A separate port of arterial access was obtained in the left femoral artery utilizing a 5-French sheath.,Percutaneous access into the right jugular vein was attempted, but unsuccessful.  Ultrasound on the right neck demonstrated a complete thrombosis of the right internal jugular vein.  Using percutaneous technique and a 5-French sheath, 5-French wedge catheter was inserted into the left internal jugular vein and advanced along the left superior vena cava across the left caval-pulmonary anastomosis into the main pulmonary artery and left pulmonary artery with aid of guidewire.  This catheter then also advanced into the bridging innominate vein.  The catheter was then exchanged over wire for a 4-French Bernstein catheter, which was advanced to the blind end of the right superior vena cava.  A balloon wedge angiogram of the right lower pulmonary vein demonstrated back filling of a small right lower pulmonary artery.  There was no vascular continuity to the stump of the right Glenn.  The jugular venous catheter and sheaths were exchanged over a wire for a 6-French flexor sheath, which was advanced to the proximal right superior vena cava.  The Bernstein catheter was then reintroduced using a Terumo guidewire.  Probing of the superior vena cava facilitated access into the right lower pulmonary artery.  The angiogram in the right pulmonary artery showed a diminutive right lower pulmonary artery and severe long segment proximal stenosis.  The distal pulmonary measured approximately 5.5 to 60 mm in diameter with a long segment stenosis measuring approximately 31 mm in length.  The length of the obstruction was balloon dilated using ultra-thin SD 4 x 2 cm balloon catheter with complete disappearance of the waist.  This facilitated advancement of a flexor sheath into the proximal portion of the stenosis.  A PG 2960 BPX Genesis stent premounted on a 6 mm OptiProbe.  A balloon catheter was advanced across the area of narrowing and inflated with a near-complete disappearance of proximal waist.  Angiogram demonstrated a good stent apposition to the caval wall.  Further angioplasty was then performed utilizing an ultra-thin SDS 8 x 3 cm balloon catheter inflated to 19 atmospheres pressure with complete disappearance of a distinct proximal waist.  Angiogram demonstrated wide patency of reconstituted right caval pulmonary anastomosis though there was no flow seen to the right upper pulmonary artery.  The balloon wedge angiograms were then obtained in the right upper pulmonary veins suggesting the presence of right upper pulmonary artery and not contiguous with the right lower pulmonary artery.  Bernstein catheter was advanced into the main pulmonary artery where a wire probing of the stump of the proximal right pulmonary artery facilitated access to the right upper pulmonary artery.  Angiogram demonstrated severe long segment stenosis of the proximal right pulmonary artery.  Angioplasty of the right pulmonary was then performed using the OptiProbe 6-mm balloon catheter inflated to 16 atmospheres pressure with disappearance of a distinct waist.  Repeat angiogram showed improvement in caliber of right upper pulmonary artery with filling defect of the proximal right pulmonary artery.  The proximal right pulmonary artery was then dilated and stent implanted using a PG 2980 BPX Genesis stent premounted on 8-mm OptiProbe balloon catheter and implanted with complete disappearance of the waist.  Distal right upper pulmonary artery was then dilated and stent implanted utilizing a PG 1870 BPX Genesis stent premounted on 7-mm OptiProbe balloon catheter.  Repeat angiograms were then performed.  Attention was then directed to the large venous collateral vessel arising from the left superior vena cava with a contrast filling of a left-sided azygos vein.  A selective angiogram demonstrated a large azygos vein of the midsection measuring approximately 9.4 mm in diameter.  An Amplatzer 12 mm vascular plug was loaded on the delivery catheter and advanced through the flexor sheath into the azygos vein.  Once stable device was confirmed, the device was released from the delivery catheter.  The 4-French Bernstein catheter was then reintroduced and 5 inch empirical 0.038 inch, 10 cm x 8 mm detachable coils were then implanted above the vascular plug filling the proximal azygos vein.  A pigtail catheter was then introduced into the left superior vena cava for final angiogram.,Flows were calculated by the Fick technique using an assumed oxygen consumption and contents derived from Radiometer Hemoximeter saturations and hemoglobin capacity.,Cineangiograms were obtained with injection of the coronary sinus of pulmonary veins, the innominate vein, superior vena cava, the main pulmonary artery, and azygos vein.,After angiography, two normal-appearing renal collecting systems were visualized.  The catheters and sheaths were removed and topical pressure applied for hemostasis.  The patient was returned to the recovery room in satisfactory condition.  There were no complications.,DISCUSSION:,  Oxygen consumption was assumed to be normal mixed venous saturation, but was low due to systemic arterial desaturation of 79%.  The pulmonary veins were fully saturated with partial pressure of oxygen ranging between 120 and 169 mmHg in 30% oxygen.  Remaining saturations reflected complete admixture.  There was increased saturation in the left pulmonary artery due to aortopulmonary collateral flow.  Phasic right atrial pressures were normal with an A-wave somewhat to the normal right ventricular end-diastolic pressure of 9 mmHg.  Left ventricular systolic pressure was systemic with no outflow obstruction to the ascending aorta.  Phasic ascending, descending pressures were similar and normal.  Mean Glenn pressures at initiation of the case were slightly elevated at 14 mmHg with a transpulmonary gradient of 9 mmHg.  The calculated systemic flow was a normal pulmonary flows reduced with a QP:QS ratio of 0.6:1.  The pulmonary vascular resistance was elevated at 4.4 Woods units.  Following stent implantation in the right caval pulmonary anastomosis and right pulmonary artery, there was a slight increase in the Glenn venous pressures to 16 mmHg.  Following embolization of the azygos vein, there was increase in systemic arterial saturation to 84% and increase in mixed venous saturation.  There was similar increase in Glenn pressures to 28 mmHg with a transpulmonary gradient of 14 mmHg.  There was an increase in arterial pressure.  The calculated systemic flow increased from 3.1 liters /minute/meter squared to 4.3 liters/minute/meter squared.  Angiogram within the innominate vein following stent implantation demonstrated appropriate stent position without significant distortion of the innominate vein or proximal cava.  There appeared unobstructed contrast flow to the right lower pulmonary artery of a 1-mmHg mean pressure gradient.  There was absence of contrast filling of the right middle and right upper pulmonary artery.  Final angiogram with a contrast injection in the left superior vena cava showed a forward flow through the right Glenn, a good contrast filling of the right lower pulmonary artery, and a widely patent left Glenn negative contrast washout of the proximal right pulmonary artery and left pulmonary artery presumably due to aortopulmonary collateral flow.  Contrast injection within the right upper pulmonary artery following the stent implantation demonstrated widely patent proximal right pulmonary artery along the length of the implanted stents though with retrograde contrast flow.,INITIAL DIAGNOSES:  ,1.

       " \"REASON FOR CONSULT: , I was asked to see this patient with metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer, on hospice with inferior ST-elevation MI.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , The patient from prior strokes has expressive aphasia, is not able to express herself in a clear meaningful fashion.  Her daughter who accompanies her is very attentive whom I had met previously during drainage of a malignant hemorrhagic pericardial effusion last month.  The patient has been feeling well for the last several weeks, per the daughter, but today per the personal aide, became agitated and uncomfortable at about 2:30 p.m.  At about 7 p.m., the patient began vomiting, was noted to be short of breath by her daughter with garbled speech, arms flopping, and irregular head movements.  Her daughter called 911 and her symptoms seemed to improve.  Then, she began vomiting.  When the patient's daughter asked her if she had chest pain, the patient said yes.,She came to the emergency room, an EKG showed inferior ST-elevation MI.  I was called immediately and knowing her history, especially, her hospice status with recent hemorrhagic pericardial effusion, I felt thrombolytic was contraindicated and she would not be a candidate for aggressive interventional therapy with PCI/CABG.  She was begun after discussion with the oncologist, on heparin drip and has received morphine, nitro, and beta-blocker, and currently states that she is pain free.  Repeat EKG shows normalization of her ST elevation in the inferior leads as well as normalization of prior reciprocal changes.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: , Significant for metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer.  In early-to-mid December, she had an admission and was found to have a malignant pericardial effusion with tamponade requiring urgent drainage.  We did repeat an echo several weeks later and that did not show any recurrence of the pericardial effusion.  She is on hospice from the medical history, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, history of multiple CVA.,MEDICATIONS: , Medications as an outpatient:,1.  Amiodarone 200 mg once a day.,2.  Roxanol concentrate 5 mg three hours p.r.n. pain.,ALLERGIES:  ,CODEINE.  NO SHRIMP, SEAFOOD, OR DYE ALLERGY.,FAMILY HISTORY: , Negative for cardiac disease.,SOCIAL HISTORY: , She does not smoke cigarettes.  She uses alcohol.  No use of illicit drugs.  She is divorced and lives with her daughter.  She is a retired medical librarian from Florida.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  ,Unable to be obtained due to the patient's aphasia.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: , Height 5 feet 3, weight of 106 pounds, temperature 97.1 degrees, blood pressure ranges from 138/82 to 111/87, pulse 61, respiratory rate 22.  O2 saturation 100%.  On general exam, she is an elderly woman with now marked aphasia, which per her daughter waxes and wanes, was more pronounced and she nods her head up and down when she says the word, no, and conversely, she nods her head side-to-side when she uses the word yes with some discordance in her head gestures with vocalization.  HEENT shows the cranium is normocephalic and atraumatic.  She has dry mucosal membrane.  She now has a right facial droop, which per her daughter is new.  Neck veins are not distended.  No carotid bruits visible.  Skin:  Warm, well perfused.  Lungs are clear to auscultation anteriorly.  No wheezes.  Cardiac exam:  S1, S2, regular rate.  No significant murmurs.  PMI is nondisplaced.  Abdomen:  Soft, nondistended.  Extremities:  Without edema, on limited exam.  Neurological exam seems to show only the right facial droop.,DIAGNOSTIC/LABORATORY DATA: , EKGs as reviewed above.  Her last ECG shows normalization of prior ST elevation in the inferior leads with Q waves and first-degree AV block, PR interval 280 milliseconds.  Further lab shows sodium 135, potassium 4.2, chloride 98, bicarbonate 26, BUN 9, creatinine 0.8, glucose 162, troponin 0.17, INR 1.27, white blood cell count 1.3, hematocrit 31, platelet count of 179.,Chest x-ray, no significant pericardial effusion.,IMPRESSION: , The patient is a 69-year-old woman with metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer with a recent hemorrhagic pericardial effusion, now admitted with cerebrovascular accident and transient inferior myocardial infarction, which appears to be canalized.  I will discuss this in detail with the patient and her daughter, and clearly, her situation is quite guarded with likely poor prognosis, which they are understanding of.,RECOMMENDATIONS:,1.  I think it is reasonable to continue heparin, but clearly she would be at risk for hemorrhagic pericardial effusion recurrence.,2.  Morphine is appropriate, especially for preload reduction and other comfort measures as appropriate.,3.  Would avoid other blood thinners including Plavix, Integrilin, and certainly, she is not a candidate for a thrombolytic with which the patient and her daughter are in agreement with after a long discussion.,Other management as per the medical service.  I have discussed the case with Dr. X of the hospitalist service who will be admitting the patient.\",\n",

Due to him being healthy with no comorbid conditions, he has elected to undergo surgical treatment with radical retropubic prostatectomy.  Potential complications include, but are not limited to:,1.  Infection.,2.  Bleeding.,3.  Incontinence.,4.  Impotence.,5.  Injury to the adjacent viscera.,6.  Deep venous thrombosis.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , Prophylactic antibiotic was given in the preoperative holding area, after which the patient was transferred to the operating room.  Epidural anesthesia and general endotracheal anesthesia were administered by Dr. A without any difficulty.  The patient was shaved, prepped, and draped using the usual sterile technique.  A sterile 16-French Foley catheter was then placed with clear urine drained.  A midline infraumbilical incision was performed by using a #10 scalpel blade.  The rectus fascia and the subcutaneous space were opened by using the Bovie.  Transversalis fascia was opened in the midline and the retropubic space and the paravesical space were developed bluntly.  A Bookwalter retractor was then placed.  The area of the obturator lymph nodes were carefully inspected and no suspicious adenopathy was detected.  Given this patient's low Gleason score and low PSA with a solitary core biopsy positive, the decision was made to not perform bilateral lymphadenectomy.  The endopelvic fascia was opened bilaterally by using the Metzenbaum scissors.  Opening was enlarged by using sharp dissection.  Small perforating veins from the prostate into the lateral pelvic wall were controlled by using bipolar coagulation device.  The dorsal aspect of the prostate was bunched up by using 2-0 silk sutures.  The deep dorsal vein complex was bunched up by using Allis also and ligated by using 0 Vicryl suture in a figure-of-eight fashion.  With the prostate retracted cephalad, the deep dorsal vein complex was transected superficially using the Bovie.  Deeper near the urethra, the dorsal vein complex was transected by using Metzenbaum scissors.  The urethra could then be easily identified.  Nearly two-third of the urethra from anteriorly to posteriorly was opened by using Metzenbaum scissors.  This exposed the blue Foley catheter.  Anastomotic sutures were then placed on to the urethral stump using 2-0 Monocryl suture.  Six of these were placed evenly spaced out anteriorly to posteriorly.  The Foley catheter was then removed.  This allowed for better traction of the prostate laterally.  Lateral pelvic fascia was opened bilaterally.  This effectively released the neurovascular bundle from the apex to the base of the prostate.  Continued dissection from the lateral pelvic fascia deeply opened up the plane into the perirectal fat.  The prostate was then dissected from laterally to medially from this opening in the perirectal fat.  The floor of the urethra posteriorly and the rectourethralis muscle was then transected just distal to the prostate.  Maximal length of ureteral stump was preserved.  The prostate was carefully lifted cephalad by using gentle traction with fine forceps.  The prostate was easily dissected off the perirectal fat using sharp dissection only.  Absolutely, no traction to the neurovascular bundle was evident at any point in time.  The dissection was carried out easily until the seminal vesicles could be visualized.  The prostate pedicles were controlled easily by using multiple medium clips in 4 to 5 separate small bundles on each side.  The bladder neck was then dissected out by using a bladder neck dissection method.  Unfortunately, most of the bladder neck fiber could not be preserved due to the patient's anatomy.  Once the prostate had been separated from the bladder in the area with the bladder neck, dissection was carried out posteriorly to develop a plane between the bladder and the seminal vesicles.  This was developed without any difficulty.  Both vas deferens were identified, hemoclipped and transected.  The seminal vesicles on both sides were quite large and a decision was made to not completely dissect the tip off, as it extended quite deeply into the pelvis.  About two-thirds of the seminal vesicles were able to be removed.  The tip was left behind.  Using the bipolar Gyrus coagulation device, the seminal vesicles were clamped at the tip sealed by cautery and then transected.  This was performed on the left side and then the right side.  This completely freed the prostate.  The prostate was sent for permanent section.  The opening in the bladder neck was reduced by using two separate 2-0 Vicryl sutures.  The mucosa of the bladder neck was everted by using 4-0 chromic sutures.  Small amount of bleeding around the area of the posterior bladder wall was controlled by using suture ligature.  The ureteral orifice could be seen easily from the bladder neck opening and was completely away from the everting sutures.  The previously placed anastomotic suture on the urethral stump was then placed on the corresponding position on the bladder neck.  This was performed by using a French ***** needle.  A 20-French Foley catheter was then inserted and the sutures were sequentially tied down.  A 15 mL of sterile water was inflated to balloon.  The bladder anastomosis to the urethra was performed without any difficulty.  A 19-French Blake Drain was placed in the left pelvis exiting the right inguinal region.  All instrument counts, lap counts, and latex were verified twice prior to the closure.  The rectus fascia was closed in running fashion using #1 PDS.  Subcutaneous space was closed by using 2-0 Vicryl sutures.  The skin was reapproximated by using metallic clips.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to the recovery room in stable condition.\",\n",

The bronchoscope was then advanced through the larynx into the trachea.  The trachea showed mild evidence of erythema and moderate amounts of clear frothy secretions.  These were suctioned clear.  The bronchoscope was then advanced through the carina, which was sharp.  Then advanced into the left main stem and each segment, subsegement in the left upper lingula and lower lobe was visualized.  There was mild tracheobronchitis with mild friability throughout.  There was modest amounts of white secretion.  There were no other findings including evidence of mass, anatomic distortions, or hemorrhage.  The bronchoscope was subsequently withdrawn and advanced into the right mainstem.  Again, each segment and subsegment was well visualized.  The right upper lobe anatomy showed some segmental distortion with dilation and irregularities both at the apical region as well as in the subsegments of the anteroapical and posterior segments.  No specific masses or other lesions were identified throughout the tracheobronchial tree on the right.  There was mild tracheal bronchitis with friability.  Upon coughing, there was punctate hemorrhage.  The bronchoscope was then advanced through the bronchus intermedius and the right middle lobe and right lower lobe.  These again had no other anatomic lesions identified.  The bronchoscope was then wedged in the right middle lobe and bronchoalveolar samples were obtained.  The bronchoscope was withdrawn and the area was suctioned clear.  The bronchoscope was then advanced into the apical segment of the right upper lobe and the bronchioalveolar lavage again performed.  Samples were taken and the bronchoscope was removed suctioned the area clear.  The bronchoscope was then re-advanced into the right lower lobe and multiple transbronchial biopsies were taken under fluoroscopic guidance in the posterior and lateral segments of the right lower lobe.  Minimal hemorrhage was identified and suctioned clear without difficulty.  The bronchoscope was then withdrawn to the mainstem.  The area was suctioned clear.  Fluoroscopy revealed no evidence of pneumothorax.  The bronchoscope was then withdrawn.  The patient tolerated the procedure well without evidence of desaturation or complications.',\n",

This operative note will discuss the right total knee arthroplasty.,ANESTHESIA:  ,General.,COMPLICATIONS: , None.,BLOOD LOSS: , Approximately 150 cc.,HISTORY:,  This is a 79-year-old female who has disabling bilateral knee degenerative arthritis.  She has been unresponsive to conservative measures.  All risks, complications, anticipated benefits, and postoperative course were discussed.  The patient has agreed to proceed with surgery as described below.,GROSS FINDINGS: , There was noted to be eburnation and wear along the patellofemoral joint and femoral tibial articulation medially and laterally with osteophyte formation and sclerosis.,SPECIFICATIONS: , The Zimmer NexGen total knee system was utilized.,PROCEDURE: , The patient was taken to the operating room #2 and placed in supine position on the operating room table.  She was administered spinal anesthetic by Dr. Z.,The tourniquet was placed about the proximal aspect of the right lower extremity.  The right lower extremity was then sterilely prepped and draped in the usual fashion.  An Esmarch bandage was used to exsanguinate the right lower extremity and the tourniquet was inflated to 325 mmHg.  Longitudinal incision was made over the anterior aspect of the right knee.  Subcutaneous tissue was carefully dissected.  A medial parapatellar retinacular incision was made.  The patella was then everted and the above noted gross findings were appreciated.  A drill hole was placed in the distal aspect of the femur and the distal femoral cutting guides were positioned in place.  The appropriate cuts were made at the distal femur as well as with use of the chamfer guide.  The trial femoral component was then positioned in place and noted to have good fit.  Attention was then directed to proximal tibia, the external tibial alignment guide was positioned in place and the proximal tibial cut was made demonstrating satisfactory cut.  The medial and lateral collateral ligaments remained intact throughout the procedure as well as the posterior cruciate ligaments.  The remnants of the anterior cruciate ligament and menisci were resected.  The tibial trial was positioned in place.  Intraoperative radiographs were taken, demonstrating satisfactory alignment of the tibial cut.  The tibial holes were then drilled.  The patella was then addressed with the Bovie used to remove the soft tissue around the perimeter of the patella.  The patellar cutting guide was positioned in place and the posterior aspect of the patella was resected to the appropriate thickness.  Three drill holes were made within the patella after it was determined that 35 mm patella would be most appropriate.  The knee was placed through range of motion with the trial components marked and then the appropriate components obtained.  The tibial tray was inserted with cement, backed it into place, excess methylmethacrylate was removed.  The femoral component was inserted with methylmethacrylate.  Any excessive methylmethacrylate and bony debris were removed from the joint.  Trial Poly was positioned in place and the knee was held in full extension while the methylmethacrylate became firm.  The methylmethacrylate was also used at the patella.  The prosthesis was positioned in place.  The patellar clamp held securely till the methylmethacrylate was firm.  After all three components were in place, the knee was then again in placed range of motion and there appeared to be some torsion to the proximal tibial component and concerned regarding the alignment.  This component was removed and revised to a stemmed component with better alignment and position.  The previous component removed, the methylmethacrylate was removed.  Further irrigation was performed and then a stemmed template was positioned in place with the intramedullary alignment guide positioned and the tibia drilled and broached.  The trial tibial stemmed component was positioned in place.  Knee was placed through range of motion and the tracking was better.  Actual component was then obtained, methyl methacrylate was placed within the tibia.  The stemmed tibial component was impacted into place with good fit.  The Poly was then positioned in place.  Knee held in full extension with compression longitudinally after methylmethacrylate was solidified.  The trial Poly was removed.  Wound was irrigated and the joint was inspected.  There was no debris.  Collateral ligaments and posterior cruciate ligaments remained intact.  Soft tissue balancing was done and a 17 mm Poly was then inserted with the knee and tibial and femoral components with good tracking as well as the patellar component.  The tourniquet was deflated.  Hemostasis was satisfactory.  A drain was placed into the depths of the wound.  The medial retinacular incision was closed with one Ethibond suture in interrupted fashion.  The knee was placed through range of motion and there was no undue tissue tension, good patellar tracking, no excessive soft tissue laxity or constrain.  The subcutaneous tissue was closed with #2-0 undyed Vicryl in interrupted fashion.  The skin was closed with surgical clips.  The exterior of the wound was cleansed as well padded dressing ABDs and ace wrap over the right lower extremity.  At the completion of the procedure, distal pulses were intact.  Toes were pink, warm, with good capillary refill.  Distal neurovascular status was intact.  Postoperative x-ray demonstrated satisfactory alignment of the prosthesis.  Prognosis is good in this 79-year-old female with a significant degenerative arthritis.',\n",

He complained of pain on the medial aspect of his right knee after an injury at work, which he twisted his right knee.,PROCEDURE:  ,After all potential complications, risks, as well as anticipated benefits of the above-named procedures were discussed at length with the patient, informed consent was obtained.  The operative extremity was then confirmed with the operative surgeon, the patient, the Department of Anesthesia and the nursing staff.,The patient was then transferred to preoperative area to Operative Suite #2, placed on the operating table in supine position.  Department of Anesthesia administered general anesthetic to the patient.  All bony prominences were well padded at this time.  The right lower extremity was then properly positioned in a Johnson knee holder.  At this time, 1% lidocaine with epinephrine 20 cc was administered to the right knee intra-articularly under sterile conditions.  The right lower extremity was then sterilely prepped and draped in usual sterile fashion.  Next, after all bony soft tissue landmarks were identified, an inferolateral working portal was established by making a 1-cm transverse incision at the level of the joint line lateral to the patellar tendon.  The cannula and trocar were then inserted through this, putting the patellofemoral joint.  An arthroscopic camera was then inserted and the knee was sequentially examined including the patellofemoral joint, the medial and lateral gutters, medial lateral joints, and the femoral notch.  Upon viewing of the patellofemoral joint, there was noted to be grade-II chondromalacia changes of the patella.  There were no loose bodies noted in the either gutter.  Upon viewing of the medial compartment, there was no chondromalacia or meniscal tear was noted.  While in this area, attention was directed to establish the inferomedial instrument portal.  This was first done using a spinal needle for localization followed by 1-cm transverse incision at the joint line.  A probe was then inserted through this portal and the meniscus was further probed.  Again, there was noted to be no meniscal tear.  The knee was taken through range of motion and there was no chondromalacia.  Upon viewing of the femoral notch, there was noted to be intact ACL with negative drawer sign.  PCL was also noted to be intact.  Upon viewing of the lateral compartment, there was noted to be a large bucket-handle tear involving the lateral and posterior horns.  It was reduced from the place, however, involved the white and red white area was elected to excise the bucket-handle.  An arthroscopic scissor was then inserted and the two remaining attachments the posterior and lateral attachments were then clipped and a Schlesinger grasper was then used to remove the resected meniscus.  It was noted that the meniscus was followed out to the whole and the entire piece was taken out of the knee.  Pictures were taken both pre-meniscal resection and post-meniscal resection.  The arthroscopic shaver was then inserted into the medial portal and the remaining meniscus was contoured.  The lateral gutter was then examined and was noted to be no loose bodies and ______ was intact.  Next, attention was directed to the inner surface of the patella.  This was debrided using the 2.5 arthroscopic shaver.  It was noted to be quite smooth and postprocedure the patient was taken ________ well.  The knee was then copiously irrigated and suctioned dry and all instrumentation was removed.  20 cc of 0.25% Marcaine was then administered to each portal as well as intra-articularly.,Sterile dressing was then applied consisting of Adaptic, 4x4s, ABDs, and sterile Webril and a stockinette to the right lower extremity.  At this time, Department of Anesthesia reversed the anesthetic.  The patient was transferred back to the hospital gurney to the Postanesthesia Care Unit.  The patient tolerated the procedure and there were no complications.',\n",

Skin, subcutaneous tissue, and vertebral muscles divided longitudinally in the direction of the fibers and the trachea and esophagus was retracted medially.  The carotid sheath was retracted laterally after dissecting the longus colli muscle away from the vertebral osteophytes we could see very large osteophytes at C4-C5.  It appeared that the C5-C6 disk area had fused spontaneously.  We then confirmed that position by taking intraoperative x-rays and then proceeded to do discectomy and fusion at C3-C4, C4-C5.,After placing distraction screws and self-retaining retractors with the teeth beneath the bellies of the longus colli muscles, we then meticulously removed the disk at C3-C4, C4-C5 using the combination of angled strip, pituitary rongeurs, and curettes after we had incised the anulus fibrosus with #15 blade.,Next step was to totally decompress the spinal cord using the operating microscope and high-speed cutting followed by the diamond drill with constant irrigation.  We then drilled off the uncovertebral osteophytes and midline osteophytes as well as thinning out the posterior longitudinal ligaments.  This was then removed with 2-mm Kerrison rongeur.  After we removed the posterior longitudinal ligament, we could see the dura pulsating nicely.  We did foraminotomies at C3-C4 as well as C4-C5 as well.  After having totally decompressed both the cord as well as the nerve roots of C3-C4, C4-C5, we proceeded to the next step, which was a fusion.,We sized two 8-mm cortical cancellous grafts and after distracting the bone at C3-C4, C4-C5, we gently tapped the grafts into place.  The distraction was removed and the grafts were now within.  We went to the next step for the procedure, which was the instrumentation and stabilization of the fused area.,We then placed a titanium ABC plate from C3-C5, secured it with 16-mm titanium screws.  X-rays showed good position of the screws end plate.,The next step was to place Jackson-Pratt drain to the vertebral fascia.  Meticulous hemostasis was obtained.  The wound was closed in layers using 2-0 Vicryl for the subcutaneous tissue.  Steri-Strips were used for skin closure.  Blood loss less than about 200 mL.  No complications of the surgery.

My camera ports were then placed in the standard fan array.  A camera port was placed in the midline above the umbilicus using the Hasson technique.  The balloon port was placed, the abdomen insufflated, and all other ports were placed under direct vision.  My assistant was on the right.  The patient was then placed in the steep Trendelenburg position, and the robot brought forward and appropriately docked.,I then proceeded to drop the bladder into the peritoneal cavity by incising between the right and left medial umbilical ligaments and carrying that dissection laterally along these ligaments deep into the pelvis.  This nicely exposed the space of Retzius.  I then defatted the anterior surface of the prostate and endopelvic fascia.,The endopelvic fascia was then opened bilaterally.  The levator ani muscles were carefully dissected free from the prostate and pushed laterally.  Dissection was continued posteriorly toward the bundles and caudally to the apex.  The puboprostatic ligaments were then transected.  A secure ligature of 0 Vicryl was placed around the dorsal venous complex.,I then approached the bladder neck.  The anterior bladder neck was transected down to the level of the Foley catheter, which was lifted anteriorly in the wound.  I then transected the posterior bladder neck down to the level of the ampullae of the vas.  The ampullae were mobilized and transected.  These were lifted anteriorly in the field, exposing the seminal vesicles, which were similarly mobilized.  Hemostasis was obtained using the bipolar Bovie.,I then identified the Denonvilliers fascia, and this was incised sharply.  Dissection was continued caudally along the anterior surface of the rectum and laterally toward the bundles.  I was able to then identify the pedicles over the seminal vesicles, which were hemoclipped and transected.,The field was then copiously irrigated with sterile water.  Hemostasis was found to be complete.  I then carried out a urethrovesical anastomosis.  This was accomplished with 3-0 Monocryl ligatures.  Two of these were tied together in the midline.  They were placed at the 6 o'clock position, and one was run in a clockwise and the other in a counterclockwise direction to the 12 o'clock position where they were securely tied.  A new Foley catheter was then easily delivered into the bladder and irrigated without extravasation.  The patient was given indigo carmine, and there was prompt blue urine in the Foley., ,I then carried out a bladder suspension.  This was done in hopes of obtaining early urinary control.  This was accomplished with 0 Vicryl ligatures.  One was placed at the bladder neck and through the dorsal venous complex and then the other along the anterior surface of the bladder to the posterior surface of the pubis.  This nicely re-retroperitonealized the bladder.,The prostate was then placed in an Endocatch bag and brought out through an extended camera port incision.  A JP drain was brought in through the 4th arm port and sutured to the skin with 2-0 silk.  The camera port fascia was closed with running 0 Vicryl.  The skin incisions were closed with a running, subcuticular 4-0 Monocryl.,The patient tolerated the procedure very well.  There were no complications.  Sponge and instrument counts were reported correct at the end of the case.\",\n",
       " \"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Left canal cholesteatoma.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Left canal cholesteatoma.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE:,1.  Left canal wall down tympanomastoidectomy with ossicular chain reconstruction.,2.  Microdissection.,3.  NIM facial nerve monitoring for three hours.,COMPLICATIONS:  ,None.,FINDINGS:,  There is an extremely large canal cholesteatoma, which eroded most of the posterior and superior canal wall.  There was a significant amount of myringosclerosis and tympanosclerosis.  There is some mild erosion of the lenticular process of the incus.  The facial nerve was normal.  We removed the incus, removed the head of the malleus, and placed a titanium-PORP from the stapes capitulum to a cartilage graft.,PROCEDURE: , The patient was taken to the operating room, placed under general anesthetic and intubated without difficulty.  The NIM facial nerve monitoring electrodes were positioned and monitoring was performed throughout the procedure.  There was no abnormal activity during this case.  We inspected the ear canal, identified the huge defect, which was completely filled with cerumen.  Through the ear canal, we removed as much as we could and then infiltrated the canal and postauricular area with 1:100,000 of epinephrine.,We prepped and draped the ear in a sterile fashion.  We reopened the previously used postauricular incision and dissected down the mastoid cortex.  We reflected the soft tissues anteriorly to the level of the ear canal and identified where the ear canal skin entered the defect in the mastoid bone.  A #6 cutting bur was used to drill down the mastoid cortex and identified this cholesteatoma which was then carefully dissected out.  We went all the way to the mastoid antrum.  We finished a complete mastoidectomy with identification of the tegmen, sigmoid sinus.  We removed the lateral aspect of the mastoid tip.  We lowered the facial ridge.  The incudostapedial joint was already membranous in nature, we went ahead and used the joint knife and removed the incus.  We separated the incus from the stapes and then removed it.  We used a malleus head nipper to remove the head of the malleus and then we continued to saucerize the entire mastoid cavity.,There was no cholesteatoma within the middle ear space, but there was roughly 40% surface area perforation.  The remaining portion of the tympanic membrane was extremely calcified and myringosclerotic; this was removed.  There was also a large focus of tympanosclerosis between the stapes crura, which was impinging the ability of the stapes to move.  We carefully dissected this out.  This did seem to improve the mobility of the stapes somewhat.  At this point, there was a near total perforation.  There was only a minimal amount of anterior remnant of the drum left.  We tried to go ahead and harvest the temporalis fascia, but there was really only wisps of this fascia in place.  He had already had a previous tympanoplasty, but even outside the areas where the graft was taken, the temporalis muscle was quite atrophied and lumpy, and I suspect this was due to his chronic disease and long history of corticosteroid usage.  We harvested a few pieces as best as we could.  We went ahead and did a meatoplasty by making a canal incision in the 6 o'clock and 12 o'clock positions.  We excised cartilage posteriorly and inferiorly to enlarge the meatus.  This cartilage was thin and used for cartilage tympanoplasty.  We placed some Gelfoam in the middle ear space and placed the cartilage on the top of it.  We did cut a titanium-PORP of the proper side and placed on top of the stapes capitulum to interface with the cartilage cap.  A few other small pieces of temporalis fascia were used to bulge through the surrounding edges of the cartilage and make sure that it was medial to any remnant of ear canal and tympanic membrane remnants.  We placed a layer of Gelfoam lateral to the graft, closed the postauricular incision in layers and put 2 Merocel packs in the ear.  Glasscock dressing was applied.  The patient was awakened from anesthesia and taken to the recovery room in stable condition.  He will be given antibiotics and pain medicines and he will be given instructions to follow up with me in one week.\",\n",

The drops consisted of Cyclogyl 1%, Acular, and Neo-Synephrine 2.5 %.  Additionally, a peripheral IV was established by the anesthesia team.  Once the eye was dilated, the patient was wheeled to the operating suite.,Inside the operating suite, central monitoring lines were established.  Through the peripheral IV, the patient received intravenous sedation consisting of Propofol and once somnolent from this, retrobulbar block was administered consisting of 2 cc's of 2% Xylocaine  plain with 150 units of Wydase.  The block was administered in a retrobulbar fashion using an Atkinson needle and a good block was obtained.  Digital pressure was applied for approximately five minutes.,The patient was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion for ophthalmological surgery.  A Betadine prep was carried out of the face, lids, and eye.  During the draping process, care was taken to isolate the lashes.  A wire lid speculum was inserted to maintain patency of the lids.  With benefit of the operating microscope, a diamond blade was used to place a groove temporally.  A paracentesis wound was also placed temporally using the same blade.  Viscoelastic was then instilled into the anterior chamber through the paracentesis site and a 2.8 mm. diamond keratome was used to enter the anterior chamber through the previously placed groove.  The cystotome was then inserted into the eye and circular capsulorhexis was performed without difficulty.  The capsular remnant was withdrawn from the eye using long angled McPherson forceps.  Balanced salt solution with a blunt cannula was then inserted into the eye and hydrodissection was performed.  The lens was noted to rotate freely within the capsular bag.  The phaco instrument was then inserted into the eye using the Kelman tip.  The lens nucleus was grooved and broken into two halves.  One of the halves was in turn broken into quarters.  Each of the quarters was removed from the eye using the memory 2 settings and phacoemulsification.  Attention was then turned toward the remaining half of the nucleus and this, in turn, was removed as well, with the splitting maneuver.  Once the nucleus had been removed from the eye, the irrigating and aspirating tip was inserted and the cortical material was stripped out in sections.  Once the cortical material had been completely removed, a diamond dusted cannula was inserted into the eye and the posterior capsule was polished.  Viscoelastic was again instilled into the capsular bag as well as the anterior chamber.  The wound was enlarged slightly using the diamond keratome.  The above described intraocular lens was folded outside the eye using a mustache fold and inserted using folding forceps.  Once inside the eye, the lens was unfolded into the capsular bag in a single maneuver.  It was noted to be centered nicely.  The viscoelastic was then withdrawn from the eye using the irrigating and aspirating tip of the phaco machine.,Next, Miostat was instilled into the operative eye and the wound was checked for water tightness.  It was found to be such.  After removing the drapes and speculum, TobraDex drops were instilled into the operative eye and a gauze patch and Fox protective shield were placed over the eye.,The patient tolerated the procedure extremely well and was taken to the recovery area in good condition.  The patient is scheduled to be seen in follow-up in the office tomorrow, but should any complications arise this evening, the patient is to contact me immediately.\",\n",

Although this has been a very successful treatment in terms of her febrile seizure control, she is now having occasional brief periods of pauses and staring, where she becomes unresponsive, but does not lose her postural tone.  The typical spell according to dad last anywhere from 10 to 15 seconds, mom says 3 to 4 minutes, which likely means probably somewhere in the 30- to 40-second period of time.  Mom did note that an episode had happened outside of a store recently, was associated with some perioral cyanosis, but there has never been a convulsive activity noted.  There have been no recent changes in her Keppra dosing and she is currently only at 20 mg/kg per day, which is overall a low dose for her.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: , Born at 36 weeks' gestation by C-section delivery at 8 pounds 3 ounces.  She does have a history of febrile seizures and what parents reported an abdominal migraine, but on further questioning, it appears to be more of a food intolerance issue.,PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: , She has undergone no surgical procedures.,FAMILY MEDICAL HISTORY: , There is a strong history of epilepsy on the maternal side of family including mom with some nonconvulsive seizure during childhood and additional seizures in maternal great grandmother and a maternal great aunt.  There is no other significant neurological history on the paternal side of the family.,SOCIAL HISTORY: , Currently lives with her mom, dad, and two siblings.  She is at home full time and does not attend day care.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  ,Clear review of 10 systems are taken and revealed no additional findings other than those mentioned in the history of present illness.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,Vital Signs:  Weight was 15.6 kg.  She was afebrile.  Remainder of her vital signs were stable and within normal ranges for her age as per the medical record.,General:  She was awake, alert, and oriented.  She was in no acute distress, only slightly flustered when trying to place the EEG leads.,HEENT:  Showed normocephalic and atraumatic head.  Her conjunctivae were nonicteric and sclerae were clear.  Her eye movements were conjugate in nature.  Her tongue and mucous membranes were moist.,Neck:  Trachea appeared to be in the midline.,Chest:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally without crackles, wheezes or rhonchi.,Cardiovascular:  Showed a normal sinus rhythm without murmur.,Abdomen:  Showed soft, nontender, and nondistended, with good bowel sounds.  There was no hepatomegaly or splenomegaly, or other masses noted on examination.,Extremities:  Showed IV placement in the right upper extremity with appropriate restraints from the IV.  There was no evidence of clubbing, cyanosis or edema throughout.  She had no functional deformities in any of her peripheral limbs.,Neurological:  From neurological standpoint, her cranial nerves were grossly intact throughout.  Her strength was good in the bilateral upper and lower extremities without any distal to proximal variation.  Her overall resting tone was normal.  Sensory examination was grossly intact to light touch throughout the upper and lower extremities.  Reflexes were 1+ in bilateral patella.  Toes were downgoing bilaterally.  Coordination showed accurate striking ability and good rapid alternating movements.  Gait examination was deferred at this time due to EEG lead placement.,ASSESSMENT:,  A 2-1/2-year-old female with history of febrile seizures, now with concern for spells of unclear etiology, but somewhat concerning for partial complex seizures and to a slightly lesser extent nonconvulsive generalized seizures.,RECOMMENDATIONS,1.  For now, we will go ahead and try to capture EEG as long as she tolerates it; however, if she would require sedation, I would defer the EEG until further adjustments to seizure medications are made and we will see her response to these medications.,2.  As per the above, I will increase her Keppra to 300 mg p.o. b.i.d. bringing her to a total daily dose of just under 40 mg/kg per day.  If further spells are noted, we may increase upwards again to around 4.5 to 5 mL each day.,3.  I do not feel like any specific imaging needs to be done at this time until we see her response to the medication and review her EEG findings.  EEG, hopefully, will be able to be reviewed first thing tomorrow morning; however, I would not delay discharge the patient to wait on the EEG results.  The patient has been discharged and we will contact the family as an outpatient.,4.

He has underlying sinus bradycardia.  Therefore, will likely be pacing much of the time and would benefit from a biventricular pacing device.,RISKS AND BENEFITS:,  Risks, benefits, and alternatives to implantation of biventricular AICD and defibrillation threshold testing were discussed with the patient.  Risks including but not limited to bleeding, infection, vascular injury, cardiac perforation, stroke, myocardial infarction, the need for urgent cardiovascular surgery, and death were discussed with the patient.  The patient agreed both verbally and via written consent.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: , The patient was transported to the cardiac catheterization laboratory in the fasting state.  The region of the left deltopectoral groove was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.  Lidocaine 1% (20 mL) was administered to the area.  After achieving appropriate anesthesia, a percutaneous access of the left axillary vein was performed under fluoroscopy with two separate sticks.  Guidewires were advanced down into the left axillary vein.  Following this, a 4-inch long transverse incision was made through the skin and subcutaneous tissue exposing the pectoral fascia and muscle beneath.  Hemostasis was achieved with electrocautery.  Lidocaine 1% (10 mL) was administered to the medial aspect of the incision and a pocket was fashioned in the medial direction.  Using the more lateral of the guidewires, a 7-French side-arm sheath was advanced into the left axillary vein.  The dilator was removed and another wire was advanced down into the sheath.  The sheath was then backed up over the top of the two wires.  One wire was pinned to the drape and using the alternate wire, a 9-French side-arm sheath was advanced down into the left axillary vein.  The dilator and wire were removed.  A defibrillation lead was then advanced down into the atrium.  The peel-away sheath was removed.  The lead was then passed across the tricuspid valve and positioned in the apical septal location.  The active fix screw was deployed.  Adequate pacing and sensing functions were established.  A 10-volt pacing was used temporarily and there was no diaphragmatic stimulation.  The suture sleeve was advanced to the entry point of the tissue and connected securely to the tissue.  Using the wire that had been pinned to the drape, a 7-French side-arm sheath was advanced over this wire into the axillary vein.  The wire and dilator were removed.  An active pacing lead was then advanced down to the right atrium and the peel-away sheath was removed.  The lead was parked until a later time.  Using the separate access point, a 9-French side-arm sheath was advanced into the left axillary vein.  The dilator and wire were removed.  A curved outer sheath catheter as well as an inner catheter were advanced down into the area of the coronary sinus.  The coronary sinus was cannulated.  Inner catheter was removed and a balloon-tipped catheter was advanced into the coronary sinus.  A coronary sinus venogram was then performed.  It was noted that the most suitable location for lead placement was the middle cardiac vein.  This was cannulated and a passive lead was advanced over a Whisper EDS wire into a distal position.  Adequate pacing and sensing functions were established.  A 10-volt pacing was used temporarily.  There was no diaphragmatic stimulation.  The outer sheath was peeled away.  The 9 French sheath was then peeled away.  Suture sleeve was advanced to the entry point of the tissue and connected securely to the tissue.  At this point, the atrial lead was then positioned in the right atrial appendage using a preformed J-curved stylet.  The lead body was turned several times and the lead was affixed to the tissue.  Adequate pacing and sensing function were established.  A suture sleeve was advanced to the entry point of the tissue and connected securely to the tissue.  The pocket was then washed with antibiotic-impregnated saline.  Pulse generator was obtained and connected securely to the leads.  The leads were carefully wrapped behind the pulse generator and the entire system was placed in the pocket.  The pocket was then closed with 2-0, 3-0, and 4-0 Vicryl using a running mattress stitch.

He was unable to sustain enough caloric intake and had markedly decreased albumin stores.  After discussion with the patient and the son, they agreed to place a PEG tube for nutritional supplementation.,PROCEDURE: , After informed consent was obtained, the patient was brought to the endoscopy suite.  He was placed in the supine position and was given IV sedation by the Anesthesia Department.  An EGD was performed from above by Dr. X.  The stomach was transilluminated and an optimal position for the PEG tube was identified using the single poke method.  The skin was infiltrated with local and the needle and sheath were inserted through the abdomen into the stomach under direct visualization.  The needle was removed and a guidewire was inserted through the sheath.  The guidewire was grasped from above with a snare by the endoscopist.  It was removed completely and the Ponsky PEG tube was secured to the guidewire.,The guidewire and PEG tube were then pulled through the mouth and esophagus and snug to the abdominal wall.  There was no evidence of bleeding.  Photos were taken.  The Bolster was placed on the PEG site.  A complete dictation for the EGD will be done separately by Dr. X.

       " 'REASON FOR REFERRAL: , Ms. A is a 60-year-old African-American female with 12 years of education who was referred for neuropsychological evaluation by Dr. X after she demonstrated mild cognitive deficits on a neuropsychological screening evaluation during a followup appointment with him for stroke in July.  A comprehensive evaluation was requested to assess current cognitive functioning and assist with diagnostic decisions and treatment planning.,RELEVANT BACKGROUND INFORMATION:,  Historical information was obtained from a review of available medical records and clinical interview with Ms. A.  A summary of pertinent information is presented below.  Please refer to the patient\\'s medical chart for a more complete history.,HISTORY OF PRESENTING PROBLEM:,  Ms. A presented to the ABC Hospital emergency department on 07/26/2009 reporting that after she had woken up that morning she noticed numbness and weakness in her left hand, slurred speech, and left facial droop.  Neurological evaluation with Dr. X confirmed left hemiparesis.  Brain CT showed no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect and that she received TPA and had moderate improvement in left-sided weakness.  These symptoms were thought to be due to a right middle cerebral artery stroke.  She was transferred to the ICU for monitoring.  Ultrasound of the carotids showed 20% to 30% stenosis of the right ICA and 0% to 19% stenosis of the left ICA.  On 07/29/2009, she was admitted for acute inpatient rehabilitation for the treatment of residual functional deficits of her acute ischemic right MCA/CVA.  At discharge on 08/06/2009, she was mainly on supervision for all ADLs and walking with a rolling walker, but tolerating increased ambulation with a cane.  She was discharged home with recommendations for outpatient physical therapy.  She returned to the Sinai ER on 08/2009/2009 due to reported left arm pain, numbness, and weakness, which lasted 10 to 15 minutes and she reported that it felt \"just like the stroke.\"  Brain CT on 08/2009/2009 was read as showing \"mild chronic microvascular ischemic change of deep white matter,\" but no acute or significant interval change compared to her previous scan.  Neurological examination with Dr. Y was within normal limits, but she was admitted for a more extensive workup.  Due to left arm pain an ultrasound was completed on her left upper extremity, but it did not show deep vein thrombosis.,Followup CT on 08/10/2009 showed no significant interval change.  MRI could not be completed due to the patient\\'s weight.  She was discharged on 08/11/2009 in stable condition after it was determined that this event was not neurological in origin; however, note that Ms. A referred to this as a second stroke.,Ms. A presented for a followup outpatient neurological evaluation with Dr. X on 09/22/2009, at which time a brief neuropsychological screening was also conducted.  She demonstrated significant impairments in confrontation naming, abstract verbal reasoning, and visual and verbal memory and thus a more comprehensive evaluation was suggested due to her intent to return to her full-time work duty.  During the current interview, Ms. A reported that she noticed mild memory problems including some difficultly remembering conversations, events, and at times forgetting to take her medications.  She also reported mild difficulty finding words in conversation, solving novel problems and tasks (e.g. difficulty learning to use her camcorder), but overall denied significant cognitive deficits in attention, concentration, language or other areas of cognitive functioning.  When asked about her return to work, she said that she was still on light duty due to limited physical activity because of residual left leg weakness.  She reported that no one had indicated to her that she appeared less capable of performing her job duties, but said that she was also receiving fewer files to process and enter data into the computer at the Social Security Agency that she works at.  Note also that she had some difficulty explaining exactly what her job involved.  She also reported having problems falling asleep at work and that she is working full-time although on light duty.,OTHER MEDICAL HISTORY:  ,As mentioned, Ms. A continues to have some residual left leg weakness and continues to use a rolling walker for ambulation, but she reported that her motor functioning had improved significantly.  She was diagnosed with sleep apnea approximately two years ago and was recently counseled by Dr. X on the need to use her CPAP because she indicated she never used it at night.  She reported that since her appointment with Dr. X, she has been using it \"every other night.\"  When asked about daytime fatigue, Ms. A initially denied that she was having any difficulties, but repeatedly indicated that she was falling asleep at work and thought that it was due to looking at a computer screen.  She reported at times \"snoring\" and forgetting where she is at and said that a supervisor offered to give her coffee at one point.  She receives approximately two to five hours of sleep per night.  Other current untreated risk factors include obesity and hypercholesterolemia.  Her medical history is also significant for hypertension, asthma, abdominal adenocarcinoma status post hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, colonic benign polyps status post resection, benign lesions of the breast status post lumpectomy, and deep vein thrombosis in the left lower extremity status post six months of anticoagulation (which she had discontinued just prior to her stroke).,CURRENT MEDICATIONS: , Aspirin 81 mg daily, Colace 100 mg b.i.d., Lipitor 80 mg daily, and albuterol MDI p.r.n.,SUBSTANCE USE:,  Ms. A denied drinking alcohol or using illicit drugs.  She used to smoke a pack of cigarettes per day, but quit five to six years ago.,FAMILY MEDICAL HISTORY: , Ms. A had difficulty providing information on familial medical history.  She reported that her mother died three to four years ago from lung cancer.  Her father has gout and blood clots.  Siblings have reportedly been treated for asthma and GI tumors.  She was unsure of familial history of other conditions such as hypertension, high cholesterol, stroke, etc.,SOCIAL HISTORY: , Ms. A completed high school degree.  She reported that she primarily obtained B\\'s and C\\'s in school.  She received some tutoring for algebra in middle school, but denied ever having been held back a grade failing any classes or having any problems with attention or hyperactivity.,She currently works for the Social Security Administration in data processing.  As mentioned, she has returned to full-time work, but continues to perform only light duties due to her physical condition.  She is now living on her own.  She has never driven.  She reported that she continues to perform ADLs independently such as cooking and cleaning.  She lost her husband in 2005 and has three adult daughters.  She previously reported some concerns that her children wanted her to move into assisted living, but she did not discuss that during this current evaluation.  She also reported number of other family members who had recently passed away.  She has returned to activities she enjoys such as quire, knitting, and cooking and plans to go on a cruise to the Bahamas at the end of October.,PSYCHIATRIC HISTORY: , Ms. A did not report a history of psychological or psychiatric treatment.  She reported that her current mood was good, but did describe some anxiety and nervousness about various issues such as her return to work, her upcoming trip, and other events.  She reported that this only \"comes and goes.\",TASKS ADMINISTERED:,Clinical Interview,Adult History Questionnaire,Wechsler Test of Adult Reading (WTAR),Mini Mental Status Exam (MMSE),Cognistat Neurobehavioral Cognitive Status Examination,Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS; Form XX),Mattis Dementia Rating Scale, 2nd Edition (DRS-2),Neuropsychological Assessment Battery (NAB),Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, Third Edition (WAIS-III),Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, Fourth Edition (WAIS-IV),Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence (WASI),Test of Variables of Attention (TOVA),Auditory Consonant Trigrams (ACT),Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test (PASAT),Ruff 2 & 7 Selective Attention Test,Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT),Multilingual Aphasia Examination, Second Edition (MAE-II),  Token Test,  Sentence Repetition,  Visual Naming,  Controlled Oral Word Association,  Spelling Test,  Aural Comprehension,  Reading Comprehension,Boston Naming Test, Second Edition (BNT-2),Animal Naming Test',\n",

The patient had some mild hamstring tightness with his popliteal angle of approximately 20 degrees bilaterally.  He does not walk with a crouched gait but does toe walk.  Given his tightness, surgery versus observation was recommended to the family.  Family however wanted to correct his toe walking.  Surgery was then discussed.  Risks of surgery include risks of anesthesia, infection, bleeding, changes in sensation and motion of the extremities, failure to resolve toe walking, possible stiffness, cast, and cast problems.  All questions were answered and parents agreed to above surgical plan.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , The patient was taken to the operating room and placed supine on the operating table  General anesthesia was then administered.  The patient received Ancef preoperatively.  The patient was then subsequently placed prone with all bony prominences padded.  Two bilateral nonsterile tourniquets were placed on each thigh.  Both extremities were then prepped and draped in a standard surgical fashion.  We turned our attention first towards the left side.  A planned incision of 1 cm medial to the Achilles tendon was marked on the skin.  The extremity was wrapped in Esmarch prior to inflation of tourniquet to 250 mmHg.  Incision was then made and carried down through subcutaneous fat down to the tendon sheath.  Achilles tendon was identified and Z-lengthening was done with the medial distal half cut.  Once Z-lengthening was completed proximally, the length of the Achilles tendon was then checked.  This was trimmed to obtain an end-on-end repair with 0 Ethibond suture.  This was also oversewn.  Wound was then irrigated.  Achilles tendon sheath was reapproximated using 2-0 Vicryl as well as the subcutaneous fat.  The skin was closed using 4-0 Monocryl.  Once the wound was cleaned and dried and dressed with Steri-Strips and Xeroform, the area was injected with 0.5% Marcaine.  It was then dressed with 4 x 4 and Webril.  Tourniquet was released at 30 minutes.  The same procedure was repeated on the right side with tourniquet time of 21 minutes.  While the patient was still prone, two short-leg walking casts were then placed.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and was subsequently flipped supine on to hospital gurney and taken to PACU in stable condition.,POSTOPERATIVE PLAN:  ,The patient will be discharged on the day of surgery.  He may weightbear as tolerated in his cast, which he will have for about 4 to 6 weeks.  He is to follow up in approximately 10 days for recheck as well as prescription for intended AFOs, which he will need up to 6 months.  The patient may or may not need physical therapy while his Achilles lengthenings are healing.  The patient is not to participate in any PE for at least 6 months.  The patient is given Tylenol No. 3 for pain.',\n",

The patient was brought to the operative suite where he was placed in supine position and general endotracheal tube intubation was delivered by the Department of Anesthesia.  The patient was rotated 90 degrees away and a shoulder roll was placed and a McIvor mouthgag was inserted into the oral cavity.  Correct inspection and palpation did not reveal evidence of a bifid uvula or submucosal clots.  Attention was directed first to the right tonsil in which a curved Allis forceps was applied to the superior pole.  The needle-tip Bovie cautery was used to incise the mucosa of the anterior tonsillar pillar.  Once the tonsillar pillar was identified and the superior pole was released, the curved forceps with a straight Allis forceps and the dissection was carried down inferiorly, dissecting the tonsil free from all fascial attachments.  Once the tonsil was delivered from the oral cavity, hemostasis was obtained within the tonsillar fossa utilizing suction cautery.,Attention was then directed over to the left tonsil in which a similar procedure was performed.  Once all bleeding was controlled, the mucosa of both the hard and soft palate was anesthetized with a mixture of 1% lidocaine and 1:50000 epinephrine solution.  Now attention was directed to the posterior pillars.  A hemostat was used to clamp the posterior pillar, which was then taken down with Metzenbaum scissors.  The posterior pillar was then approximated to the anterior pillar with the use of #3-0 PDS suture so as to create a box shaped soft palate.  Now, the uvula was reflected onto the soft palate and #12 blade scalpel was used to incise the mucosa of the soft palate extending down onto the uvula.  The mucosa was dissected off with the use of Potts scissors.  Now the uvula was reflected onto the soft palate and sutured down in place with use of #3-0 PDS suture approximated with deep muscle layers.  Now the mucosa of the soft palate and the uvula were approximated with interrupted #3-0 PDS sutures.  Finally, #4-0 Vicryl sutures were placed intermittently between the PDS to further secure the uvula, which had been reflected onto the soft palate.  A final #3-0 PDS suture was used to further approximate the anterior and posterior tonsil pillars.  Final inspection did not reveal any further bleeding.  The mouth was then irrigated with saline and suctioned.  At this point, the procedure was complete.  He was awakened and taken to recovery room in stable condition.  He will be admitted as an observation patient to the Telemetry Floor for routine postoperative management.  Of note, IV Decadron was administered during the procedure.',\n",

This subsequently became infected.  She has undergone removal of this prosthesis and placement of antibiotic spacer.  She currently presents for stage II reconstruction with removal of antibiotic spacer and placement of a revision total hip.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was brought to the operating room by anesthesia personnel.  She was placed supine on the operating table.  A Foley catheter was inserted.  A formal time out was obtained in identifying the correct patient, operative site.  Preoperative antibiotics were held for intraoperative cultures.  The patient was placed into the lateral decubitus position with the right side up.  The previous surgical incision was identified.  The right lower extremity was prepped and draped in standard fashion.  The old surgical incision was reopened along its proximal extent.  Immediately encountered was a large amount of fibrous scar tissue.  Dissection was carried sharply down through this scar tissue.  Soft tissue plains were extremely difficult to visualize due to all the scarring.  There was no native tissue to orient oneself with.  We carried our dissection down through the scar tissue to what seemed to be a fascial layer.  We incised through the fascial layer down to some scarred gluteus maximus muscle and down over what was initially felt to be the greater trochanter.  Dissection was carried down through soft tissue and the distal located antibiotic spacer was exposed.  This was used as a landmark to orient remainder of the dissection.  The antibiotic spacer was exposed and followed distally to expose the proximal femur.  Dissection was continued posteriorly and proximally to expose the acetabulum.  A cobra retractor was able to be inserted across the superior aspect of the acetabulum to enhance exposure.  Once improved visualization was obtained, the antibiotic spacer was removed from the femur.  This allowed further improved visualization of the acetabulum.  The acetabulum was filled with soft tissue debris and scar tissue.  This was removed with sharp excision with a knife as well as with a rongeur and a Bovie.  Once soft tissue was removed, the acetabulum was reamed.  Reaming was started with a 46-mm reamer and carried up sequentially to prepare for 50-mm shell.  The 50 mm shell was trialed and had good stability and fit.  Attention was then turned to continue preparation of the femur.  The canal was then debrided with femoral canal curettes.  Some fibrous tissue was removed from the canal.  The length of the femoral stem was then checked with this canal curette in place.  Following x-rays, we prepared to begin reaming the femur.  This femur was reamed over a guide rod using flexible reaming rods.  The canal was reamed up to 13.5 mm distally in preparation for 14 mm stem.  The stem was selected and initially size A body was placed in trial.  The body was too tight proximally to fit.  The proximal canal was then reamed for a size AA body.  A longer stem with an anterior bow was selected and a size AA trial was assembled.  This fit nicely in the canal and had good fit and fill.  Intraoperative radiographs were obtained to determine component position.  Intraoperative radiographs revealed satisfactory length of the component past the distal of fractures in the femur.  The remainder of the trial was then assembled and the hip was relocated and trialed.  Initially, it was found to be unstable posteriorly.  We changed from a 10 degree lip liner to 20 degree lip liner.  Again, the hip was trialed and found to be unstable posteriorly.  This was due to reversion of the femoral component.  As we attempted to seat the prosthesis, the stent continued to attempt to turn in retroversion.  The stem was extracted and retrialed.  Improved stability was obtained and we decided to proceed with the real components.  A 20 degree liner was inserted into the acetabular shell.  The real femoral components were assembled and inserted into the femoral canal.  Again, the hip was trialed.  The components were found to be in relative retroversion.  The real components were then backed down and the neck was placed in the more anteversion and reinserted.  Again, the stem attempted to follow in the relative retroversion.  Along with this time, however, it was improved from previous attempts.  The femoral head trial was placed back on the components and the hip relocated.  It was taken to a range of motion and found to have improved stability compared to previous trialing.  Decision was made to accept the component position.  The real femoral head was selected and implanted.  The hip was then taken again to a range of motion.  It was stable at 90 degrees of flexion with 20 degrees of adduction and 40 degrees of internal rotation.  The patient reached full extension and had no instability anteriorly.,The wound was then irrigated again with pulsatile lavage.  Six liters of pulsatile lavage was used during the procedure.,The wound was then closed in a layered fashion.  A Hemovac drain was placed deep to the fascial layer.  The subcutaneous tissues were closed with #1 PDS, 2-0 PDS, and staples in the skin.  An incisional VAC was then placed over the wound as well.  Sponge and needle counts were correct at the close of the case.,DISPOSITION:,  The patient will be weightbearing as tolerated with posterior hip precautions.',\n",

The baby was delivered from the right sacral anterior position without any difficulty.  Apgars 8 and 9.  Weight was 7.5 lb.,INDICATIONS FOR THIS PROCEDURE:  ,The patient is a 23-year-old G3 P 2-0-0-2 with reported 30 and 4/7th weeks' for a scheduled cesarean section secondary to repeat x2.  She had her first C-section because of congenial hip problems.  In her second C-section, baby was breached, therefore, she is scheduled for a third C-section.  The patient also requests sterilization.  Therefore, she requested a tubal ligation.,PROCEDURE: , After informed consent was obtained and all questions were answered to the patient's satisfaction in layman's terms, she was taken to the operating room where a spinal with Astramorph anesthesia was obtained without any difficulty.  She was placed in the dorsal supine position with a leftward tilt and prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  A Pfannenstiel skin incision was made removing the old scar with a first knife and then carried down to the underlying layer of fascia with a second knife.  The fascia was excised in the midline extended laterally with the Mayo scissors.  The superior aspect of the fascial incision was then tented up with Ochsner clamps and the underlying rectus muscle dissected off sharply with the Metzenbaum scissors.  There was noted dense adhesions at this point as well as a wire mesh was noted.  The anterior aspect of the fascial incision was then tented up with Ochsner clamps and the underlying rectus muscle dissected off sharply as well as bluntly.  The rectus muscle superiorly was opened with a hemostat.  The peritoneum was identified and entered bluntly digitally.  The peritoneal incision was then extended superiorly up to the level of the mesh.  Then, inferiorly using the knife, the adhesions were taken down and the bladder was identified and the peritoneum incision extended inferiorly to the level of the bladder.  The bladder blade was inserted and vesicouterine peritoneum was identified and tented up with Allis clamps and bladder flap was created sharply with the Metzenbaum scissors digitally.  The bladder blade was then reinserted to protect the bladder and the uterine incision was made with a first knife and then extended laterally with the Bandage scissors.  The amniotic fluid was noted to be clear.  At this point, upon examining the intrauterine contents, the baby was noted to be breached.  The right foot was identified and then the baby was delivered from the double footling breach position without any difficulty.  The cord was clamped and the baby was then handed off to awaiting pediatricians.  The placenta cord gases were obtained and the placenta was then manually extracted from the uterus.  The uterus was exteriorized and cleared of all clots and debris.  Then, the uterine incision was then closed with #0 Vicryl in a double closure stitch fashion, first layer in locking stitch fashion and the second layer an imbricating layer.  Attention at this time was turned to the tubes bilaterally.,Both tubes were isolated and followed all the way to the fimbriated end and tented up with the Babcock clamp.  The hemostat was probed through the mesosalpinx in the avascular area and then a section of tube was clamped off with two hemostats and then transected with the Metzenbaum scissors.  The ends was then burned with the cautery and then using a #2-0 Vicryl suture tied down.  Both tube sections were noted to be hemostatic and the tubes were then sent to pathology for review.  The uterus was then replaced back into the abdomen.  The gutters were cleared of all clots and debris.  The uterine incision was then once again inspected and noted to be hemostatic.  The bladder flap was then replaced back into the uterus with #3-0 interrupted sutures.  The peritoneum was then closed with #3-0 Vicryl in a running fashion.  Then, the area at the fascia where the mesh had been cut and approximately 0.5 cm portion was repaired with #3-0 Vicryl in a simple stitch fashion.  The fascia was then closed with #0 Vicryl in a running fashion.  The subcutaneous layer and Scarpa's fascia were repaired with a #3-0 Vicryl.  Then, the skin edges were reapproximated using sterile clips.  The dressing was placed.  The uterus was then cleared of all clots and debris manually.  Then, the patient tolerated the procedure well.  Sponge, lap, and needle, counts were correct x2.  The patient was taken to recovery in sable condition.

There was a good brachial pulse palpated.  The artery was cannulated with the provided needle and the kit.  There was good arterial blood return noted immediately.  On the first stick, the Seldinger wire was inserted through the needle to cannulate the right brachial artery without difficulty.  The needle was removed and a catheter was inserted over the Seldinger wire to cannulate the brachial artery.  The femoral catheter was used in this case secondary to the patient's severe edema and anasarca.  We did not feel that the shorter catheter would provide enough length.  The catheter was connected to the system and flushed without difficulty.  A good waveform was noted.  The catheter was sutured into place with #3-0 silk suture and OpSite dressing was placed over this.,2.  RIGHT SUBCLAVIAN TRIPLE LUMEN CATHETER:  ,The patient was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  1% Xylocaine was used to anesthetize an area just inferior and lateral to the angle of the clavicle.  Using the anesthetic needle, we checked down to the soft tissues anesthetizing, as we proceeded to the angle of the clavicle, this was also anesthetized.  Next, a #18 gauge thin walled needle was used following the same track to the angle of clavicle.  We roughed the needle down off the clavicle and directed it towards the sternal notch.  There was good venous return noted immediately.  The syringe was removed and a Seldinger guidewire was inserted through the needle to cannulate the vein.  The needle was then removed.  A small skin nick was made with a #11 blade scalpel and the provided dilator was used to dilate the skin, soft tissue and vein.  Next, the triple lumen catheter was inserted over the guidewire without difficulty.  The guidewire was removed.  All the ports aspirated and flushed without difficulty.  The catheter was sutured into place with #3-0 silk suture and a sterile OpSite dressing was also applied.  The patient tolerated the above procedures well.

Placement of anterior spinal instrumentation from C3 to C6 using a Synthes Small Stature Plate, using the operating microscope and microdissection technique.,INDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURE: , This 62-year-old man has severe cervical spondylosis with myelopathy and cord compression at C5-C6.  There was a herniated disk with cord compression and radiculopathy at C4-C5.  C3-C4 was the source of neck pain as documented by facet injections.,A detailed discussion ensued with the patient as to the pros and cons of the surgery by two levels versus three levels.  Because of the severe component of the neck pain that has been relieved with facet injections, we elected to proceed ahead with anterior cervical discectomy and fusion at C3-C4, C4-C5, and C5-C6.,I explained the nature of this procedure in great detail including all risks and alternatives.  He clearly understands and has no further questions and requests that I proceed.,PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was placed on the operating room table and was intubated taking great care to keep the neck in a neutral position.  The methylprednisolone spinal cord protocol was instituted with bolus and continuous infusion dosages.,The left side of the neck was carefully prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.,A transverse incision was made in the neck crease.  Dissection was carried down through the platysma musculature and the anterior spine was exposed.  The medial borders of the longus colli muscle were dissected free from their attachments to the spine.  Caspar self-retaining pins were placed into the bodies of C3, C4, C5, and C6 and x-ray localization was obtained.  A needle was placed in what was revealed to be the disk space at C4-C5 and an x-ray confirmed proper localization.,Self-retaining retractors were then placed in the wound, taking great care to keep the blades of the retractors underneath the longus colli muscles.,First I removed the large amount of anterior overhanging osteophytes at C5-C6 and distracted the space.  The high-speed cutting bur was used to drill back the osteophytes towards the posterior lips of the vertebral bodies.,An incision was then made at C4-C5 and the annulus was incised and a discectomy was performed back to the posterior lips of the vertebral bodies.,The retractors were then adjusted and again discectomy was performed at C3-C4 back to the posterior lips of the vertebral bodies.  The operating microscope was then utilized.,Working under magnification, I started at C3-C4 and began to work my way down to the posterior longitudinal ligament.  The ligament was incised and the underlying dura was exposed.  I worked out laterally towards the takeoff of the C4 nerve root and widely decompressed the nerve root edge of the foramen.  There were a large number of veins overlying the nerve root which were oozing and rather than remove these and produce tremendous amount of bleeding, I left them intact.  However, I could to palpate the nerve root along the pedicle into the foramen and widely decompressed it on the right.  The microscope was angled to the left side where similar decompression was achieved.,The retractors were readjusted and attention was turned to C4-C5.  I worked down through bony osteophytes and identified the posterior longitudinal ligament.  The ligament was incised; and as I worked to the right of the midline, I encountered herniated disk material which was removed in a number of large pieces.  The C5 root was exposed and then widely decompressed until I was flush with the pedicle and into the foramen.  The root had a somewhat high takeoff but I worked to expose the axilla and widely decompressed it.  Again the microscope was angled to the left side where similar decompression was achieved.  Central decompression was achieved here where there was a moderate amount of spinal cord compression.  This was removed by undercutting with 1 and 2-mm Cloward punches.,Attention was then turned to the C5-C6 space.  Here there were large osteophytes projecting posteriorly against the cord.  I slowly and carefully used the high-speed cutting diamond bur to drill these and then used 1 to 2-mm Cloward punches to widely decompress the spinal cord.  This necessitated undercutting the bodies of both C5 and C6 extensively, but I was then able to achieve a good decompression of the cord.  I exposed the C6 root and widely decompressed it until I was flush with the pedicle and into the foramen on the right.  The microscope was angled to the left side where a similar decompression was achieved.,Attention was then turned to creation of the arthrodesis.  A high-speed Cornerstone bur was used to decorticate the bodies of C5-C6, C4-C5 and C3-C4 to create a posterior shelf to prevent backwards graft migration.  Bone dust during the drilling was harvested for later use.,Attention was turned to creation of the arthrodesis.  Using the various Synthes sizers, I selected a 7-mm lordotic graft at C5-C6 and an 8-mm lordotic graft at C4-C5 and a 9-mm lordotic graft at C3-C4.  Each graft was filled with autologous bone from the vertebral bodies and bone morphogenetic protein soaked sponge.  I decided to use BMP in this case because there were three levels of fusion and because this patient has a very heavy history of smoking and having just recently discontinued for two weeks.  The BMP sponge and the ____________ bone were then packed in the center of the allograft.,Under distraction, the graft was placed at C3-C4, C4-C5, and C5-C6 as described.  An x-ray was obtained which showed good graft placement with preservation of the cervical lordosis.,Attention was turned to the placement of anterior spinal instrumentation.  Various sizes of Synthes plates were selected until I decided that a 54-mm plate was appropriate.  The plate had to be somewhat contoured and bent inferiorly and the vertebral bodies had to be drilled so that the plates would sit flush.  The holes were drilled and the screws were placed.  Eight screws were placed with two screws at C3, two screws at C4, two screws at C5, and two screws at C6.  All eight screws had good purchase.  The locking screws were tightly applied.  An x-ray was obtained which showed good placement of the graft, plate, and screws.,Attention was turned to closure.  The wound was copiously irrigated with Bacitracin solution and meticulous hemostasis was obtained.  A medium Hemovac drain was placed in the anterior vertebral body space and brought out through a separate stab incision in the skin.  The wound was then carefully closed in layers.  Sterile dressings were applied, and the operation was terminated.,The patient tolerated the procedure well and left for the recovery room in excellent condition.  The sponge and needle counts were reported as correct.  There were no intraoperative complications.,Specimens were sent to Pathology consisting of disk material and bone and soft tissue.',\n",

The patient had A-line triple-lumen catheter.  The patient was placed in left side up, right side down oblique position.  All the pressure points were well padded.  The right fistula was carefully padded completely around it.  Axilla was protected.  The fistula was checked throughout the procedure to ensure that it was stable.  The arms, ankles, knees, and joints were all padded with foam.  The patient was taped to the table using 2-inch wide tape.  OG and a Foley catheter were in place.  A supraumbilical incision was made about 6 cm in size and incision was carried through the subcutaneous tissue and through the fascia and peritoneum was entered sharply.  There were some adhesions where the omentum was into the umbilical hernia, which was completely stuck.  The omentum was released out of that just so we could obtain pneumoperitoneum.  Pneumoperitoneum was obtained after using GelPort.  Two 12-mm ports were placed in the left anterior axillary line, and mid clavicular line.  The colon was reflected medially.  Kidney was dissected laterally behind and inferiorly.  There was large hematoma visualized with significant amount of old blood, which was irrigated out.  Dissection was carried superiorly and the spleen was reflected medially.  The spleen and colon were all intact at the end of the procedure.  They were stable all throughout.  Using endovascular GIA stapler, all the medial and lateral dissection was carried through the stapler to ensure that the patient had minimal bleeding due to low cardiac reserve.  Hemostasis was obtained.  The renal vein and the renal artery were stapled and there was excellent hemostasis.,The dissection was carried lateral to the adrenal and medial to the right kidney.  The adrenal was preserved.  The entire kidney was removed through the hand port.  Irrigation was performed.  There was excellent hemostasis at the end of the nephrectomy.  Fibrin glue and Surgicel were applied just in case the patient had delayed DIC.  The colon was placed back and 12-mm ports were closed under direct palpation using 0 Vicryl.  The fascia was closed using loop #1 PDS in a running fashion and was tied in the middle.  Please note that prior to the fascial closure, the peritoneum was closed using 0 Vicryl in running fashion.  The subcuticular tissue was brought together using 4-0 Vicryl.  The skin was closed using 4-0 Monocryl.  Dermabond was applied.  The patient was brought to the recovery in a stable condition.',\n",

       " 'PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Foraminal disc herniation of left L3-L4.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:,1.  Foraminal disc herniation of left L3-L4.,2.  Enlarged dorsal root ganglia of the left L3 nerve root.,PROCEDURE PERFORMED:, Transpedicular decompression of the left L3-L4 with discectomy.,ANESTHESIA:,  General.,COMPLICATIONS: , None.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: , Minimal.,SPECIMEN: , None.,HISTORY: , This is a 55-year-old female with a four-month history of left thigh pain.  An MRI of the lumbar spine has demonstrated a mass in the left L3 foramen displacing the nerve root, which appears to be a foraminal disc herniation effacing the L3 nerve root.  Upon exploration of the nerve root, it appears that there was a small disc herniation in the foramen, but more impressive was the abnormal size of the dorsal root ganglia that was enlarged more medially than laterally.  There was no erosion into the bone surrounding the area rather in the pedicle above or below or into the vertebral body, so otherwise the surrounding anatomy is normal.  I was prepared to do a discectomy and had not consented the patient for a biopsy of the nerve root.  But because of the sequela of cutting into a nerve root with residual weakness and persistent pain that the patient would suffer, at this point I was not able to perform this biopsy without prior consent from the patient.  So, surgery ended decompressing the L3 foramen and providing a discectomy with idea that we will obtain contrasted MRIs in the near future and I will discuss the findings with the patient and make further recommendations.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE: , The patient was taken to OR #5 at ABCD General Hospital in a gurney.  Department of Anesthesia administered general anesthetic.  Endotracheal intubation followed.  The patient received the Foley catheter.  She was then placed in a prone position on a Jackson table.  Bony prominences were well padded.  Localizing x-rays were obtained at this time and the back was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  A midline incision was made over the L3-L4 disc space taking through subcutaneous tissues sharply, dissection was then carried out to the left of the midline with lumbodorsal fascia incised and the musculature was elevated in a supraperiosteal fashion from the level of L3.  Retractors were placed into the wound to retract the musculature.  At this point, the pars interarticularis was identified and the facet joint of L2-L3 was identified.  A marker was placed over the pedicle of L3 and confirmed radiographically.  Next, a microscope was brought onto the field.  The remainder of the procedure was noted with microscopic visualization.  A high-speed drill was used to remove the small portions of the lateral aspects of the pars interarticularis.  At this point, soft tissue was removed with a Kerrison rongeur and the nerve root was clearly identified in the foramen.  As the disc space of L3-L4 is identified, there is a small prominence of the disc, but not as impressive as I would expect on the MRI.  A discectomy was performed at this time removing only small portions of the lateral aspect of the disc.  Next, the nerve root was clearly dissected out and visualized, the lateral aspect of the nerve root appears to be normal in structural appearance.  The medial aspect with the axilla of the nerve root appears to be enlarged.  The color of the tissue was consistent with a nerve root tissue.  There was no identifiable plane and this is a gentle enlargement of the nerve root.  There are no circumscribed lesions or masses that can easily be separated from the nerve root.  As I described in the initial paragraph, since I was not prepared to perform a biopsy on the nerve and the patient had not been consented, I do not think it is reasonable to take the patient to this procedure, because she will have persistent weakness and pain in the leg following this procedure.  So, at this point there is no further decompression.  A nerve fork was passed both ventral and dorsal to the nerve root and there was no compression for lateral.  The pedicle was palpated inferiorly and medially and there was no compression, as the nerve root can be easily moved medially.  The wound was then irrigated copiously and suctioned dry.  A concoction of Duramorph and ______ was then placed over the nerve root for pain control.  The retractors were removed at this point.  The fascia was reapproximated with #1 Vicryl sutures, subcutaneous tissues with #2 Vicryl sutures, and Steri-Strips covering the incision.  The patient transferred to the hospital gurney, extubated by Anesthesia, and subsequently transferred to Postanesthesia Care Unit in stable condition.',\n",

Dissection was carried down to the antebrachial fascia, which was cut in a distally based fashion.  Bipolar electrocautery was used to maintain meticulous hemostasis.  I then performed an antebrachial fasciotomy proximally.  I entered the extra bursal space deep into the transverse carpal ligament and used the spatula probe and then the dilators and then the square probe to enlarge the area.  Great care was taken to feel the washboard undersurface of the transverse carpal ligament and the hamate on the ulnar side.  Great care was taken with placement.  A good plane was positively identified.  I then placed the endoscope in and definitely saw the transverse striations of the deep surface of the transverse carpal ligament.,Again, I felt the hook of the hamate ulnar to me.  I had my thumb on the distal aspect of the transverse carpal ligament.  I then partially deployed the blade, and starting 1 mm from the distal edge, the transverse carpal ligament was positively identified.  I pulled back and cut and partially tightened the transverse carpal ligament.  I then feathered through the distal ligament and performed a full-thickness incision through the distal half of the ligament.  I then checked to make sure this was properly performed and then cut the proximal aspect.  I then entered the carpal tunnel again and saw that the release was complete, meaning that the cut surfaces of the transverse carpal ligament were separated; and with the scope rotated, I could see only one in the field at a time.  Great care was taken and at no point was there any longitudinal structure cut.  Under direct vision through the incision, I made sure that the distal antebrachial fascia was cut.  Following this, I irrigated and closed the skin.  The patient was dressed and sent to the recovery room in good condition.',\n",

       " \"HISTORY:,  The patient is 14 months old, comes in with a chief complaint of difficulty breathing.  Difficulty breathing began last night.  He was taken to Emergency Department where he got some Xopenex, given a prescription for amoxicillin and discharged home.  They were home for about an hour when he began to get worse and they drove here to Children's Hospital.  He has a history of reactive airway disease.  He has been seen here twice in the last month on 10/04/2007 and 10/20/2007, both times with some wheezing.  He was diagnosed with pneumonia back on 06/12/2007 here in the Emergency Department but was not admitted at that time.  He has been on albuterol off and on over that period.  He has had fever overnight.  No vomiting, no diarrhea.  Increased work of breathing with retractions and audible wheezes noted and thus brought to the Emergency Department.  Normal urine output.  No rashes have been seen.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: , As noted above.  No hospitalizations, surgeries, allergies.,MEDICATIONS: , Xopenex.,IMMUNIZATIONS:,  Up-to-date.,BIRTH HISTORY:,  The child was full term, no complications, home with mom.  No surgeries.,FAMILY HISTORY: , Negative.,SOCIAL HISTORY: , No smokers or pets in the home.  No ill contacts, no travel, no change in living condition.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: , Ten are asked, all are negative, except as noted above.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,VITAL SIGNS:  Temp 37.1, pulse 158, respiratory rate 48, 84% on room air indicating hypoxia.,GENERAL:  The child is awake, alert, in moderate respiratory distress.,HEENT:  Pupils equal, round, reactive to light.  Extraocular movements are intact.  The TMs are clear.  The nares show some dry secretions.  Audible congestion and wheezing is noted.  Mucous membranes are dry.  Throat is clear.  No oral lesions noted.,NECK:  Supple without lymphadenopathy or masses.  Trachea is midline.,LUNGS:  Show inspiratory and expiratory wheezes in all fields.  Audible wheezes are noted.  There are intercostal and subcostal retractions and suprasternal muscle use is noted.,HEART:  Shows tachycardia.  Regular rhythm.  Normal S1, S2.  No murmur.,ABDOMEN:  Soft, nontender.  Positive bowel sounds.  No guarding.  No rebound.  No hepatosplenomegaly.,EXTREMITIES:  Capillary refill is brisk.  Good distal pulses.,NEUROLOGIC:  Cranial nerves II through XII intact.  Moves all 4 extremities equally and normally.,HOSPITAL COURSE: , The child has an IV placed.  I felt the child was dehydrated on examination.  We gave 20 mL/kg bolus of normal saline over one hour.  The child was given Solu-Medrol 2 mg/kg IV.  He was initially started on unit dose albuterol and Atrovent but high-dose albuterol for continuous nebulization was ordered.,A portable chest x-ray was done showing significant peribronchial thickening bilaterally.  Normal heart size.  No evidence of pneumothorax.  No evidence of focal pneumonia.  After 3 unit dose of albuterol/Atrovent breathing treatments, there was much better air exchange bilaterally but still with inspiratory/expiratory wheezes and high-dose continuous albuterol was started at that time.  The child was monitored closely while on high-dose albuterol and slowly showed improvement resulting in only expiratory wheezes after one hour.  The child's pulse ox on breathing treatments with 100% oxygen was 100%.  Respiratory rate remained about 40 to 44 breaths per minute indicating tachypnea.  The child's color improved with oxygen therapy, and the capillary refill was always less than 2 seconds.,The child has failed outpatient therapy at this time.  After 90 minutes of continuous albuterol treatment, the child still has expiratory wheezes throughout.  After I removed the oxygen, the pulse ox was down at 91% indicating hypoxia.  The child has a normal level of alertness; however, has not had any vomiting here.  I spoke with Dr. X, on call for hospitalist service.  She has come down and evaluated the patient.  We both feel that since this child had two ER visits this last month, one previous ER visit within the last 5 hours, we should admit the child for continued albuterol treatments, IV steroids, and asthma teaching for the family.  The child is admitted in a stable condition.,DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSES:  ,Ruled out pneumothorax, pneumonia, bronchiolitis, croup.,TIME SPENT:  ,Critical care time outside billable procedures was 45 minutes with this patient.,IMPRESSION:  ,Status asthmaticus, hypoxia.,PLAN:  ,Admitted to Pediatrics.\",\n",
       " 'Dear Sample Doctor:,Thank you for referring Mr. Sample Patient for cardiac evaluation.  This is a 67-year-old, obese male who has a history of therapy-controlled hypertension, borderline diabetes, and obesity.  He has a family history of coronary heart disease but denies any symptoms of angina pectoris or effort intolerance.  Specifically, no chest discomfort of any kind, no dyspnea on exertion unless extreme exertion is performed, no orthopnea or PND.  He is known to have a mother with coronary heart disease.  He has never been a smoker.  He has never had a syncopal episode, MI, or CVA.  He had his gallbladder removed.  No bleeding tendencies.  No history of DVT or pulmonary embolism.  The patient is retired, rarely consumes alcohol and consumes coffee moderately.  He apparently has a sleep disorder, according to his wife (not in the office), the patient snores and stops breathing during sleep.  He is allergic to codeine and aspirin (angioedema).,Physical exam revealed a middle-aged man weighing 283 pounds for a height of 5 feet 11 inches.  His heart rate was 98 beats per minute and regular.  His blood pressure was 140/80 mmHg in the right arm in a sitting position and 150/80 mmHg in a standing position.  He is in no distress.  Venous pressure is normal.  Carotid pulsations are normal without bruits.  The lungs are clear.  Cardiac exam was normal.  The abdomen was obese and organomegaly was not palpated.  There were no pulsatile masses or bruits.  The femoral pulses were 3+ in character with a symmetrical distribution and dorsalis pedis and posterior tibiales were 3+ in character.  There was no peripheral edema.  ,He had a chemistry profile, which suggests diabetes mellitus with a fasting blood sugar of 136 mg/dl.  Renal function was normal.  His lipid profile showed a slight increase in triglycerides with normal total cholesterol and HDL and an acceptable range of LDL.  His sodium was a little bit increased.  His A1c hemoglobin was increased.  He had a spirometry, which was reported as normal.  ,He had a resting electrocardiogram on December 20, 2002, which was also normal.  He had a treadmill Cardiolite, which was performed only to stage 2 and was terminated by the supervising physician when the patient achieved 90% of the predicted maximum heart rate.  There were no symptoms or ischemia by EKG.  There was some suggestion of inferior wall ischemia with normal wall motion by Cardiolite imaging.,In summary, we have a 67-year-old gentleman with risk factors for coronary heart disease.  I am concerned with possible diabetes and a likely metabolic syndrome of this gentleman with truncal obesity, hypertension, possible insulin resistance, and some degree of fasting hyperglycemia, as well as slight triglyceride elevation.  He denies any symptoms of coronary heart disease, but he probably has some degree of coronary atherosclerosis, possibly affecting the inferior wall by functional testings.  ,In view of the absence of symptoms, medical therapy is indicated at the present time, with very aggressive risk factor modification.  I explained and discussed extensively with the patient, the benefits of regular exercise and a walking program was given to the patient.  He also should start aggressively losing weight.  I have requested additional testing today, which will include an apolipoprotein B, LPa lipoprotein, as well as homocystine, and cardio CRP to further assess his risk of atherosclerosis.  ,In terms of medication, I have changed his verapamil for a long acting beta-blocker, he should continue on an ACE inhibitor and his Plavix.  The patient is allergic to aspirin.  I also will probably start him on a statin, if any of the studies that I have recommended come back abnormal and furthermore, if he is confirmed to have diabetes.  Along this line, perhaps, we should consider obtaining the advice of an endocrinologist to decide whether this gentleman needs treatment for diabetes, which I believe he should.  This, however, I will leave entirely up to you to decide.  If indeed, he is considered to be a diabetic, a much more aggressive program should be entertained for reducing the risks of atherosclerosis in general, and coronary artery disease in particular.,I do not find an indication at this point in time to proceed with any further testing, such as coronary angiography, in the absence of symptoms.,If you have any further questions, please do not hesitate to let me know.,Thank you once again for this kind referral.,Sincerely,,Sample Doctor, M.D.',\n",

       " \"REASON FOR CONSULTATION:,  Acute deep venous thrombosis, right lower extremity with bilateral pulmonary embolism, on intravenous heparin complicated with acute renal failure for evaluation.,HISTORY OF PRESENTING ILLNESS:  ,Briefly, this is a 36-year-old robust Caucasian gentleman with no significant past medical or surgical history, who works as a sales representative, doing a lot of traveling by plane and car and attending several sales shows, developed acute shortness of breath with an episode of syncope this weekend and was brought in by paramedics to Hospital.  A V/Q scan revealed multiple pulmonary perfusion defects consistent with high probability pulmonary embolism.  A Doppler venous study of the lower extremity also revealed nonocclusive right popliteal vein thrombosis.  A CT of the abdomen and pelvis revealed normal-appearing liver, spleen, and pancreas; however, the right kidney appeared smaller compared to left and suggesting possibility of renal infarct.  Renal function on admission was within normal range; however, serial renal function showed rapid increase in creatinine to 5 today.  He has been on intravenous heparin and hemodialysis is being planned for tomorrow.  Reviewing his history, there is no family members with hypercoagulable state or prior history of any thrombotic complication.  He denies any recent injury to his lower extremity and in fact denied any calf pain or swelling.,PAST MEDICAL AND SURGICAL HISTORY:  ,Unremarkable.,SOCIAL HISTORY: , He is married and has 1 son.  He has a brother who is healthy.  There is no history of tobacco use or alcohol use.,FAMILY HISTORY:,  No family history of hypercoagulable condition.,MEDICATIONS:  ,Advil p.r.n.,ALLERGIES: , NONE.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: , Essentially unremarkable except for sudden onset dyspnea on easy exertion complicated with episode of syncope.  He denied any hemoptysis.  He denied any calf swelling or pain.  Lately, he has been traveling and has been sitting behind a desk for a long period of time.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,GENERAL:  He is a robust young gentleman, awake, alert, and hemodynamically stable.,HEENT:  Sclerae anicteric.

Liver profile normal.  Thyroid study revealed a TSH of 1.3.  Prothrombin time/INR 1.5, partial thromboplastin time 78.6 seconds.  Renal function, BUN 44 and creatinine 5.7.  Echocardiogram revealed left ventricular hypertrophy with ejection fraction of 65%, no intramural thrombus noted.,IMPRESSION:,1.  Bilateral pulmonary embolism, most consistent with emboli from right lower extremity, on intravenous heparin, rule out hereditary hypercoagulable state.,2.  Leukocytosis, most likely leukemoid reaction secondary to acute pulmonary embolism/renal infarction, doubt presence of myeloproliferative disorder.,3.  Acute renal failure secondary to embolic right renal infarction.,4.  Obesity.,PLAN: , From hematologic standpoint, we will await hypercoagulable studies, which have all been sent on admission to see if a hereditary component is at play.  For now, we will continue intravenous heparin and subsequent oral anticoagulation with Coumadin.  In view of worsening renal function, may need temporary hemodialysis until renal function improves.  I discussed at length with the patient's wife at the bedside.\",\n",

Inflammatory synovitis from the volar radial wrist area.,2.  Inflammatory synovitis from the dorsal wrist area.,DRAINS:,  None.,PROCEDURE DETAIL: , Patient brought to the operating room.  After induction of IV sedation a right upper extremity axillary block anesthetic was performed by anesthesia staff.  Routine prep and drape was employed.  Patient received 1 gm of IV Ancef preoperatively.  Arm was exsanguinated by means of elevation of Esmarch elastic tourniquet.  Tourniquet inflated to 250 mmHg pressure.  Hand positioned palm up in a lead hand-holder.  A longitudinal zigzag incision over the volar radial wrist mass was made.  Skin was sharply incised.  Careful blunt dissection was used in the subcutaneous tissue.  Antebrachial fascia was bluntly dissected and incised to reveal the radial artery.  Radial artery was mobilized preserving its dorsal and palmar branches.  Small transverse concomitant vein branches were divided to facilitate mobilization of the radial artery.  Wrist mass was exposed by blunt dissection.  This appeared to be an inflammatory arthritic mass from the volar radial wrist capsule.  This was debrided down to the wrist capsule with visualization of the joint through a small capsular window.  After complete volar synovectomy the capsular window was closed with 4-0 Mersilene figure-of-eight suture.  Subcutaneous tissue was closed with 4-0 PDS and the skin was closed with a running subcuticular 4-0 Prolene.  Forearm was pronated and C-arm image intensifier was used to confirm localization of the radial styloid for marking of the skin incision.  An oblique incision overlying the radial styloid centered on the second extensor compartment was made.  Skin was sharply incised.  Blunt dissection was used in the subcutaneous tissue.  Care was taken to identify and protect the superficial radial nerve.  Blunt dissection was carried out in the extensor retinaculum.  This was incised longitudinally over the second extensor compartment.  EPL tendon was identified, mobilized and released to facilitate retraction and prevent injury.  The interval between the ECRL and the ECRB was developed down to bone.  Dorsal capsulotomy was made and local synovitis was identified.  This was debrided and sent as second pathologic specimen.  Articular surface of the scaphoid was identified and seen to be completely devoid of articular cartilage with hard, eburnated subchondral bone consistent with a SLAC pattern arthritis.  Radial styloid had extensive spurring and was exposed subperiosteally and osteotomized in a dorsal oblique fashion preserving the volar cortex as the attachment point of the deep volar carpal ligament layer.  Dorsally the styloidectomy was beveled smooth and contoured with a rongeur.  Final x-rays documenting the styloidectomy were obtained.  Local synovitis beneath the joint capsule was debrided.  Remnants of the scapholunate interosseous which was completely deteriorated were debrided.  The joint capsule was closed anatomically with 4-0 PDS and extensor retinaculum was closed with 4-0 PDS.  Subcutaneous tissues closed with 4-0 Vicryl.  Skin was closed with running subcuticular 4-0 Prolene.  Steri-Strips were applied to wound edge closure; 10 cc of 0.5% plain Marcaine was infiltrated into the areas of the surgical incisions and radial styloidectomy for postoperative analgesia.  A bulky gently compressive wrist and forearm bandage incorporating an EBI cooling pad were applied.  Tourniquet was deflated.  Good vascular color and capillary refill were seen to return to the tips of all digits.

After induction of IV sedation the left hand was anesthetized suitable for carpal tunnel release; 10 cc of a mixture of 1% Xylocaine and 0.5% Marcaine was injected in the distal forearm and proximal palm suitable for carpal tunnel surgery.  Routine prep and drape was employed.  Arm was exsanguinated by means of elevation of Esmarch elastic tourniquet and tourniquet inflated to 250 mmHg pressure.  Hand was positioned palm up in the lead hand-holder.  A short curvilinear incision about the base of the thenar eminence was made.  Skin was sharply incised.  Sharp dissection was carried down to the transverse carpal ligament and this was carefully incised longitudinally along its ulnar margin.  Care was taken to divide the entire length of the transverse retinaculum including its distal insertion into deep palmar fascia in the midpalm.  Proximally the antebrachial fascia was released for a distance of 2-3 cm proximal to the wrist crease to insure complete decompression of the median nerve.  Retinacular flap was retracted radially to expose the contents of the carpal canal.  Median nerve was identified, seen to be locally compressed with moderate erythema and mild narrowing.  Locally adherent tenosynovium was present and this was carefully dissected free.  Additional tenosynovium was dissected from the flexor tendons, individually stripping and peeling each tendon in sequential order so as to debulk the contents of the carpal canal.  Epineurotomy and partial epineurectomy were carried out on the nerve in the area of mild constriction to relieve local external scarring of the epineurium.  When this was complete retinacular flap was laid loosely in place over the contents of the carpal canal and skin only was closed with interrupted 5-0 nylon horizontal mattress sutures.  A syringe with 3 cc of Kenalog-10 and 3 cc of 1% Xylocaine using a 25 gauge short needle was then selected; 1 cc of this mixture was injected into the third finger A1 and A2 pulley tendon sheaths using standard trigger finger injection technique; 1 cc was injected into the fourth finger A1/A2 pulley tendon sheath using standard tendon sheath injection technique; 1 cc was injected into the Dupuytren's nodule in the midpalm to relieve local discomfort.  Routine postoperative hand dressing with well-padded, well-molded volar plaster splint and lightly compressive Ace wrap was applied.  Tourniquet was deflated.  Good vascular color and capillary refill were seen to return to the tips of all digits.  Patient discharged to the ambulatory recovery area and from there discharged home.  Discharge medication is Darvocet-N 100, 30 tablets, one to two PO q.4h. p.r.n.

She requested that surgical procedures to be performed for correction of these abnormalities.  As such, complications were explained to the patient including infection, bleeding, poor wound healing, and need for additional surgery.  The patient subsequently signed the consent and requested that Dr. W and associates to perform the procedure.,TECHNIQUE,The patient was brought to the operating room in supine position.  General anesthesia was induced and then the patient was placed on the operating table in a prone position.  The posterior thigh of the right lower extremity was prepped and draped in a sterile fashion.  First, multiple serial small incisions less than 1 cm in length were made to the posterior aspect of the right thigh and sequential stripping of the varicose veins was performed.  Once these varicose veins had been completely stripped and avulsed, then next the wounds were then irrigated and were cleaned with wet and dry, and all the incisions were closed with the use of 5-0 Monocryl buried interrupted sutures.  The incisions were then dressed with Mastisol, Steri-Strips, ABDs and a TED hose.  Next, the patient was then flipped back over onto the stretcher and placed on the operating table in a supine position.  The anterior chest was then prepped and draped in a sterile fashion.  Next, a 10 blade was placed through previous circumareolar incisions from a previous augmentation mammoplasty.  Dissection was carried out with a 10 blade and Bovie cautery until the pectoralis fascia was identified to both breasts.  Once the pectoralis muscle and fascia were identified, then a surgical plane was created in a subglandular layer.  The hemostasis was obtained to both breast pockets with the Bovie cautery and suction and irrigation was performed to bilateral breast pockets as well.  A sizer was used to identify the appropriate size of the silicone implant to be used.  This was determined to be approximately 435 cc bilaterally.  As such, two mammary gel silicone breast implants were placed in a subglandular muscle.  Additional dissection of the breast pockets were performed bilaterally and the patient was sequentially placed in the upright sitting position for evaluation of appropriate placement of the mammary gel silicone implants.  Once it was determined that the implants were appropriately selected and placed with the 435 cc silicon gel implant, the circumareolar incisions were closed in approximately 4-layered fashion closing the fascia, subcutaneous tissue, deep dermis, and a running dermal subcuticular for final skin closure.  This was performed with 3-0 Monocryl and then 4-0 Monocryl for running subcuticular.  The incisions were then dressed with Mastisol, Steri-Strips, and Xeroform and dressed with sample Kerlix.  Next, our attention was paid to the face where 25% TCA solution was applied to two locations; one on the left cheek and the other one on the right cheek, where a hyperpigmentation/melasma.  Several applications of the TCA peel was performed, and at the end of this, the frosting was noted to both spots.  At the end of the case, needle and instrument counts were correct.

Demerol 50 mg.,2.  Phenergan 25 mg.,3.  Atropine 0.6 mg IM.,4.  Nebulized 4% lidocaine followed by nasal insufflation of lidocaine through the right naris and topical 4% lidocaine gel through the right naris, 4 mg of Versed was given at the start of the procedure and another 1 mg shortly after traversing the cords.,PROCEDURE DETAILS:,  With the patient breathing oxygen by nasal cannula, being monitored by noninvasive blood pressure cuff and continuous pulse oximetry, the Olympus bronchoscope was introduced through the right naris to the level of the cords.  The cords move normally with phonation and ventilation.  Two times 2 mL of 1% lidocaine were instilled on the cords and the cords were traversed.  Further 2 mL of 1% lidocaine was instilled in the trachea just distal to the cords, at mid trachea above the carina, and on the right, and on the left mainstem bronchus.  Scope was then introduced on to the left where immediately some hyperemia of the mucosa was noted.  Upper lobe and lingula were unremarkable.  There appeared to be some narrowing or tenting of the left lower lobe bronchus such that after inspection of the superior segment, one almost had to pop the bronchoscope around to go down the left mainstem.  This had been a change from the prior bronchoscopy of unclear significance.  Distal to this, there was no hyperemia or inspissated mucus or mucoid secretions or signs of infection.  The scope was wedged in the left lower lobe posterior basal segment and a BAL was done with good returns, which were faintly hemorrhagic.

Last surgery consisted of four-level decompression on 08/28/06.  The patient continued to complain of posterior neck pain radiating to both trapezius.  Review of his MRI revealed the presence of what still appeared to be residual lateral recess stenosis.  It also raised the possibility of instability and based on this I recommended decompression and posterolateral spinal instrumention; however, intraoperatively, it appeared like there was no abnormal movement of any of the joint segments; however, there was still residual stenosis since the laminectomy that was done previously was partial.  Based on this, I did total decompression by removing the lamina of C3 through C6 and doing bilateral medial facetectomy and foraminotomy at C3-C4, C4-C5, C5-C6, and C6-C7 with no spinal instrumentation.  Operation and expected outcome risks and benefits were discussed with him prior to the surgery.  Risks include but not exclusive of bleeding and infection.  Infection can be superficial, but may also extend down to the epidural space, which may require return to the operating room and evacuation of the infection.  There is also the risk of bleeding that could be superficial but may also be in the epidural space resulting in compression of spinal cord.  This may result in weakness of all four extremities, numbness of all four extremities, and impairment of bowel and bladder function, which will require an urgent return to the operating room and evacuation of the hematoma.  There is also the risk of a dural tear with its attendant problems of CSF leak, headache, nausea, vomiting, photophobia, pseudomeningocele, and dural meningitis.  This too may require return to the operating room for evacuation of said pseudomeningocele and repair.  The patient understood the risk of the surgery.  I told him there is just a 30% chance that there will be no improvement with the surgery; he understands this and agreed to have the procedure performed.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: , The patient was brought to the operating room, awake, alert, not in any form of distress.  After smooth induction and intubation, a Foley catheter was inserted.  Monitoring leads were also placed by Premier Neurodiagnostics for both SSEP and EMG monitoring.  The SSEPs were normal, and the EMGs were silent during the entire case.  After completion of the placement of the monitoring leads, the patient was then positioned prone on a Wilson frame with the head supported on a foam facial support.  Shave was then carried out over the occipital and suboccipital region.  All pressure points were padded.  I proceeded to mark the hypertrophic scar for excision.  This was initially cleaned with alcohol and prepped with DuraPrep.,After sterile drapes were laid out, incision was made using a scalpel blade #10.  Wound edge bleeders were carefully controlled with bipolar coagulation and a hot knife was utilized to excise the hypertrophic scar.  Dissection was then carried down to the cervical fascia, and by careful dissection to the scar tissue, the spinous process of C2 was then identified.  There was absence of the spinous process of C3, C4, C5, and C6, but partial laminectomy was noted; removal of only 15% of the lamina.  With this completed, we proceeded to do a total laminectomy at C3, C4, C5, and C6, which was technically difficult due to the previous surgery.  There was also a dural tear on the right C3-C4 space that was exposed and repaired with Prolene 6-0 and later with Tisseel.  By careful dissection and the use of a -5 and 3 mm bur, total laminectomy was done as stated with bilateral medial facetectomy and foraminotomy done at C3-C4, C4-C5, C5-C6, and C6-C7.  There was significant epidural bleeding, which was carefully coagulated.  At two points, I had to pack this with small pieces of Gelfoam.  After repair of the dural tear, Valsalva maneuver showed no evidence of any CSF leakage.  Area was irrigated with saline and bacitracin and then lined with Tisseel.  The wound was then closed in layers with Vicryl 0 simple interrupted sutures to the fascia; Vicryl 2-0 inverted interrupted sutures to the dermis and a running nylon 2-0 continuous vertical mattress stitch.  The patient was extubated and transferred to recovery.',\n",

I had a long discussion with him concerning variety of options.  We talked in particular about extirpated versus ablative surgery.  Based on his young age and excellent state of health, decision was made at this point to proceed to a right partial nephrectomy laparoscopically.  All questions were answered, and he wished to proceed with surgery as planned.  Note that the patient does have a positive family history of renal cell carcinoma.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , After acquisition of proper informed consent and administration of perioperative antibiotics, the patient was taken to the operating room and placed supine on the operating table.  After institution of adequate general anesthetic via endotracheal rod, he was placed into the right anterior flank position with his right side elevated on a roll and his right arm across his chest.  All pressure points were carefully padded, and he was securely taped to the table.  Note that sequential compression devices were in place on both lower extremities and were activated prior to induction of anesthesia.  His abdomen was then prepped and draped in a standard surgical fashion.  Note that a #16-French Foley catheter was in place per urethra as well as an orogastric tube.  The abdomen was insufflated at the right lateral abdomen using the Veress needle to a pressure of 15 without incident.  We then placed a Visiport 10 x 12 trocar in the right lateral abdomen.  With the trocar in place, we were able to place the remaining trocars under direct laparoscopic visualization.  We placed three additional trocars.  An 11 mm screw type trocar at the umbilicus, a 6 screw type trocar 7 cm in the midline above the umbilicus, and a 10 x 12 trocar to serve as a retractor port approximately 8 cm inferior in the midline.,The procedure was begun by reflecting the right colon by incising the white line of Toldt.  The colon was reflected medially, and the retroperitoneum was exposed on that side.  This was a fairly superficial lesion, so decision was made in advance to potentially not perform vascular clamping, however, I did feel it important to get high level control prior to proceeding to the partial.  With the colon reflected, the duodenum was identified, and it was reflected medially under Kocher maneuver.  The ureter and gonadal vein were identified on the right side and elevated.  The space between the ureter and the gonadal vein was then developed, and the gonadal vein was dropped elevating only the ureter, and carrying this plane dissection up towards the renal hilum.  Once we got up to the renal hilum, we were able to skeletonize the renal hilar vessels partially, and in particular, we did develop some of the upper pole dissection above the level of the hilum to provide for access for a Satinsky clamp or bulldogs.  The remainder of the kidney was then freed off its lateral and superior attachments primarily using the Harmonic scalpel and the LigaSure device.,With the kidney free and the hilum prepared, the Gerota fascia was taken down overlying the kidney exposing the renal parenchyma, and using this approach, we were able to identify the 2-cm, right renal mass located in the lower pole laterally.  A cap of fat was left overlying this mass.  Based on the position of the mass, we performed intraoperative laparoscopic ultrasound, which showed the mass to be somewhat deeper than initially anticipated.  Based on this finding, I decided to go ahead and clamp the renal hilum during resection.  A Satinsky clamp was introduced through the lower most trocar site and used to clamp the renal hilum en bloc.  Note that the patient had been receiving renal protection protocol including fenoldopam and mannitol throughout the procedure, and he also received Lasix prior to clamping the renal hilum.  With the renal hilum clamped, we did resect the tumor using cold scissors.  There was somewhat more bleeding than would be expected based on the hilar clamping; however, we were able to successfully resect this lesion.  We also took a biopsy at the base of the resection and passed off the table as a specimen for frozen section.  With the tumor resected, the base of the resection was then cauterized using the Argon beam coagulator, and several bleeding vessels were oversewn using figure-of-eight 3-0 Vicryl sutures with lap ties for tensioning.  We then placed a FloSeal into the wound and covered it with a Surgicel and held the pressure.  We then released the vascular clamp.  Total clamp time was 11 minutes.  There was minimal bleeding and occlusion of this maneuver, and after unclamping the kidney, the kidney pinked up appropriately and appeared well perfused after removal of the clamp.  We then replaced the kidney within its Gerota envelope and closed that with 3-0 Vicryl using lap ties for tensioning.  A JP drain was introduced through the right flank and placed adjacent to the kidney and sutured the skin with 2-0 nylon.  The specimen was placed into a 10-mm Endocatch bag and extracted from the lower most trocar site after extending it approximately 1 cm.  It was evaluated on the table and passed off the table for Pathology to evaluate.  They stated that the tumor was close to the margin, but there appeared to be 1-2 mm normal parenchyma around the tumor.  In addition, the frozen section biopsies from the base of the resection were negative for renal cell carcinoma.  Based on these findings, the lower most trocar site was closed using a running 0 Vicryl suture in the fascia.  We then re-insufflated the abdomen and carefully evaluated the entire intraoperative field for hemostasis.  Any bleeding points were controlled primarily using bipolar cautery or hemoclips.  The area was copiously irrigated with normal saline.  The colon was then replaced into its normal anatomic position.  The mesentry was evaluated.  There were no defects noted.  We closed the 10 x 12 lateral most trocar site using a Carter-Thompson closure device with 0-Vicryl.  All trocars were removed under direct visualization, and the abdomen was desufflated prior to removal of the last trocar.  The skin incisions were irrigated with normal saline and infiltrated with 0.25% Marcaine, and the skin was closed using a running 4-0 Monocryl in subcuticular fashion.  Benzoin and Steri-Strips were placed.  The patient was returned in supine position and awoken from general anesthetic without incident.  He was then transferred to hospital gurney and taken to the postanesthesia care unit for postoperative monitoring.  At the end of the case, sponge, instrument, and needle counts were correct.  I was scrubbed and present throughout the entire case.',\n",

Lymph node package, additional level 8 lymph node.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:,  Less than 100 mL.,CONDITION OF THE PATIENT AFTER SURGERY: , Stable.,HISTORY OF PROCEDURE: , The patient was given preoperative informed consent for the procedure as well as for the clinical trial he was enrolled into.  The patient agreed based on the risks and the benefits of the procedure, which were presented to him and was taken to the operating room.  A correct time out procedure was performed.  The patient was placed into the supine position.  He was given general anesthesia, was endotracheally intubated without incident with a double-lumen endotracheal tube.  Fiberoptic bronchoscopy was used to perform confirmation of adequate placement of the double-lumen tube.  Following this, the decision was made to proceed with the surgery.  The patient was rolled into the right lateral decubitus position with the left side up.  All pressure points were padded.  The patient had a sterile DuraPrep preparation to the left chest.  A sterile drape around that was applied.  Also, the patient had Marcaine infused into the incision area.  Following this, the patient had a posterolateral thoracotomy incision, which was a muscle-sparing incision with a posterior approach just over the ausculatory triangle.  The incision was approximately 10 cm in size.  This was created with a 10-blade scalpel.  Bovie electrocautery was used to dissect the subcutaneous tissues.  The auscultatory triangle was opened.  The posterior aspect of the latissimus muscle was divided from the adjacent tissue and retracted anteriorly.  The muscle was not divided.  After the latissimus muscle was retracted anteriorly, the ribs were counted, and the sixth rib was identified.  The superior surface of the sixth rib was incised with Bovie electrocautery and the sixth rib was divided with rib shears.  Following this, the patient had the entire intercostal muscle separated from the superior aspect of the sixth rib on the left as far as the Bovie would reach.  The left lung was allowed to collapse and meticulous inspection of the left lung identified the lesions, which were taken out with stapled wedge resections via a TA30 green load stapler for all of the wedges.  The patient tolerated the procedure well without any complications.  The largest lesion was the left upper lobe apex lesion, which was possibly multiple lesions, which was taken in one large wedge segment, and this was also adjacent to another area of the wedges.  The patient had multiple pleural abnormalities, which were identified on the surface of the lung.  These were small white spotty looking lesions and were not confirmed to be tumor implants, but were suspicious to be multiple areas of tumor.  Based on this, the wedges of the tumors that were easily palpable were excised with complete excision of all palpable lesions.  Following this, the patient had a 32-French chest tube placed in the anteroapical position.  A 19-French Blake was placed in the posterior apical position.  The patient had the intercostal space reapproximated with #2-0 Vicryl suture, and the lung was allowed to be re-expanded under direct visualization.  Following this, the chest tubes were placed to Pleur-evac suction and the auscultatory triangle was closed with 2-0 Vicryl sutures.  The deeper tissue was closed with 3-0 Vicryl suture, and the skin was closed with running 4-0 Monocryl suture in a subcuticular fashion.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and had no complications.',\n",

Since then, the patient started complaining of acute right arm and right leg weakness, which had been progressively worsening.  About two days ago, he started noticing weakness on the left arm.  The patient also noted shuffling gait.  The patient presented to a family physician and was referred to Dr. X for further evaluation.  Dr. X could not attempt to this, so he called me at the office and the patient was sent to the emergency room, where an MRI of the brain was essentially unremarkable as well as MRI of the thoracic spine.  MRI of the cervical spine, however, revealed an acute disk herniation at C3-C4 with evidence of stenosis and cord changes.  Based on these findings, I recommended decompression.  The patient was started on Decadron at 10 mg IV q.6h.  Operation, expected outcome, risks, and benefits were discussed with him.  Risks to include but not exclusive of bleeding and infection.  Bleeding can be superficial, but can compromise airway, for which he has been told that he may be brought emergently back to the operating room for evacuation of said hematoma.  The hematoma could also be an epidural hematoma, which may compress the spinal cord and result in weakness of all four extremities, numbness of all four extremities, and impairment of bowel and bladder function.  Should this happen, he needs to be brought emergently back to the operating room for evacuation of said hematoma.  There is also the risk by removing the hematoma that he can deteriorate as far as neurological condition, but this hopefully with the steroid prep will be prevented or if present will only be transient.  There is also the possibility of infection, which can be superficial and treated with IV and p.o. antibiotics.  However, should the infection be extensive or be deep, he may require return to the operating room for debridement and irrigation.  This may pose a medical problem since in the presence of infection, the graft as well as spinal instrumentation may have to be removed.  There is also the possibility of dural tear with its attendant complaints of headache, nausea, vomiting, photophobia, as well as the development of pseudomeningocele.  This too can compromise airway and may require return to the operating room for repair of the dural tear.  There is also potential risk of injury to the esophagus, the trachea, as well as the carotid.  The patient can also have a stroke on the right cerebral circulation should the plaque be propelled into the right circulation.  The patient understood all these risks together with the risk associated with anesthesia and agreed to have the procedure performed.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was brought to the operating room, awake, alert and not in any form of distress.  After smooth induction and intubation, a Foley catheter was inserted.  No monitoring leads were placed.  The patient was then positioned supine on the operating table with the head supported on a foam doughnut and the neck placed on hyperextension with a shoulder roll under both shoulders.  Localizing x-ray verified the marker to be right at the C3-4 interspace.  Proceeded to mark an incision along the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid with the central point at the area of the marker measuring about 3 cm in length.  The area was then prepped with DuraPrep.,After sterile drapes were laid out, an incision was made using a scalpel blade #10.  Wound edge bleeders were controlled with bipolar coagulation and a hot knife was utilized to cut the platysma in a similar fashion.  The anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid was identified and dissection was carried superior to and lateral to the esophagus and trachea, but medial to the carotid sheath.  The prevertebral fascia was identified.  Localizing x-ray verified another marker to be at the C3-4 interspace.  Proceeded to strip the longus colli muscles off the vertebral body of C3 and C4 and a self-retaining retractor was then laid out.  There was some degree of anterior osteophyte and this was carefully drilled down with a Midas 5-mm bur.  The disk was then cut through the annulus and removal of the disk was done with the use of the Midas 5-mm bur and later a 3-mm bur.  The inferior endplate of C3 and the superior endplate of C4 were likewise drilled out together with posterior inferior osteophyte at the C3 and the posterior superior osteophyte at C4.  There was note of a central disk herniation centrally, but more marked displacement of the cord on the left side.  By careful dissection of this disk, posterior longitudinal ligament was removed and pressure on the cord was removed.  Hemostasis of the epidural bleeders was done with a combination of bipolar coagulation, but we needed to put a small piece of Gelfoam on the patient's left because of profuse venous bleeder.  With this completed, the Valsalva maneuver showed no evidence of any CSF leakage.  A 7-mm implant with its interior packed with Vitoss was then tapped into place.  An 18-mm plate was then screwed down with four 14 x 4.0 mm screws.  The area was irrigated with saline, with bacitracin solution.  Postoperative x-ray showed excellent placement of the graft and spinal instrumentation.  A round French 10 JP drain was laid over the construct and exteriorized though a separate stab incision on the patient's right inferiorly.  The wound was then closed in layers with Vicryl 3-0 inverted interrupted sutures for the platysma, Vicryl 4-0 subcuticular stitch for the dermis and Dermabond.  The catheter was anchored to the skin with a nylon 3-0 stitch.  Dressing was placed only on the exit site of the drain.  C-collar was placed, and the patient was transferred to the recovery awake and moving all four extremities.\",\n",
       " 'OPERATION: , Left lower lobectomy.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , The patient was brought to the operating room and placed in the supine position.  After general endotracheal anesthesia was induced, the appropriate monitoring devices were placed.  The patient was placed in the right lateral decubitus position.  The left chest and back were prepped and draped in a sterile fashion.  A right lateral thoracotomy incision was made.  Subcutaneous flaps were raised.  The anterior border of the latissimus dorsi was freed up, and the muscle was retracted posteriorly.  The posterior border of the pectoralis was freed up and it was retracted anteriorly.  The 5th intercostal space was entered.,The inferior pulmonary ligament was then taken down with electrocautery.  The major fissure was then taken down and arteries identified.  The artery was dissected free and it was divided with an Endo GIA stapler.  The vein was then dissected free and divided with an Endo GIA stapler.  The bronchus was then cleaned of all nodal tissue.  A TA-30 green loaded stapler was then placed across this, fired, and main bronchus divided distal to the stapler.,Then the lobe was removed and sent to pathology where margins were found to be free of tumor.  Level 9, level 13, level 11, and level 6 nodes were taken for permanent cell specimen.  Hemostasis noted.  Posterior 28-French and anterior 24-French chest tubes were placed.,The wounds were closed with #2 Vicryl.  A subcutaneous drain was placed.  Subcutaneous tissue was closed with running 3-0 Dexon, skin with running 4-0 Dexon subcuticular stitch.',\n",

She has now been put forward for operative intervention.,PREOP DIAGNOSIS:  ,1.  Patent ductus arteriosus.,2.  Severe prematurity.,3.  Operative weight less than 4 kg (600 grams).,COMPLICATIONS: , None.,FINDINGS: , Large patent ductus arteriosus with evidence of pulmonary over circulation.  After completion of the procedure, left recurrent laryngeal nerve visualized and preserved.  Substantial rise in diastolic blood pressure.,DETAILS OF THE PROCEDURE: , After obtaining information consent, the patient was positioned in the neonatal intensive care unit, cribbed in the right lateral decubitus, and general endotracheal anesthesia was induced.  The left chest was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion and a posterolateral thoracotomy incision was performed.  Dissection was carried through the deeper planes until the second intercostal space was entered freely with no damage to the underlying lung parenchyma.  The lung was quite edematous and was retracted anteriorly exposing the area of the isthmus.  The pleura overlying the ductus arteriosus was inside and the duct dissected in a nearly circumferential fashion.  It was then test occluded and then interrupted with a medium titanium clip.  There was preserved pulsatile flow in the descending aorta.  The left recurrent laryngeal nerve was identified and preserved.  With excellent hemostasis, the intercostal space was closed with 4-0 Vicryl sutures and the muscular planes were reapproximated with 5-0 Caprosyn running suture in two layers.  The skin was closed with a running 6-0 Caprosyn suture.  A sterile dressing was placed.  Sponge and needle counts were correct times 2 at the end of the procedure.  The patient was returned to the supine position in which palpable bilateral femoral pulses were noted.,I was the surgical attending present in the neonatal intensive care unit and in-charge of the surgical procedure throughout the entire length of the case.',\n",
       " 'SUBJECTIVE:,  This is a 2-year-old female who comes in for just rechecking her weight, her breathing status, and her diet.  The patient is in foster care, has a long history of the prematurity, born at 22 weeks.  She has chronic lung disease, is on ventilator, but doing sprints, has been doing very well, is up to 4-1/2 hours sprints twice daily and may go up 15 minutes every three days or so; which she has been tolerating fairly well as long as they kind of get her distracted towards the end, otherwise, she does get sort of tachypneic.  She is on 2-1/2 liters of oxygen and does require that.  Her diet has been fluctuating.  They have been trying to figure out what works best with her.  She has been on some Pediasure for the increased calories but that really makes her distended in the abdomen and constipates her.  They have been doing more pureed foods and that seems to loosen her up, so they have been doing more Isomil 24 cal and baby foods and not so much Pediasure.  She was hospitalized a couple of weeks back for the distension she had in the abdomen.  Dr. XYZ has been working with her G-tube, increasing her Mic-key button size, but also doing some silver nitrate applications, and he is going to evaluate her again next week, but they are happy with the way her G-tube site is looking.  She also has been seen Dr. Eisenbaum, just got of new pair of glasses this week and sees him in another couple of weeks for reevaluation.,CURRENT MEDICATIONS:,  Flagyl, vitamins, Zyrtec, albuterol, and some Colace.,ALLERGIES TO MEDICINES: , None.,FAMILY SOCIAL HISTORY:,  As mentioned, she is in foster care.  Foster mom is actually going to be out of town for a week the 19th through the 23rd, so she will probably be hospitalized in respite care because there are no other foster care situations that can handle the patient.  Biological Mom and Grandma do visit on Thursdays for about an hour.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:,  The patient has been eating fairly well, sleeping well, doing well with her sprints.  A little difficulty with her stools hard versus soft as mentioned with the diet situation up in HPI.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,Vital Signs:  She is 28 pounds 8 ounces today, 33-1/2 inches tall.  She is on 2-1/2 liters, but she is not the vent currently, she is doing her sprints, and her respiratory rate is around 40.,HEENT:  Sclerae and conjunctivae are clear.  TMs are clear.  Nares are patent.  Oropharynx is clear.  Trach site is clear of any signs of infection.,Chest:  Coarse.  She has got little bit of wheezing going on, but she is moving air fairly well.,Abdomen:  Positive bowel sounds and soft.  The G-tube site looks fairly clean today and healthy.  No signs of infection.  Her tone is good.  Capillary refill is less than three seconds.,ASSESSMENT:,  A 2-year-old with chronic lung disease, doing the sprints, some bowel difficulties, also just weight gain issues because of the high-energy expenditure with the sprints that she is doing.,PLAN:,  At this point is to continue with the Isomil and pureed baby foods, a little bit of Pediasure.  They are going to see Dr. XYZ towards the end of this month and follow up with Dr. Eisenbaum.  I would like to see her in approximately six weeks again, but we do need to keep a close check on her weight and call if there are problems beforehand.  She is just doing wonderful progression on her development.  Each time I see her, I am very impressed, that relayed to foster mom.  Approximately 25 minutes spent with the patient, most of it counseling.',\n",
       " \"HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , Goes back to yesterday, the patient went out for dinner with her boyfriend.  The patient after coming home all the family members had some episodes of diarrhea; it is unclear how many times the patient had diarrhea last night.  She was found down on the floor this morning, soiled her bowel movements.  Paramedics were called and the patient was brought to the emergency room.  The patient was in the emergency room noted to be in respiratory failure, was intubated.  The patient was in septic shock with metabolic acidosis and no blood pressure and very rapid heart rate with acute renal failure.  The patient was started on vasopressors.  The patient was started on IV fluids as well as IV antibiotic.  The CT of the abdomen showed ileus versus bowel distention without any actual bowel obstruction or perforation.  A General Surgery consultation was called who did not think the patient was a surgical candidate and needed an acute surgical procedure.  The patient underwent an ultrasound of the abdomen, which did not show any evidence of cholecystitis or cholelithiasis.  The patient was also noted to have acute rhabdomyolysis on the workup in the emergency room.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  ,Significant for history of osteoporosis, hypertension, tobacco dependency, anxiety, neurosis, depression, peripheral arterial disease, peripheral neuropathy, and history of uterine cancer.,PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  ,Significant for hysterectomy, bilateral femoropopliteal bypass surgeries as well as left eye cataract surgery and appendicectomy.,SOCIAL HISTORY: , She lives with her boyfriend.

Advancement flap closure, with total undermined area 18 centimeters by 16 centimeters (CPT 14300).,ANESTHESIA:,  General endotracheal anesthesia.,INDICATIONS:  ,This is an 81-year-old male who has a large exophytic 7cm lesion of the anterior midline scalp which is biopsy-positive for skin malignancy, specifically, squamous call carcinoma.  This appears to be affixed to the underlying scalp.,PLAN: , Radical resection with frozen sections to clear margins thereafter, with planned reconstruction.,CONSENT:,  I have discussed with the patient the possible risks of bleeding, infection, renal problems, scar formation, injury to muscle, nerves, and possible need for additional surgery with possible recurrence of the patient's carcinoma, with review of detailed informed consent with the patient, who understood, and wished to proceed.,FINDINGS: , The patient had a 7cm large exophytic lesion which appeared to be invasive into the superficial table of the skull.  The final periosteal margin which centrally appeared was positive for carcinoma.  The final margins peripherally were all negative.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , The patient was taken to the operating room and there was placed supine on the operating room table.,General endotracheal anesthesia was administered after endotracheal tube intubation was performed by the Anesthesia Service personnel.  The patient was thereafter prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner using Betadine Scrub and Betadine paint.  Thereafter, the local anesthesia was injected into the area around the tumor.  A **** type excision was planned down to the periosteum.  A supraperiosteal radical resection was performed.,It was obvious that there was tumor at the deep margin, involving the periosteum.  The edges were marked along the four quadrants, at the 12 o'clock, 3 o'clock, 6 o'clock, and the 9 o'clock positions, and these were sent for frozen section evaluation.  Frozen section revealed positive margins at one end of the resection.  Therefore, an additional circumferential resection was performed and the final margins were all negative.,Following completion, the deep periosteal margin was resected.  The circumferential periosteal margins were noted to be negative; however, centrally, there was a small area which showed tumor eroding into the superficial cortex of the skull.  Therefore, the Midas Rex drill was utilized to resect approximately 1-2 mm of the superficial cortex of the bone at the area where the positive margin was located.  Healthy bone was obtained; however, it did not enter the diploic or marrow-containing bone in the area.  Therefore, no bong margin was taken.  However, at the end of the procedure, it did not appear that the residual bone had any residual changes consistent with carcinoma.,Following completion of the bony resection, the area was irrigated with copious amounts of saline.  Thereafter, advancement flaps were created, both on the left and the right side of the scalp, with the total undermined area being approximately 18cm by 16cm.  The galea was incised in multiple areas, to provide for additional mobilization of the tissue.  The tissue was closed under tension with 3-0 Vicryl suture deep in the galea and surgical staples superficially.,The patient was awakened from anesthetic, was extubated and was taken to the recovery room in stable condition.,DISPOSITION:,  The patient was discharged to home with antibiotics and analgesics, to follow-up in approximately one week.,NOTE: , The final margins of both periosteal, as well as skin were negative circumferentially, around the tumor.  The only positive margin was deep, which was a periosteal margin and bone underlying it was partially resected, as was indicated above.\",\n",

The left neck and chest were prepped and draped in the usual manner and the skin and subcutaneous tissues below the left clavicle were infiltrated with 1% lidocaine for local anesthesia. A 2-1/2-inch incision was made below the left clavicle and electrocautery was used for hemostasis. Dissection was carried out to the level of the pectoralis fascia and extended caudally to create a pocket for the pulse generator. The deltopectoral groove was explored and a medium-sized cephalic vein was identified. The distal end of the vein was ligated and a venotomy was performed. Two guide wires were advanced to the superior vena cava and peel-away introducer sheaths were used to insert the two pacing leads. The venous pressures were elevated and there was a fair amount of back-bleeding from the vein, so a 3-0 Monocryl figure-of-eight stitch was placed around the tissue surrounding the vein for hemostasis. The right ventricular lead was placed in the high RV septum and the right atrial lead was placed in the right atrial appendage. The leads were tested with a pacing systems analyzer and the results are noted above. The leads were then anchored in place with #0-silk around their suture sleeve and connected to the pulse generator. The pacemaker was noted to function appropriately. The pocket was then irrigated with antibiotic solution and the pacemaker system was placed in the pocket. The incision was closed with two layers of 3-0 Monocryl and a subcuticular closure of 4-0 Monocryl. The incision was dressed with Steri-Strips and a sterile bandage and the patient was returned to her room in good condition.,IMPRESSION: ,Successful implantation of a dual chamber permanent pacemaker via the left cephalic vein.

He now has evidence of lesion in the left mid neck and the left superior neck on ultrasound, which are suspicious for recurrent cancer.  Left neck dissection is indicated.,DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION: , The patient was placed on the operating room table in the supine position.  After adequate general endotracheal anesthesia was administered, the table was then turned.  A shoulder roll placed under the shoulders and the face was placed in an extended fashion.  The left neck, chest, and face were prepped with Betadine and draped in a sterile fashion.  A hockey stick skin incision was performed, extending a previous incision line superiorly towards the mastoid cortex through skin, subcutaneous tissue and platysma with Bovie electrocautery on cut mode.  Subplatysmal superior and inferior flaps were raised.  The dissection was left lateral neck dissection encompassing zones 1, 2A, 2B, 3, and the superior portion of 4.  The sternocleidomastoid muscle was unwrapped at its fascial attachment and this was taken back posterior to the XI cranial nerve into the superior posterior most triangle of the neck.  This was carried forward off of the deep rooted muscles including the splenius capitis and anterior and middle scalenes taken medially off of these muscles including the fascia of the muscles, stripped from the carotid artery, the X cranial nerve, the internal jugular vein and then carried anteriorly to the lateral most extent of the dissection previously done by Dr. X in the paratracheal region.  The submandibular gland was removed as well.  The X, XI, and XII cranial nerves were preserved.  The internal jugular vein and carotid artery were preserved as well.  Copious irrigation of the wound bed showed no identifiable bleeding at the termination of the procedure.  There were two obviously positive nodes in this neck dissection.  One was left medial neck just lateral to the previous tracheal dissection and one was in the mid region of zone 2.  A #10 flat fluted Blake drain was placed through a separate stab incision and it was secured to the skin with a 2-0 silk ligature.  The wound was closed in layers using a 3-0 Vicryl in a buried knot interrupted fashion for the subcutaneous tissue and the skin was closed with staples.  A fluff and Kling pressure dressing was then applied.  The patient was extubated in the operating room, brought to the recovery room in satisfactory condition.  There were no intraoperative complications.',\n",
       " 'HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , This is a 76-year-old female that was admitted with fever, chills, and left pelvic pain.  The patient was well visiting in ABC, with her daughter that evening.  She had pain in her left posterior pelvic and low back region.  They came back to XYZ the following day.  By the time they got here, she was in severe pain and had fever.  They came straight to the emergency room.  She was admitted.  She had temperature of 104 degrees F.  It has been spiking ever since and she has had left sacroiliac type hip pain.  Multiple blood studies have been done including cultures, febrile agglutinins, etc.  She has had run a higher blood glucose to the normal and she has been on sliding scale insulin.  She was not known previously to be a diabetic.  All x-rays have not been helpful as far as to determine the etiology of her discomfort.  MRIs of the lumbar spine and the pelvis and both thighs have been unremarkable for any inflammatory process.  She does have degenerative disk disease of her lumbar spine but no hip pathology.  She has swollen inguinal nodes bilaterally.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY AND REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: , She was not known to be a diabetic until this admission.  She had been hypertensive.  She has been on medications and has been controlled.  She has not had hyperlipidemia.  She has had no thyroid problems.  There has been no asthma, bronchitis, TB, emphysema or pneumonia.  No tuberculosis.  She has had no breast tumors.  She has had no chest pain or cardiac problems.  She has had gallbladder surgery.  She has not had any gastritis or ulcers.  She has had no kidney disease.  She has had a hysterectomy.  She has had 9 pregnancies and 8 living children.  She had A&P repair.  She had a sacral abscess after a spinal.  It sounds to me like she had a pilonidal cyst, which took about 3 operations to heal.  There have been fractures and no significant arthritis.  She has been quite active at her ranch in Mexico.  She raises goats and cattle.  She drives a tractor and in short, has been very active.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,  She is a short female, alert.  She is shivering.  She has ice in her axilla and behind her neck.  She is febrile to 101 degrees F. She is alert.  Her complaint is that of hip pain in the posterior sacroiliac joint area.  She moves both her upper extremities well.  She can move her right leg well.  She actually can move her left hip and knee without much discomfort but the pain radiates from her sacroiliac joint.  She cannot stand, sit or turn without severe pain.  She has normal knee reflexes.  No ankle reflexes.  She has bounding tibial pulses.  No sensory deficit.  She says she knows when she has to void.  She has a healed scar in the upper sacral region.  There is some bruising around the buttocks but the daughter says that is from her being in bed lying on her back.,PLAN: , My plan is to do a triple-phase bone scan.  I am suspecting an infection possibly in the left sacroiliac joint.  It is probably some type of bacterium, the etiology of which is undetermined.  She has had a normal white count despite her fever.  There has been a history of brucellosis in the past, but her titers at this time are negative.  Continue medication which included antibiotics and also the Motrin and Darvocet.,',\n",

General inhalational anesthesia was administered through the patient's existing 4.0 endotracheal tube.  The neck was extended and secured with tape and incision in the midline of the neck approximately 2 fingerbreadths above the sternal notch was outlined.  The incision measured approximately 1 cm and was just below the palpable cricoid cartilage and first tracheal ring.  The incision area was infiltrated with 1% Xylocaine with epinephrine 1:100,000.  A #67 blade was used to perform the incision.  Electrocautery was used to remove excess fat tissue to expose the strap muscles.  The strap muscles were grasped and divided in the midline with a cutting electrocautery.  Sharp dissection was used to expose the anterior trachea and cricoid cartilage.  The thyroid isthmus was identified crossing just below the cricoid cartilage.  This was divided in the midline with electrocautery.  Blunt dissection was used to expose adequate cartilaginous rings.  A 4.0 silk was used for stay sutures to the midline of the cricoid.  Additional stay sutures were placed on each side of the third tracheal ring.  Thin DuoDerm was placed around the stoma.  The tracheal incision was performed with a #11 blade through the second, third, and fourth tracheal rings.  The cartilaginous edges were secured to the skin edges with interrupted #4-0 Monocryl.  A 4.5 PED tight-to-shaft cuffed Bivona tube was placed and secured with Velcro ties.  A flexible scope was passed through the tracheotomy tube.  The carina was visualized approximately 1.5 cm distal to the distal end of the tracheotomy tube.  Ventilation was confirmed.  There was good chest rise and no appreciable leak.  The procedure was terminated.  The patient was in stable condition.  Bleeding was negligible and she was transferred back to the Pediatric intensive care unit in stable condition.\",\n",

She is blood type AB -ve with antibody screen negative and is also rubella immune, VDRL nonreactive, hepatitis B surface antigen negative, and HIV nonreactive.  She does have a history of sickle cell trait.  She presented to Labor and Delivery Triage at 40 and 3/7th weeks gestation with complaint of contractions every ten minutes.  She also stated that she has lost her mucous plug.  She did have fetal movement, noted no leak of fluid, did have some spotting.  On evaluation of triage, she was noted to be contracting approximately every five minutes and did have discomfort with her contractions.  She was evaluated by sterile vaginal exam and was noted to be 4 cm dilated, 70% effaced, and -3 station.  This was a change from her last office exam, at which she was 1 cm to 2 cm dilated.,PROCEDURE DETAILS:,  The patient was admitted to Labor and Delivery for expected management of labor and AROM was performed and the amniotic fluid was noted to be meconium stained.  After her membranes were ruptured, contractions did increase to every two to three minutes as well as the intensity increased.  She was given Nubain for discomfort with good result.,She had a spontaneous vaginal delivery of a live born female at 11:37 with meconium stained fluid as noted from ROA position.  After controlled delivery of the head, tight nuchal cord was noted, which was quickly double clamped and cut and the shoulders and body were delivered without difficulty.  The infant was taken to the awaiting pediatrician.  Weight was 2870 gm, length was 51 cm.  The Apgars were 6 at 1 minute and 9 at 5 minutes.  There was initial neonatal depression, which was treated by positive pressure ventilation and the administration of Narcan.,Spontaneous delivery of an intact placenta with a three-vessel cord was noted at 11:45.  On examination, there were no noted perineal abrasions or lacerations.  On vaginal exam, there were no noted cervical or vaginal sidewall lacerations.  Estimated blood loss was less than 250 cc.

       " 'A 1 cm infraumbilical skin incision was made.  Through this a Veress needle was inserted into the abdominal cavity.  The abdomen was filled with approximately 2 liters of CO2 gas.  The Veress needle was withdrawn.  A trocar sleeve was placed through the incision into the abdominal cavity.  The trocar was withdrawn and replaced with the laparoscope.  A 1 cm suprapubic skin incision was made.  Through this a second trocar sleeve was placed into the abdominal cavity using direct observation with the laparoscope.  The trocar was withdrawn and replaced with a probe.,The patient was placed in Trendelenburg position, and the bowel was pushed out of the pelvis.  Upon visualization of the pelvis organs, the uterus, fallopian tubes and ovaries were all normal.  The probe was withdrawn and replaced with the bipolar cautery instrument.  The right fallopian tube was grasped approximately 1 cm distal to the cornual region of the uterus.  Electrical current was applied to the tube at this point and fulgurated.  The tube was then regrasped just distal to this and refulgurated.  It was then regrasped just distal to the lateral point and refulgurated again.  The same procedure was then carried out on the opposite tube.  The bipolar cautery instrument was withdrawn and replaced with the probe.  The fallopian tubes were again traced to their fimbriated ends to confirm the burn points on the tubes.  The upper abdomen was visualized, and the liver surface was normal.  The gas was allowed to escape from the abdomen, and the instruments were removed.  The skin incisions were repaired.  The instruments were removed from the vagina.,There were no complications to the procedure.  Blood loss was minimal.  The patient went to the postanesthesia recovery room in stable condition.',\n",

Rheumatoid arthritis.,4.  Suspected mild stress-induced adrenal insufficiency.,HOSPITAL COURSE: , This very independent 79-year old had struggled with cough, fevers, weakness, and chills for the week prior to admission.  She was seen on multiple occasions at Urgent Care and in her physician's office.  Initial x-ray showed some mild diffuse patchy infiltrates.  She was first started on Avelox, but had a reaction, switched to Augmentin, which caused loose stools, and then three days prior to admission was given daily 1 g Rocephin and started on azithromycin.  Her O2 saturations drifted downward.  They were less than 88% when active; at rest, varied between 88% and 92%.  Decision was made because of failed outpatient treatment of pneumonia.  Her medical history is significant for rheumatoid arthritis.  She is on 20 mg of methotrexate every week as well as Remicade every eight weeks.  Her last dose of Remicade was in the month of June.  Hospital course was relatively unremarkable.  CT scan was performed and no specific focal pathology was seen.  Dr. X, pulmonologist was consulted.  He also was uncertain as to the exact etiology, but viral etiology was most highly suspected.  Because of her loose stools, C. difficile toxin was ordered, although that is pending at the time of discharge.  She was continued on Rocephin IV and azithromycin.  Her fever broke 18 hours prior to discharge, and O2 saturations improved, as did her overall strength and clinical status.  She was instructed to finish azithromycin.  She has two pills left at home.  She is to follow up with Dr. X in two to three days.  Because she is on chronic prednisone therapy, it was suspected that she was mildly adrenal insufficient from the stress of her pneumonia.  She is to continue the increased dose of prednisone at 20 mg (up from 5 mg per day).  We will consult her rheumatologist as to whether to continue her methotrexate, which we held this past Friday.  Methotrexate is known on some occasions to cause pneumonitis.\",\n",

She has a history of bipolar disorder and has been diagnosed at times with schizophrenia.  She is on Depakote 500 mg three times a day and Geodon 80 mg twice a day.  The patient receives mental health care through the XYZ Health System and there is a psychiatrist who makes rounds at the ABC Hotel.  She denies hallucinations, psychosis, paranoia, and suicidal ideation at this time.  States that she does not want surgery because the chest pain that was a presenting complaint has gone away that she did not feel her problem is severe enough to require surgery, and medical records does show in this obese individual that cardiac surgery would present substantial risks and for this individual with the chronic mental illness and behavioral problems of a chronic nature, surgery does present some additional risks.  The patient notes that she has a long history of substance abuse, primarily inhalation of paint vapors that she had more than 100 incarcerations in the XYZ County Jail related to offenses related to her lifestyle at that time such as shoplifting, violation of orders to abstain from substance abuse and the longest confinement of these was 100 days.,The patient is able to write a fairly reasonable explanation for why she does not want to pursue medical care.,PAST AND DEVELOPMENTAL HISTORY: , She was born in XYZ.

It was unclear from her previous operative records and CT scan as to whether or not she was a reconstruction candidate.  She had reports of stapes fixation as well as otosclerosis on her CT scan.,At surgery, she was found to have a mobile malleus handle, but her stapes was fixed by otosclerosis.  There was no incus.  There was no specific round window niche.  There was a very minute crevice; however, exploration of this area did not reveal a niche to a round window membrane.  The patient had a type of TORP prosthesis, which had tilted off the footplate anteriorly underneath the malleus handle.,DESCRIPTION OF THE PROCEDURE:,  The patient was brought to the operative room and placed in supine position.  The right face, ear, and neck prepped with ***** alcohol solution.  The right ear was draped in the sterile field.  External auditory canal was injected with 1% Xylocaine with 1:50,000 epinephrine.  A Fisch indwelling incision was made and a tympanomeatal flap was developed in a 12 o'clock to the 7 o'clock position.  Meatal skin was elevated, middle ear was entered.  This exposure included the oval window, round window areas.  There was a good cartilage graft in place and incorporated into the posterior superior ***** of the drum.  The previous prosthesis was found out of position as it had tilted out of position anteriorly, and there was no contact with the footplate.  The prosthesis was removed without difficulty.  The patient's stapes had an arch, but the ***** was atrophied.  Malleus handle was mobile.  The footplate was fixed.  Consideration have been given to performing a stapedectomy with a tissue seal and then returning later for prosthesis insertion; however, upon inspection of the round window area, there was found to be no definable round window niche, no round window membrane.  The patient was felt to have obliterated otosclerosis of this area along with the stapes fixation.  She is not considered to be a reconstruction candidate under the current circumstances.  No attempt was made to remove bone from the round window area.  A different style of Goldenberg TORP was placed on the footplate underneath the cartilage support in hopes of transferring some sound conduction from the tympanic membrane to the footplate.  The fit was secure and supported with Gelfoam in the middle ear.  The tympanomeatal flap was returned to anatomic position supported with Gelfoam saturated Ciprodex.

An #8 French sheath was advanced over the guidewire into the femoral vein after which the dilator and guidewire were removed and the sheath was flushed.  A Swan-Ganz catheter was advanced through the venous sheath into a pulmonary capillary was positioned and the balloon was temporarily deflated.  An angulated pigtail catheter was advanced into the left ventricle under direct fluoroscopic visualization with the use of a guidewire.  The guidewire was removed.  The catheter was connected to a manifold and flushed.  Left ventricular pressures were continuously measured and the balloon was re-inflated and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure was remeasured.  Using dual transducers together and the mitral valve radius was estimated.  The balloon was deflated and mixed venous sample was obtained.  Hemodynamics were measured.  The catheter was pulled back in to the pulmonary artery right ventricle and right atrium.  The right atrial sample was obtained and was negative for shunt.  The Swan-Ganz catheter was then removed and a left ventriculogram was performed in the RAO projection with a single power injection of non-ionic contrast material.  Pullback was then performed which revealed a minimal LV-AO gradient.  Since the patient had aortic insufficiency on her echocardiogram, an aortogram was performed in the LAO projection with a single power injection of non-ionic contrast material.

The patient is status post resection of the dorsal nasal sidewall skin cancer with nasolabial flap reconstruction with subsequent deformity.  In particular, the patient has had effacement of his alar crease with deepening of his nasolabial fold and notable asymmetry.  The patient was seen in consultation and felt to be a surgical candidate for improvement.  Risks and benefits of the operation were described to the patient in detail including, but not limited to bleeding, infection, scarring, possible damage to surrounding structures including neurovascular structures, need for revision of surgery, continued asymmetry, and anesthetic complication.  The patient understood these risks and benefits and consented to the operation.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , The patient was taken to OR and placed supine on the operating table.  Dose of antibiotics was given to the patient.  Compression devices were placed on the lower extremities to prevent the knee embolic events.  The patient was turned to 180 degrees.  The ETT tube was secured and the area was then prepped and draped in usual sterile fashion.  A head wrap was then placed on the position and we then began our local.  Of note, the patient had previous incisions just lateral to his lateral canthus bilaterally and that were used for access.  Local consisting a 50:50 mix of 0.25% Marcaine with epinephrine and 1% lidocaine with epinephrine was then injected into the subperiosteal plane taking care to prevent injury to the infraorbital nerves.  This was done bilaterally.  We then marked the nasolabial fold and began with the elevation of the left midface.,We began with a lateral canthal-type incision extending out over his previous incision down to subcutaneous tissue.  We continued down to the lateral orbital rim until we identified periosteum.  We then pulled in a periosteal elevator and elevated the midface down over the zygoma elevating some lateral mesenteric attachments down over the buccal region until we felt we had reached pass the nasolabial folds medially.  Care was taken to preserve the infraorbital nerve and that was visualized after elevation.  We then released the periosteum distally and retracted up on the periosteum and noted improved contour of the nasolabial fold with increased bulk over the midface region over the zygoma.,We then used our Endotine Coapt device to engage the periosteum at the desired location and then elevated the midface and secured into position using the Coapt bioabsorbable screw.  After this was then carried out, we then clipped and cut as well as the end of the screw.  Satisfied with this, we then elevated the periosteum and secured it to reinforce our midface elevation to the lateral orbital rim and this was done using 3-0 Monocryl.  Several sutures were then used to anchor the orbicularis and deeper tissue to create additional symmetry.  Excess skin along the incision was then removed as well the skin from just lateral to the canthus.  Care was taken to leave the orbicularis muscle down.  We then continued closing our incision using absorbable plain gut 5-0 sutures for the subciliary-type incision and then continuing with interrupted 6-0 Prolenes lateral to the canthus.,We then turned our attention to performing the z-plasty portion of the case.  A z-plasty was designed along the previous scar where it was padding to the notable scar deformity and effacement of crease and the z-plasty was then designed to lengthen along the scar to improve the contour.  This was carried out using a 15 blade down to subcutaneous tissue.  The flaps were debulked slightly to reduce the amount of fullness and then transposed and sutured into place using chromic suture.  At this point, we then noted that he had improvement of the nasal fold but continued asymmetry with regards to improved bulk on the left side and less bulk on the right and it was felt that a symmetrization procedure was required to make more symmetry with the midface bilaterally and nasolabial folds bilaterally.  As such, we then carried out the dissection after injecting local as noted and we used a 15 blade scalpel to create our incision along the lateral canthus along its preexisting incision.  We carried this down to the lateral orbital rim again elevating the periosteum taking care to preserve infraorbital nerve.,At this point, we then released the periosteum distally just at the level of the nasolabial fold and placed our Endotine midface implant into the desired area and then elevated slightly just for symmetry only.  This was then secured in place using the bioabsorbable screw and then resected a very marginal amount of tissue just for removal of the dog ear deformity and closed the deeper layers of tissue using 3-0 PDS and then closing the extension to the subciliary area using 5-0 plain gut and then 6-0 Prolene lateral to the canthus.,At this point, we felt that we had achieved improved contour, improved symmetry, and decreased effacement of the nasolabial fold and alar crease.  Satisfied with our procedures, we then placed cool compresses on to the eyes.,The patient was then extubated and brought to the PACU in stable condition.,Dr. X was present and scrubbed for the entire case and actively participated during all key elements.  Dr. Y was available and participated in the portions of the case as well.\",\n",
       " 'PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Foreign body, right foot.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Foreign body in the right foot.,PROCEDURE PERFORMED:,  Excision of foreign body, right foot and surrounding tissue.,ANESTHESIA: , TIVA and local.,HISTORY:,  This 41-year-old male presents to preoperative holding area after keeping himself n.p.o., since mid night for removal of painful retained foreign body in his right foot.  The patient works in the Electronics/Robotics field and relates that he stepped on a wire at work, which somehow got into his shoe.  The wire entered his foot.  His family physician attempted to remove the wire, but it only became deeper in the foot.  The wound eventually healed, but a scar tissue was formed.  The patient has had constant pain with ambulation intermittently since the incident occurred.  He desires attempted surgical removal of the wire.  The risks and benefits of the procedure have been explained to the patient in detail by Dr. X.  The consent is available on the chart for review.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , After IV was established by the Department of Anesthesia, the patient was taken to the operating room via cart and placed on the operating table in a supine position with a safety strap placed across his waist for his protection.,A pneumatic ankle tourniquet was applied about the right ankle over copious amounts of Webril for the patient\\'s protection.  After adequate IV sedation was administered by the Department of Anesthesia, a total of 12 cc of 0.5% Marcaine plain was used to administer an ankle block.  Next, the foot was prepped and draped in the usual aseptic fashion.  An Esmarch bandage was used to exsanguinate the foot and the pneumatic ankle tourniquet was elevated to 250 mmHg.  The foot was lowered into the operative field and the sterile stockinet was reflected.  Attention was directed to the plantar aspect of the foot where approximately a 5 mm long cicatrix was palpated and visualized.  This was the origin and entry point of the previous puncture wound from the wire.  This cicatrix was found lateral to the plantar aspect of the first metatarsal between the first and second metatarsals in a nonweightbearing area.  Next, the Xi-scan was draped and brought into the operating room.  A #25 gauge needles under fluoroscopy were inserted into the plantar aspect of the foot and three planes to triangulate the wire.  Next, a #10 blade was used to make approximately a 3 cm curvilinear \"S\"-shaped incision.  Next, the #15 blade was used to carry the incision through the subcutaneous tissue.  The medial and lateral margins of the incision were undermined.  Due to the small nature of the foreign body and the large amount of fat on the plantar aspect of the foot, the wires seemed to serve no benefit other then helping with the incision planning.  Therefore, they were removed.  Once the wound was opened, a hemostat was used to locate the wire very quickly and the wire was clamped.  A second hemostat was used to clamp the wire.  A #15 blade was used to carefully transect the fatty tissue around the tip of the hemostats, which were visualized in the base of the wound.  The wire quickly came into visualization.  It measured approximately 4 mm in length and was approximately 1 mm in diameter.  The wire was green colored and metallic in nature.  It was removed with the hemostat and passed off as a specimen to be sent to Pathology for identification.  The wire was found at the level of deep fascia at the capsular level just plantar to the deep transverse intermetatarsal ligament.  Next, copious amounts of sterile gentamicin impregnated saline was instilled in the wound for irrigation and the wound base was thoroughly cleaned and inspected.  Next, a #3-0 Vicryl was used to throw two simple interrupted deep sutures to remove the dead space.  Next, #4-0 Ethibond was used to close the skin in a combination of simple interrupted and horizontal mattress suture technique.  The standard postoperative dressing consisting of saline-soaked Owen silk, 4x4s, Kling, Kerlix, and Coban were applied.  The pneumatic ankle tourniquet was released.  There was immediate hyperemic flush to the digits noted.  The patient\\'s anesthesia was reversed.  He tolerated the above anesthesia and procedure without complications.  The patient was transported via cart to the Postanesthesia Care Unit.,Vital signs were stable and vascular status was intact to the right foot.  He was given OrthoWedge shoe.  Ice was applied behind the knee and his right lower extremity was elevated on to pillows.  He was given standard postoperative instructions consisting of rest, ice and elevation to the right lower extremity.  He is to be non-weightbearing for three weeks, at which time, the wound will be evaluated and sutures will be removed.  He is to follow up with Dr. X on 08/22/2003 and was given emergency contact number to call if problems arise.  He was given a prescription for Tylenol #4, #30 one p.o. q.4-6h. p.r.n., pain as well as Celebrex 200 mg #30 take two p.o. q.d. p.c., with 200 mg 12 hours later as a rescue dose.

The patient also had a rent in the attachment of the hip abductors and a partial rent in the vastus lateralis.  This was revealed once we removed the trochanteric bursa.,HISTORY:  ,This is a 56-year-old obese female with a history of bilateral degenerative hip arthritis.  She underwent a right total hip arthroplasty by Dr. X in the year of 2000, and over the past three years, the symptoms in her left hip had increased tremendously especially in the past few months.,Because of the increased amount of pain as well as severe effect on her activities of daily living and uncontrollable pain with narcotic medication, the patient has elected to undergo the above-named procedure.  All risks as well complications were discussed with the patient including but not limited to infection, scar, dislocation, need for further surgery, risk of anesthesia, deep vein thrombosis, and implant failure.  The patient understood all these risks and was willing to continue further on with the procedure.,PROCEDURE: , The patient was wheeled back to the Operating Room #2 at ABCD General Hospital on 08/27/03.  The general anesthetic was first performed by the Department of Anesthesia.  The patient was then positioned with the left hip exposed on the beanbag in the lateral position.  Kidney rests were also used because of the patient's size.  An axillary roll was also inserted for comfort in addition to a Foley catheter, which was inserted by the OR nurse.  All her bony prominences were well padded.  At this time, the left hip and left lower extremity was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion for this procedure.  At this time, an anterolateral approach was then performed, first incising through the skin in approximately 5 to 6 inches of subcutaneous fat.  The tensor fascia lata was then identified.  A self-retainer was then inserted to expose the operative field.  Bovie cautery was used for hemostasis.  At this time, a fresh blade was then used to incise the tensor fascia lata over the posterior one-third of the greater trochanter.  At this time, a blunt dissection was taken proximally.  The tensor fascia lata was occluded with a hip retractor.  At this time, after hemostasis was obtained, Bovie cautery was used to incise the proximal end of the vastus lateralis and removing the partial portion of the hip abductor, the gluteus medius.  At this time, a periosteal elevator was used to expose anterior hip capsule.  A ________ was then inserted over the femoral head purchasing of the acetabulum underneath the reflected head of the quadriceps muscle.  Once this was performed, Homan retractors were then inserted superiorly and inferiorly underneath the femoral neck.  At this time, a capsulotomy was then performed using a Bovie cautery and the capsulotomy was ________ and then edged over the acetabulum.  At this point, a large bone hook was then inserted over the neck and with gentle traction and external rotation, the femoral head was dislocated out of the acetabulum.  At this time, we had an exposure of the femoral head, which did reveal degenerative changes of the femoral head and once the acetabulum was visualized, we did see degenerative changes within the acetabulum as well as osteophyte formation around the rim of the acetabulum.  At this time, a femoral stem guide was then used to measure proximal femoral neck cut.  We made a cut approximately a fingerbreadth above the lesser trochanter.  At this time, with protection of the soft tissues an oscillating saw was used to make femoral neck cut.,The femoral head was then removed.  At this time, we removed the leg out of the bag and Homan retractors were then used to expose the acetabulum.  A long-handle knife was used to cut through the remainder of the capsule and remove the glenoid labrum around the rim of the acetabulum.  With better exposure of the acetabulum, we started reaming the acetabulum.  We started with a size #44 and progressively reamed to a size #50.  At the size #50 mm reamer, we obtained excellent bony bleeding with good remainder of bone stalk both anteriorly and posteriorly as well as superiorly within the acetabulum.  We then reamed up to size #52 in order to get bony bleeding around the rim as well as anterior and posterior within the acetabulum.  A size 54 mm Trilogy cup was then implanted with excellent approaches approximately 45 degrees of abduction and 10 to 15 degrees of anteversion dialed in.  Once the cup was impacted in place, we did visualize that the cup was well seated on to the internal portion of the acetabulum.  At this time, two screws were the placed within the superior table for better approaches securing the acetabular cup.  At this time, a plastic liner was then inserted for protection.  The leg was then placed back in the bag.  A Bennett retractor was used to retract the tensor fascia lata and femoral elevator was used to elevate the femur for better exposure and at this time, we began working on the femur.  A rongeur was used to lateralize over the greater trochanter.  A Box osteotome was used to remove the cancellous portion of the femoral neck.  A Charnley awl was then used to cannulate through the proximal femoral canal.  A power reamer was then used to ream the lateral aspect of the greater trochanter in order to provide maximal lateralization and prevent varus implantation of our stem.  At this time, we began broaching.  We started with a size #10 and progressively worked up to a size #12 mm broach.  Once the 12 mm broach was inserted in place, it was seated approximately 1 mm below the calcar.  A calcar reamer was then placed and the calcar was reamed smoothly.  A standard neck as well as a 28 mm plastic head was then placed and a trial reduction was then performed.  Once this was performed, the hip was taken to range of motion with external rotation, longitudinal traction as well as flexion and revealed good stability with no impingement or dislocation.  At this time, we removed 12 mm broach and proceeded with implanting our polyethylene liner within the acetabulum.  This was impacted and placed and checked to assure that it was well seated with no loosening.  Once this was performed, we then exposed the proximal femur one more time.  We copiously irrigated within the canal and then suctioned it dry.  At this time, a 12 mm porous proximal collared stem, a femoral component was then impacted in place.  Once it was well seated on the calcar, we double checked to assure that there was no evidence of calcar fractures, which there were none.  The 28 mm zero neck length cobalt-chrome femoral head was then impacted in place and the Morse taper assured that this was well fixed by ________.,Next, the hip was then reduced within the acetabulum and again we checked range of motion as well as ligamentous stability with gentle traction, external rotation, as well as hip flexion.  We were satisfied with components as well as the alignment of the components.  Copious irrigation was then used to irrigate the wound.  #1 Ethibond was then used to approximate the anterior hip capsule.  #1 Ethibond in interrupted fashion was used to approximate the vastus lateralis as well as the gluteus medius attachment over the partial gluteus medius attachment which was resected off the greater trochanter.  Next, a #1 Ethibond was then used to approximate the tensor fascia lata with figure-of-eight closure.  A tight closure was performed.  Since the patient did have a lot of subcutaneous fat, multiple #2-0 Vicryl sutures were then used to approximate the bed space and then #2-0 Vicryl for the subcutaneous skin.  Staples were then used for skin closure.  The patient's hip was then cleansed.  Sterile dressings consisting of Adaptic, 4 x 4, ABDs, and foam tape were then placed.  A drain was placed prior to wound closure for postoperative drainage.  After the dressing was applied, the patient was extubated safely and transferred to recovery in stable condition.  Prognosis is good.\",\n",

After adequate spinal level was confirmed, a bimanual exam was again performed.  This revealed the uterus to be anteverted to axial and approximately 10 to 11 weeks in size.  The previously noted cervical exam was confirmed.  The weighted vaginal speculum was then inserted and the vaginal vault flooded with povidone solution.  This solution was then removed approximately 10 minutes later with dry sterile gauze sponge.  The anterior cervical lip was then attached with a ring clamp.  The tissue and membranes protruding through the os were then gently grasped with a ring clamp and traction applied.  The tissue dislodged revealing fluid mixed with blood as well as an apparent 10-week fetus.  The placental tissue was then gently tractioned out as well.  A size 9 curved suction curette was then gently inserted through the dilated os and into the endometrial cavity.  With the vacuum tubing applied in rotary motion, a moderate amount of tissue consistent with products of conception was evacuated.  The sharp curette was then utilized to probe the endometrial surface.  A small amount of additional tissue was then felt in the posterior uterine wall.  This was curetted free.  A second pass was then made with a vacuum curette.  Again, the endometrial cavity was probed with a sharp curette and no significant additional tissue was encountered.  A final pass was then made with a suction curette.,The ring clamp was then removed from the anterior cervical lip.  There was only a small amount of bleeding following the curettage.  The weighted speculum was then removed as well.  The bimanual exam was repeated and good involution was noted.  The patient was taken down from the dorsal lithotomy position.  She was transferred to the recovery room in stable condition.  The sponge and instrument count was performed and found to be correct.  The specimen of products of conception and 10-week fetus were submitted to Pathology for further evaluation.  The estimated blood loss for the procedure is less than 10 mL.\",\n",

Operative findings demonstrated the same with normal appearing tubes bilaterally.  The right ovary contained a right ovarian cyst.  The left ovary appeared to be within normal limits.  The peritoneal surfaces were noted to be within normal limits.  The bowel was also noted to be within normal limits.,INDICATIONS FOR THIS PROCEDURE: , The patient is a 44-year-old female who had an endometrial ablation done in May, which showed submucosal fibroids.  She had history of anemia and has been on iron therapy.  She started having bleeding three weeks ago with intermittent bouts of flooding.,She desired permanent and definitive therapy and therefore it was felt very appropriate to take the patient for a total abdominal hysterectomy.  The uterus, cervix, and right tube and ovary was sent to pathology for review.,PROCEDURE: , After informed consent was obtained, all questions were answered to the patient's satisfaction in layman's term.  She was taken to the operating room where a general anesthesia was obtained without any difficulty.  She was examined under anesthesia with noted findings above.  She was placed in a dorsal supine position and prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  The Pfannenstiel skin incision was made with the first knife and was then carried down to the underlying layer of the fascia.  With the second knife, the fascia was excised in the midline and extended laterally with the Mayo scissors.  The superior aspect of the fascial incision was then tented up with the Ochsner clamps and the underlying rectus muscle was dissected off sharply as well as bluntly.  Attention was then turned to the inferior aspect of the fascial incision, which in a similar fashion was tented up and the underlying rectus muscle was dissected off sharply as well as bluntly.  The rectus muscle was then separated in the midline, the peritoneum was identified, entered bluntly and digitally.  Then the peritoneal incision was then extended superior and inferiorly with excellent visualization of the bladder.  The GYN Balfour was then placed.  A Lahey clamp was placed on the fundus of the uterus to pull the uterus into the operative field and the bowel was packed away with moist laparotomy sponges.  Attention was then turned to the round ligaments bilaterally, which were tented up with Allis clamps and then a hemostat was poked through the avascular portion underneath the round ligament and the #O-tie was passed through and then tied down.  Then the round ligament was transected and suture ligated and noted to be hemostatic.  The round ligaments were then skeletonized to create a window in the broad ligament.  The right infundibulopelvic ligament was isolated through the window created from the round ligaments and then the infundibular ligament on the right was loop tied and then doubly clamped with straight Ochsner clamps and then transected and suture ligated with a #0 Vicryl in a Heaney stitch fashion.  It was noted to be hemostatic.  Attention was then turned to the left side, in which the uterovarian vessel was isolated and then tied with an #O-tie and then doubly clamped with straight Ochsner clamps, transected and suture ligated with a #0 Vicryl in a Heaney stitch fashion and noted to be hemostatic.  The vesicouterine peritoneum was then identified, tented up with Allis clamps, and then the bladder flap was created sharply with a Russian and Metzenbaum scissors.  Then the bladder was deflected off of the underlying cervix with blunt dissection with a moist Ray-Tec sponge down to the level of the cervix.,The uterine vessels were skeletonized bilaterally and then clamped with straight Ochsner clamps and transected and suture ligated and noted to be hemostatic.  In the similar fashion, the broad ligament down to the level of the caudal ligament, the uterosacral ligaments was clamped with curved Ochsner clamps and transected and suture ligated, and noted to be hemostatic.  The second Lahey clamp was then placed on the cervix.  The cervix was tented up and the pubocervical vesical fascia was transected with a long knife and then the vagina was entered with a double pointed scissors poked through well protecting posteriorly with a large malleable.  The cuff was then outlined.  The vaginal cuff was grasped with a Ochsner clamp and then the cervix, uterus, and the right tube and ovary were transected using the Jorgenson scissors.  The cuff outlined with Ochsner clamps.  The cuff was then painted with a Betadine soaked Ray-Tec sponge and the sponge was placed over the vagina.  The vaginal cuff was then closed with a #0 Vicryl in a running locked fashion holding on to the beginning end on the right side as well as incorporating the ipsilateral cardinal ligaments into the cuff angles.  A long Allis was then used to grasp the mid portion of the cuff and a #0 Vicryl figure-of-eight stitch was placed in the mid portion of the cuff and tied down.  At this time, the abdomen was copiously irrigated with warm normal saline and noted to be hemostatic.  The suture that was used to close the cuff was then used to come back through the posterior peritoneum grabbing the uterosacral ligaments and the mid portion of the cuff, and then tied down to bring the cuff close and together.  Then, the right round ligament was pulled into the cuff and tied down with the #0 Vicryl that was used as a figure-of-eight stitch in the middle of the cuff.  The left round ligament was too small to reach the cuff.  The abdomen was then again copiously irrigated with warm normal saline and noted to be hemostatic.  The peritoneum was then re-peritonealized with a #3-0 Vicryl in a running fashion.  The GYN Balfour and all packing sponges were removed from the abdomen.  Then the abdomen was then once again copiously irrigated and the cuff and incision sites were once again reinspected and noted to be hemostatic.  The ______ was placed back into the hollow of the sacrum.  The omentum was then pulled over to top of the bowel and then the peritoneum was then closed with a #3-0 Vicryl in a running fashion and then the fascia was closed with #0 Vicryl in a running fashion.  The skin was closed with staples and dressing applied.  The patient was then examined at the end of the procedure.  The Betadine-soaked sponge was removed from the vagina.  The cuff was noted to be intact without bleeding and the patient tolerated the procedure well.  Sponge, lap, and needle counts were correct x2 and she was taken to the recovery in stable condition.  The patient will be followed throughout her hospital stay.\",\n",

The patient also has had this right upper lid skin lesion which appears to be a cholesterol granuloma for numerous months.  It appears to be growing in size and is irregularly bordered.  After risks, complications, consequences, and questions were addressed to the patient, a written consent was obtained for the procedure.,PROCEDURE: , The patient was brought to the operating suite by Anesthesia and placed on the operating table in supine position.  After this, the patient was turned to 90 degrees by the Department of Anesthesia.  The right upper eyelid skin lesion was injected with 1% lidocaine with epinephrine 1:100,000 approximately 1 cc total.  After this, the patient's bilateral nasal passages were then packed with cocaine-soaked cottonoids of 10% solution of 4 cc total.  The patient was then prepped and draped in usual sterile fashion and the right upper lid skin was then first cut around the skin lesion utilizing a Superblade.  After this, the skin lesion was then grasped with a ________ in the  superior aspect and the skin lesion was cut and removed in the subcutaneous plane utilizing Westcott scissors.  After this, the ________ was then hemostatically controlled with monopolar cauterization.  The patient's skin was then reapproximated with a running #6-0 Prolene suture.  A Mastisol along with a single Steri-Strip was in place followed Maxitrol ointment.  Attention then was drawn to the nasopharynx.  The cocaine-soaked cottonoids were removed from the nasal passages bilaterally and zero-degree otoscope was placed all the way to the patient's nasopharynx.  The patient had a severely deviated nasal septum more so to the right than the left.  There appeared to be a spur on the left inferior aspect and also on the right posterior aspect.  The nasopharyngeal mass appeared polypoid in nature almost lymphoid tissue looking.  It was then localized with 1% lidocaine with epinephrine 1:100,000 of approximately 3 cc total.  After this, the lesion was then removed on the right side with the XPS blade.  The torus tubarius was noted on the left side with the polypoid lymphoid tissue involving this area completely.  This area was taken down with the XPS blade.  Prior to taking down this lesion with the XPS, multiple biopsies were taken with a straight biter.  After this, a cocaine-soaked cottonoid was placed back in the patient's left nasal passage region and the nasopharynx and the attention was then drawn to the right side.  The zero-degree otoscope was placed in the patient's right nasal passage and all the way to the nasopharynx.  Again, the XPS was then utilized to take down the nasopharyngeal mass in its entirety with some involvement overlying the torus tubarius.  After this, the patient was then hemostatically controlled with suctioned Bovie cauterization.  A FloSeal was then placed followed by bilateral Merocels and bacitracin-coated ointment.

The patient presented with mild bruising over the proximal arm of the right side with x-ray showing no fracture.  Over concerns for pectoralis tendon tear, he was sent for MRI evaluation where a complete rupture of a portion of the pectoralis major tendon was noted.  Due to the patient's young age and active lifestyle surgical treatment was recommended in order to obtain best result.  The risks and benefits of the procedure were discussed in detail with the patient including, but not limited to scarring, infection, damage to blood vessels and nerves, re-rupture, need further surgery, loss of range of motion, inability to return to heavy activity such as weight lifting, complex usual pain syndrome, and deep vein thrombosis as well as anesthetic risks.  Understanding all risks and benefits, the patient desires to proceed with surgery as planned.,FINDINGS:,1.  Following deltopectoral approach to the right shoulder, the pectoralis major tendon was encountered.  The clavicular head was noted to be intact.  There was noted to be complete rupture of the sternal head of the pectoralis major tendon with an oblique-type tear having some remaining cuff on the humerus and some tendon attached to the retracted portion.,2.  Following freeing of adhesions using tracks and sutures, the pectoralis major tendon was able to reapproximated to its insertion site on the humerus just lateral to the biceps.,3.  A soft tissue repair was performed with #5 FiberWire suture and a single suture anchor of 5 x 5 bioabsorbable anchor was placed in order to decrease tension at the repair site.  Following repair of soft tissue and using the bone anchor, there was noted to be good apposition of the tendon with edges and a solid repair.,OPERATIVE REPORT IN DETAIL: , The patient was identified in the preop holding area.  His right shoulder was identified, marked his appropriate surgical site after verification with the patient.  He was then taken to the operating room where he was transferred to the operative table in supine position and placed under general anesthesia by anesthesiology team.  He then received prophylactic antibiotics.  A time-out was then undertaken verifying the correct patient, extremity, surgery performed, administration of antibiotics, and the availability of equipment.  At this point, the patient was placed to a modified beech chair position with care taken to ensure all appropriate pressure points were padded and there was no pressure over the eyes.  The right upper extremity was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  Preoperative markings were still visible at this point.  A deltopectoral incision was made utilizing the inferior portion.  Dissection was carried down.  The deltoid was retracted laterally.  The clavicular head of the pectoralis major was noted to be intact with the absence of the sternal insertion.  There was a small cuff of tissue left on the proximal humerus associated with the clavicular head.  Gentle probing medially revealed the end of the sternal retracted portion, traction sutures of #5 Ethibond were used in this to allow for retraction and freeing from light adhesion.  This allowed reapproximation of the retracted tendon to the tendon stump.  At this point, a repair using #5 FiberWire was then performed of the pectoralis major tendon back to stump on the proximal humerus noting good apposition of the tendon edges and no gapping of the repair site.  At this point, a single metal suture anchor was attempted to be implanted just lateral to the insertion of the pectoralis in order to remove tension off the repair site; however, the inserted device attached to the metal anchor broke during insertion due to significant hardness of the bone.  For this reason, the starting hole was tapped and a 5x5 bioabsorbable anchor was placed, doubly loaded.  The sutures were then weaved through the lateral aspect of the torn tendon and a modified Krackow type performed and sutured thereby relieving tension off the soft tissue repair.  At this point, there was noted to be excellent apposition of the soft tissue ends and a solid repair to gentle manipulation.  Aggressive external rotation was not performed.  The wound was then copiously irrigated.  The cephalic vein was not injured during the case.  The skin was then closed using a 2-0 Vicryl followed by a 3-0 subcuticular Prolene suture with Steri-Strips.  Sterile dressing was then placed.  Anesthesia was then performed, interscalene block.  The patient was then awakened from anesthesia and transported to postanesthesia care in stable condition in a shoulder immobilizer with the arm adducted and internally rotated.,Plan for this patient, the patient will remain in the shoulder immobilizer until followup visit in approximately 10 days.  We will then start a gentle Codman type exercises and having limited motion until the 4-6 week point based on the patient's progression.\",\n",

This was felt to be related largely to chronic obstructive lung disease.  She had dynamic T-wave changes in precordial leads.  Cardiac enzymes were indeterminate.  She was evaluated by Dr. X and given her previous history and multiple risk factors it was elected to proceed with cardiac catheterization and coronary angiography.,Risks of the procedure including risks of conscious sedation, death, cerebrovascular accident, dye reaction, need for emergency surgery, vascular access injury and/or infection, and risks of cath-based interventions were discussed in detail.  The patient understood and agreed to proceed.,DESCRIPTION OF THE PROCEDURE: , The patient was brought to the cardiac catheterization laboratory.  Under Versed and fentanyl sedation, the right groin was sterilely prepped and draped.  Local anesthesia was obtained with 2% Xylocaine.  The right femoral artery was entered using modified Seldinger technique and a 4-French introducer sheath placed in that vessel.  Through the indwelling femoral arterial sheath, a JL4 4-French catheter was advanced over the wire to the ascending aorta, appropriately aspirated and flushed.  Ascending aortic root pressures obtained.  This catheter was utilized in an attempt to cannulate the left coronary ostium.  This catheter was too small, was exchanged for a JL5 4-French catheter, which was advanced over the wire to the ascending aorta, the cath appropriately aspirated and flushed, and advanced to left coronary ostium and multiple views of left coronary artery obtained.,This catheter was then exchanged for a 4-French right coronary catheter, which was advanced over the wire to the ascending aorta.  The catheter appropriately aspirated and flushed.  The catheter was advanced in the right coronary artery.  Multiple views of that vessel were obtained.  The catheter was then sequentially advanced to the saphenous vein graft to the diagonal branch, saphenous vein graft to the obtuse marginal branch, and left internal mammary artery, left anterior descending coronary artery, and multiple views of those vessels were obtained.  This catheter was then exchanged for a 4-French pigtail catheter, which was advanced over the wire to the ascending aorta.  The catheter was appropriately aspirated and flushed and advanced to left ventricle, baseline left ventricular pressures obtained.,Following this, left ventriculography was performed in a 30-degree RAO projection using 30 mL of contrast injected over 3 seconds.  Post left ventriculography pressures were then obtained as was a pullback pressure across the aortic valve.  Videotapes were then reviewed.

He has had a positive symptomology of locking and pain since then.  He had no frank instability to it, however.,GROSS OPERATIVE FINDINGS: , We did find a tear to the medial meniscus as well as a large area of chondromalacia to the medial femoral condyle.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was taken to the operating room.  The left lower extremity was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  Tourniquet was applied to the left thigh with adequate Webril padding, not inflated at this time.  After the left lower extremity had been prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion, we applied an Esmarch tourniquet, exsanguinating the blood and inflated the tourniquet to 325 mmHg for a total of 19 minutes.  We established the lateral port of the knee with #11 blade scalpel.  We put in the arthroscopic trocar, instilled with water and inserted the camera.,On inspection of the patellofemoral joint, it was found to be quite smooth.  Pictures were taken there.  There was no evidence of chondromalacia, cracking, or fissuring of the articular cartilage.  The patella was well centered over the trochlear notch.  We then directed the arthroscope to the medial compartment of the knee.  It was felt that there was a tear to the medial meniscus.  We also saw large area of chondromalacia with grade-IV changes to bone over the medial femoral condyle.  This area was debrided with forceps and the arthroscopic shaver.  The cartilage was also smoothened over the medial femoral condyle.  This was curetted after the medial meniscus had been trimmed.  We looked into the notch.  We saw the ACL appeared stable, saw attachments to tibial as well as the femoral insertion with some evidence of laxity, wear and tear.  Attention then was taken to the lateral compartment with some evidence of tear to the lateral meniscus and the arterial surface of both the tibia as well as the femur were pristine in the lateral compartment.  All instruments were removed.  All loose cartilaginous pieces were suctioned from the knee and water was suctioned at the end.  We removed all instruments.  Marcaine was injected into the portal sites.  We placed a sterile dressing and stockinet on the left lower extremity.  He was transferred to the gurney and taken to PACU in stable condition.',\n",

The risks as explained included, but are not limited to pain, bleeding, infection, decreased or loss of vision/loss of eye, retinal detachment requiring further surgery, and possible consultation out of town, swelling of the back part of the eye/retina, need for prolonged eye drop use or injections, instability of the lens, and loss of corneal clarity necessitating long-term drop use or further surgery.  The possibility of needing intraocular lens exchange or incorrect lens power was discussed.  Anesthesia option and risks associated with anesthesia and retrobulbar anesthesia were discussed.  It was explained that some or all of these complications might arise at the time of or months to years after surgery.  The patient had a good understanding of the risks with the proposed, elective eye surgery.  The patient accepted these risks and elected to proceed with cataract surgery.  All questions were answered and informed consent was signed and placed in the chart.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: , The patient was identified and the procedure was verified.  The pupil was dilated per protocol.  The patient was taken to the operating room and placed in the supine position.  After intravenous sedation, the retrobulbar block was injected followed by several minutes of digital massage.  No signs of orbital tenseness or retrobulbar hemorrhage were present.,The patient was prepped and draped in the usual ophthalmic sterile fashion.  An eyelid speculum was used to separate the eyelids.  A crescent blade was used to make a clear corneal temporally located incision.  A 1-mm Dual-Bevel blade was used to make a paracentesis site.  The anterior chamber was filled with viscoelastic (Viscoat).  The crescent blade was then used to make an approximate 2-mm long clear corneal tunnel through the temporal incision.  A 2.85-mm keratome blade was then used to penetrate into the anterior chamber through the temporal tunneled incision.  A 25-gauge pre-bent cystotome used to begin a capsulorrhexis.  The capsulorrhexis was completed with the Utrata forceps.  A 27-guage needle was used for hydrodissection and three full and complete fluid waves were noted.  The lens was able to be freely rotated within the capsular bag.  Divide-and-conquer ultrasound was used for phacoemulsification.  After four sculpted grooves were made, a bimanual approach with the phacoemulsification tip and Koch spatula was used to separate and crack each grooved segment.

He is almost 3 years old.  He presented with 2 months of irritability, vomiting, and increasing seizures.  CT scan was not conclusive, but shuntogram shows no flow through the shunt.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: , After induction of general anesthesia, the patient was placed supine on the operating room table with his head turned to the left.  Scalp was clipped.  He was prepped on the head, neck, chest and abdomen with ChloraPrep.  Incisions were infiltrated with 0.5% Xylocaine with epinephrine 1:200,000.  He received oxacillin.,He was then reprepped and draped in a sterile manner.,The frontal incision was reopened and extended along the valve.  Subcutaneous sharp dissection with Bovie cautery was done to expose the shunt parts.  I separated the ventricular catheter from the valve, and this was a medium pressure small contour Medtronic valve.  There was some flow from the ventricular catheter, but not as much as I would expect.  I removed the right-angled clip with a curette and then pulled out the ventricular catheter, and there was gushing of CSF under high pressure.  So, I do believe that the catheter was obstructed, although inspection of the old catheter holes did not show any specific obstructions.  A new Codman BACTISEAL catheter was placed through the same hole.  I replaced it several times because I wanted to be sure it was in the cavity.  It entered easily and there was still just intermittent flow of CSF.  The catheter irrigated very well and seemed to be patent.,I tested the distal system with an irrigation filled feeding tube, and there was excellent flow through the distal valve and catheter.  So I did not think it was necessary to replace those at this time.  The new catheter was trimmed to a total length of 8 cm and attached to the proximal end of the valve.  The valve connection was secured to the pericranium with a #2-0 Ethibond suture.  The wound was irrigated with bacitracin irrigation.  The shunt pumped and refilled well.  The wound was then closed with #4-0 Vicryl interrupted galeal suture and Steri-Strips on the skin.  It was uncertain whether this will correct the problem or not, but we will continue to evaluate.  If his abdominal pressure is too high, then he may need a different valve.  This will be determined over time, but at this time, the shunt seemed to empty and refill easily.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  No complications.  Sponge and needle counts were correct.  Blood loss was minimal.  None replaced.',\n",

The right side prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  Next, using a 15 blade scalpel, two incisions were made, one in the parietooccipital region and.  The second just lateral to the umbilicus.  Once this was clear, the Bactiseal catheter was then tunneled.  This was connected to a Strata valve.  The Strata valve was programmed to a setting of 1.01 and this was ensured.  The small burr hole was then created.  The area was then coagulated.  Once this was completed, new Bactiseal catheter was then inserted.  It was connected to the Strata valve.  There was good distal flow.  The distal end was then inserted into the peritoneal region via trocar.  Once this was insured, all the wounds were irrigated copiously and closed with 3-0 Vicryl and 4-0 Caprosyn as well as Indermil glue.  The right frontal incision was then opened.

The patient last underwent a right frontal ventricular peritoneal shunt on 10/12/07.  This resulted in relief of left chest pain, but the patient continued to complaint of persistent pain to the left shoulder and left elbow.  She was seen in clinic on 12/11/07 during which time MRI of the left shoulder showed no evidence of rotator cuff tear.  She did have a previous MRI of the cervical spine that did show an osteophyte on the left C6-C7 level.  Based on this, negative MRI of the shoulder, the patient was recommended to have anterior cervical discectomy with anterior interbody fusion at C6-C7 level.  Operation, expected outcome, risks, and benefits were discussed with her.  Risks include, but not exclusive of bleeding and infection, bleeding could be soft tissue bleeding, which may compromise airway and may result in return to the operating room emergently for evacuation of said hematoma.  There is also the possibility of bleeding into the epidural space, which can compress the spinal cord and result in weakness and numbness of all four extremities as well as impairment of bowel and bladder function.  Should this occur, the patient understands that she needs to be brought emergently back to the operating room for evacuation of said hematoma.  There is also the risk of infection, which can be superficial and can be managed with p.o. antibiotics.  However, the patient may develop deeper-seated infection, which may require return to the operating room.  Should the infection be in the area of the spinal instrumentation, this will cause a dilemma since there might be a need to remove the spinal instrumentation and/or allograft.  There is also the possibility of potential injury to the esophageus, the trachea, and the carotid artery.  There is also the risks of stroke on the right cerebral circulation should an undiagnosed plaque be propelled from the right carotid.  There is also the possibility hoarseness of the voice secondary to injury to the recurrent laryngeal nerve.  There is also the risk of pseudoarthrosis and hardware failure.  She understood all of these risks and agreed to have the procedure performed.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: , The patient brought to the operating room, awake, alert, not in any form of distress.  After smooth induction and intubation, a Foley catheter was inserted.  Monitoring leads were placed by Premier Neurodiagnostics and this revealed normal findings, which remained normal during the entire case.  The EMGs were silent and there was no evidence of any stimulation.  After completion of the placement of the monitoring leads, the patient was positioned supine on the operating table with the neck placed on hyperextension.  The head was supported on a foam doughnut.  The right cervical area was then exposed by turning the head about 45 to 60 degrees to the left side.  A linear incision was made about two to three fingerbreadths from the suprasternal notch along the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle to a distance of about 3 cm.  The area was then prepped with DuraPrep.,After sterile drapes were laid out, the incision was made using a scalpel blade #10.  Wound edge bleeders were controlled with bipolar coagulation and a hot knife was utilized to carry the dissection down to the platysma in the similar fashion as the skin incision.  The anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle was identified as well as the sternohyoid/omohyoid muscles.  Dissection was then carried lateral and superior to the omohyoid muscle and lateral to the esophagus and the trachea, and medial to the sternocleidomastoid muscle and the carotid sheath.  The prevertebral fascia was identified and cut sharply.  A localizing x-ray verified the marker to be at the C6-C7 interspace.  Proceeded to the strip the longus colli muscles off the vertebral body of C6 and C7.  Self-retaining retractor was then laid out.  The annulus was then cut in a quadrangular fashion and piecemeal removal of the dura was done using a straight pituitary rongeurs, 3 and 5 mm burr.  The interior endplate of C6 and superior endplate of C7 was likewise was drilled down together with posteroinferior edge of C6 and the posterior superior edge of C7.  There was note of a new osteophyte on the left C6-C7 foramen.  This was carefully drilled down.  After decompression and removal of pressure, there was noted to be release of the epidural space with no significant venous bleeders.  They were controlled with slight bipolar coagulation, temporary tamponade with Gelfoam.  After this was completed, Valsalva maneuver showed no evidence of any CSF leakage.  A 7-mm implant was then tapped into placed after its interior was packed with Vitoss.  The plate was then applied and secured in place with four 12 x 4.7 mm screws.  Irrigation of the area was done.  A round French 10 JP drain was laid out over the graft and exteriorized through a separate stab incision on the patient's right inferiorly.  The wound was then closed in layers with Vicryl 3-0 inverted interrupted sutures as well as Vicryl 4-0 subcuticular stitch for the dermis.  The wound was reinforced with Dermabond.  The catheter was anchored to the skin with nylon 3-0 stitch and dressing was applied only at the exit site.  C-collar was placed and the patient was transferred to Recovery after extubation.\",\n",

The patient had a cystoscopy done, which showed enlargement of the left lateral lobes of the prostate.  At this point, options were discussed such as watchful waiting and laser vaporization to open up the prostate to get a better stream.  Continuation of alpha-blockers and adding another anti-cholinergic at night to prevent bladder overactivity were discussed.  The patient was told that his symptoms may be related to the mild-to-moderate trabeculation in the bladder, which can cause poor compliance.,The patient understood and wanted to proceed with laser vaporization to see if it would help improve his stream, which in turn might help improve emptying of the bladder and might help his overactivity of the bladder.  The patient was told that he may need anticholinergics.  There could be increased risk of incontinence, stricture, erectile dysfunction, other complications and the consent was obtained.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:  ,The patient was brought to the OR and anesthesia was applied.  The patient was placed in dorsal lithotomy position.  The patient was given preoperative antibiotics.  The patient was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  A #23-French scope was inserted inside the urethra into the bladder under direct vision.  Bilateral pyelograms were normal.  The rest of the bladder appeared normal except for some moderate trabeculations throughout the bladder.  There was enlargement of the lateral lobes of the prostate.  The old TUR scar was visualized right at the bladder neck.  Using diode side-firing fiber, the lateral lobes were taken down.  The verumontanum, the external sphincter, and the ureteral openings were all intact at the end of the procedure.  Pictures were taken and were shown to the family.  At the end of the procedure, there was good hemostasis.  A total of about 15 to 20 minutes of lasering time was used.  A #22 3-way catheter was placed.

       " 'CHART NOTE:,  She is here to discuss possible open lung biopsy that she has actually scheduled for tomorrow.  Dr. XYZ had seen her because of her complaints of shortness of breath.  Then she had the pulmonary function test and CT scan and he felt that she probably had usual interstitial pneumonitis, but wanted her to have an open lung biopsy so he had her see Dr. XYZ Estep.  He had concurred with Dr. XYZ that an open lung biopsy was appropriate and she was actually scheduled for this but both Dr. XYZ and I were unavailable before the procedure was originally scheduled so he had it delayed so that she could talk with us prior to having the biopsy.  She was ready to go ahead with this and felt that it was important she find out why she is short of breath.  She is very concerned about the findings on her CAT scan and pulmonary function test.  She seemed alarmed to report that Dr. XYZ had found that her lung capacity was reduced to 60% of what should be normal.  However, I told her that two years ago Dr. XYZ did pulmonary function studies which showed the same change in function.  And that really her pulmonary function test, at least compared from two years ago, had not really changed over this period of time.  After discussing the serious nature of an open lung biopsy, the fact that her pulmonary function studies have not changed in two years, the fact that she likely has a number of other things that are contributing to her being out of breath, which is deconditioning and obesity, she seemed comfortable with the thought of simply monitoring this a little bit longer before undergoing something as risky as an open lung biopsy.  In fact when I called Dr. XYZ to talk to him about cancelling the procedure, he stated he would be very uncomfortable with doing an open lung biopsy on someone with pulmonary function studies which had not changed.  I also explained to patient that I did not think Dr. XYZ was aware that she had had pulmonary function studies two years previously and certainly did not know that there results of those.  And also I spoke with Dr. XYZ who agreed that although the two different tests may have some minor differences accounting for some of the similarity in results that may or may not be completely accurate, that generally a person with progressive interstitial lung disease without a fairly substantial change on pulmonary function tests even if they were done at different facilities.,I had a 30-minute discussion with patient about all of this and showed her the different test results and had a lengthy talk with her about the open lung biopsy and she ultimately felt very uncomfortable with going ahead and decided to cancel it.  I also told her we could continue to monitor her breathing problems and continue to monitor her CAT scan, x-ray, and pulmonary function tests.  And if there was some sign that this was a progressive problem, she could still go ahead with the lung biopsy.  But she needed to understand that the treatment and likely diagnosis found from an open lung biopsy were not highly likely to be of any great help to her.  She understands that the diagnoses made from open lung biopsy are not all that specific and that the treatment for the few specific things that can be detected are not often well tolerated or extremely helpful.,We are going to see her back in a month to see how her breathing is doing.  We will cancel her open lung biopsy for tomorrow and decide whether she should follow up with a pulmonologist at that time.  I told her I would try to talk to her sister sometime in the next day or two.',\n",

Then, the exposed branch varicosities both in the lower third of the thigh and in the calf were dissected out and then many stabs were performed to do stab phlebectomies at the level of the thigh and the level of the calf as much as the position would allow us to do.,Then in the left thigh, a groin incision was made and the greater saphenous vein was dissected out in the same way as was on the other side.  Also, an incision was made in the level of the knee and the saphenous vein was isolated there.  The saphenous vein was stripped and a several minutes of local compression was performed for hemostasis.  Then, a number of stabs to perform phlebectomy were performed at the level of the calf to excise branch varicosities to the extent that the patient's position would allow us.  Then, all incisions were closed in layers with Vicryl and staples.,Then, the patient was placed in the prone position and the stab phlebectomies of the right thigh and calf and left thigh and calf were performed using 10 to 20 stabs in each leg.  The stab phlebectomies were performed with a hook and they were very satisfactory.  Hemostasis achieved with compression and then staples were applied to the skin.,Then, the patient was rolled onto a stretcher where both legs were wrapped with the Kerlix, fluffs, and Ace bandages.,Estimated blood loss probably was about 150 mL.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and was sent to recovery room in satisfactory condition.  The patient is to be observed, so a decision will be made whether she needs to stay overnight or be able to go home.\",\n",
       " 'PROCEDURE:,  Total hip replacement.,PROCEDURE DESCRIPTION:,  The patient was bought to the operating room and placed in the supine position.  After induction of anesthesia, the patient was turned on the side and secured in the hip table.  An incision was made, centered over the greater trochanter.  Dissection was sharply carried down through the subcutaneous tissues.  The gluteus maximus was incised and split proximally.  The piriformis and external rotators were identified.  These were removed from their insertions on the greater trochanter as a sleeve with the hip capsule.  The hip was dislocated.  A femoral neck cut was made using the guidance of preoperative templating.  The femoral head was removed.  Extensive degenerative disease was found on the femoral head as well as in the acetabulum.,Baseline leg-length measurements were taken.  The femur was retracted anteriorly and a complete labrectomy was performed.  Reaming of the acetabulum was then performed until adequate bleeding subchondral bone was identified in the key areas.  The trial shell was placed and found to have an excellent fit.  The real shell was opened and impacted into position in the appropriate amount of anteversion and abduction.  Screws were placed by drilling into the pelvis, measuring, and placing the appropriate length screw.  Excellent purchase was obtained.  The trial liner was placed.,The femur was then flexed and internally rotated.  The extra trochanteric bone was removed, as was any leftover lateral soft tissue at the piriformis insertion.  An intramedullary hole was drilled into the femur to define the canal.  Reaming was performed until the appropriate size was reached.  The broaches were then used to prepare the femur with the appropriate amount of version.  Once the appropriate size broach was reached, it was used as a trial with head and neck placement.  Hip range-of-motion was checked in all planes, including flexion-internal rotation, the position of sleep, and extension-external rotation.  The hip was found to have excellent stability with the final chosen head-neck combination.  Leg length measurements were taken and found to be within acceptable range, given the necessity for stability.,The real stem was opened and impacted into position.  The real head was impacted atop the stem.  If cement was used, the canal was thoroughly washed and dried and plugged with a restrictor, and then the cement was injected and pressurized and the stem was implanted in the appropriate version.  Excess cement was removed from the edges of the component.  Range of motion and stability were once again checked and found to be excellent.  Adequate hemostasis was obtained.  Vigorous power irrigation was used to remove all debris from the joint prior to final reduction.,The arthrotomy and rotators were closed using #1 Ethibond through drill holes in the bone, recreating the posterior hip structural anatomy.  The gluteus maximus was repaired using 0 Ethibond and 0 Vicryl.  The subcutaneous tissues were closed after further irrigation with 2-0 Vicryl and Monocryl sutures.  The skin was closed with nylon.  Xeroform and a sterile dressing were applied followed by a cold pack and Ace wrap.  The patient was transferred to the recovery room in stable condition, having tolerated the procedure well.',\n",

All questions were answered.  The patient was brought to preoperative holding area where the operative right eye was marked.  He was brought to the operating room and placed in the supine position.  EKG leads were placed.  General anesthesia was induced by the anesthesia service.  A time-out was called to confirm the procedure and operative eye.  The right operative eye was disinfected and draped in a standard fashion for eye surgery.  A lid speculum was placed.  The vitreoretinal team placed the infusion cannula after performing a peritomy.  At this point in the case, the patient was turned over to the cornea service with Mrs. Jun.  A paracentesis was made at the approximately 3 o'clock position.  Healon was placed into the anterior chamber.  The diamond keratome was used to make a vertical groove incision just inside the limbus at the 108-degree axis.  This incision was then shelved anteriorly and used to enter the anterior chamber.  The Utrata forceps were used to complete a continuous circular capsulorrhexis after incision of the capsule with the cystotome.  Hydrodissection was performed.  The lens nucleus was removed using phacoemulsification and irrigation and aspiration.  Lens cortex also was removed using irrigation and aspiration.  Viscoelastic was placed to inflate the capsular remnant.  The diamond knife was used to enlarge the phaco incision.  Intraocular lens was selected from preoperative calculations, placed in the injector system, and inserted into the capsule without difficulty.  The trailing haptic was placed using the Sheets forceps and the Barraquer sweep to push the IOL optic posteriorly as the trailing haptic was placed.  The anterior cornea wound was sutured along with the paracentesis after irrigation and aspiration was performed to remove remaining viscoelastic from the anterior chamber.  This was done without difficulty.  The anterior chamber was secured and watertight at the end of the procedure.  Intraocular pressure was satisfactory.

There is either neovascularization on the iris or reactive iris vessels, it is difficult to discern.  This seems to be complete iris synechia to the anterior lens capsule.  There is a posterior chamber intraocular lens with an inflammatory debris on the anterior surface.  The anterior chamber appears narrow.  On the left, there is also dense inflammation at 4+ cell.

There is some inferior vitreous debris.,ASSESSMENT/PLAN:,  Chronic bilateral recurrent nongranulomatous diffuse uveitis.  Currently, there is very severe right eye inflammation and severe left eye.  I discussed at length with the patient that this will likely take an oral steroid to quite her down.  Since she has only one seeing eye, I am anxious to obtain a decreased inflammation as soon as possible.  She has been on oral steroids in the past.  We also discussed, considering the aggressive recurrent nature of this process, it is likely we will have to consider a steroid sparing agent to maintain longer term control of this recurrent process so that we do not use visual acuity in the left.  I anticipate we will likely start methotrexate in the near future.  In this acute phase, I have recommended oral steroids at a dose of 60 mg a day, hourly topical Pred Forte as well as atropine sulfate.  We will watch her closely in clinic.  I am sending a copy of this dictation to her primary care doctor, she said she has had a negative HLA-B27, rheumatoid factor, and ANA in the past.  At this stage, to be thorough I would ask Dr. X to assist us in repeating her chest x-ray, PPD if not current, and an RPR.  Additionally, in anticipation of need for methotrexate, it would be helpful to have a full liver function profile as well as hepatitis B and hepatitis C.',\n",

History related to this illness probably dates back to October of 2006 when he had onset of swelling and discomfort in the left testicle with what he described as a residual \"lump\" posteriorly.  The left testicle has continued to be painful off and on since.  In early November, he developed pain in the posterior part of his upper right leg, which he initially thought was related to skateboarding and muscle strain.  Physical therapy was prescribed and the discomfort temporarily improved.  In December, he noted onset of increasing fatigue.  He used to work out regularly, lifting lifts, doing abdominal exercises, and playing basketball and found he did not have energy to pursue these activities.  He has lost 10 pounds since December and feels his appetite has decreased.  Night sweats and cough began in December, for which he was treated with a course of Augmentin.  However, both of these problems have continued.  He also began taking Accutane for persistent acne in December (this agent was stopped on 02/19/2007).  Despite increasing fatigue and lethargy, he continues his studies at University of Denver, has a biology major (he aspires to be an ophthalmologist).,The morning of 02/19/2007, he awakened with severe right inguinal and right lower quadrant pain.  He was seen in Emergency Room where it was noted that he had an elevated WBC of 18,000.  CT scan of the abdomen was obtained to rule out possible appendicitis and on that CT, a large clot in the inferior vena cava extending to the right iliac and femoral veins was found.  He promptly underwent appropriate treatment in interventional radiology with the above-noted angioplasty and placement of a vena caval filter followed by mechanical and pharmacologic thrombolysis.  Repeat ultrasound there on 02/20/2007 showed no evidence of deep venous thrombosis (DVT).  Continuous intravenous unfractionated heparin infusion was continued.  Because there was no obvious cause of this extensive thrombosis, occult malignancy was suspected.  Appropriate blood studies were obtained and he underwent a PET/CT scan as part of his diagnostic evaluation.  This study showed moderately increased diffuse bone marrow metabolic activity.  Because the WBC continued to rise and showed a preponderance of lymphocytes, the smear was reviewed by pathologist, Sheryl Asplund, M.D., and flow cytometry was performed on the peripheral blood.  These studies became available the afternoon of 02/23/2007, and confirmed the diagnosis of precursor-B acute lymphoblastic leukemia.

He also has a mildly raised brown lesion that the patient states has been there ever since he can remember and has not changed in size or caliber.  His testicles are descended bilaterally.  There are no masses.,ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: , This is likely molluscum contagiosum (genital warts) caused by HPV.  I did state to the patient that this is likely a viral infection that could have had a long incubation period.  It is not clear where this came from but it is most likely sexually transmitted.  He is instructed that he should use protected sex from this point on in order to try and limit the transmission.  Regarding the actual lesion itself, I did mention that we could apply a cream of Condylox, which could take up to a month to work.  I also offered him C02 laser therapy for the genital warts, which is an outpatient procedure.  The patient is very interested in something quick and effective such as a CO2 laser procedure.  I did state that the recurrence rate is significant and somewhere as high as 20% despite enucleating these lesions.  The patient understood this and still wished to proceed.  There is minimal risk otherwise except for those inherent in laser injury and accidental injury.  The patient understood and wished to proceed.\",\n",

He also has persistent tonsillitis with hypertrophy and tonsillolith and halitosis.  He also has developed tremendous edema to his posterior palate and uvula, which is causing choking.  Correction of these mechanical abnormalities is indicated.,DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION:  ,The patient was placed on the operating room table in the supine position.  After adequate general endotracheal anesthesia was administered, the right and left nasal septal mucosa and right and left inferior turbinates were anesthetized with 1% lidocaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine using approximately 10 mL.  Afrin-soaked pledgets were placed in the nasal cavity bilaterally.  The face was prepped with pHisoHex and draped in a sterile fashion.  A hemitransfixion incision was performed on the left with a #15 blade and submucoperichondrial and mucoperiosteal flap was raised with the Cottle elevator.  Anterior to the septal deflection, the septal cartilage was incised and an opposite-sided submucoperichondrial and mucoperiosteal flap was raised with the Cottle elevator.  The deviated portion of the nasal septal cartilage and bone was removed with a Takahashi forceps, and a large inferior septal spur was removed with a V-chisel.  Once the septum was reduced in the midline, the hemitransfixion incision was closed with a 4-0 Vicryl in an interrupted fashion.  The right and left inferior turbinates were trimmed in a submucous fashion using straight and curved turbinate scissors under direct visualization with a 4 mm 0 degree Storz endoscope.  Hemostasis was acquired by using suction electrocautery.  The turbinates were then covered with bacitracin ointment after cauterizing them and bacitracin ointment soaked Doyle splints were placed in the right and left nares and secured anteriorly to the columella with a 3-0 nylon suture.  The table was then turned.  A shoulder roll placed under the shoulders and the face was draped in a clean fashion.  A McIvor mouth gag was applied.  The tongue was retracted and the McIvor was gently suspended from the Mayo stand.  The left tonsil was grasped with a curved Allis forceps, retracted medially, and the anterior tonsillar pillar was incised with Bovie electrocautery.  The tonsil was removed from the superior pole to inferior pole using a Bovie electrocautery in its entirety in a subcapsular fashion.  The right tonsil was grasped in a similar fashion, retracted medially, and the anterior tonsillar pillar was incised with Bovie electrocautery.  The tonsil was removed from the superior pole to inferior pole using Bovie electrocautery in its entirety in a subcapsular fashion.  The inferior, middle, and superior pole vessels were further cauterized with suction electrocautery.  The extremely edematous portion of soft palate was resected using a right angle clamp and right angle scissor and was closed with 3-0 Vicryl in a figure-of-eight interrupted fashion.  Copious saline irrigation of the oral cavity was then performed.  There was no further identifiable bleeding at the termination of the procedure.  The estimated blood loss was less than 10 mL.  The patient was extubated in the operating room, brought to the recovery room in satisfactory condition.  There were no intraoperative complications.',\n",

       " \"DIAGNOSIS: , Aortic valve stenosis with coronary artery disease associated with congestive heart failure.  The patient has diabetes and is morbidly obese.,PROCEDURES: , Aortic valve replacement using a mechanical valve and two-vessel coronary artery bypass grafting procedure using saphenous vein graft to the first obtuse marginal artery and left radial artery graft to the left anterior descending artery.,ANESTHESIA: , General endotracheal,INCISION: , Median sternotomy,INDICATIONS: , The patient presented with severe congestive heart failure associated with the patient's severe diabetes.  The patient was found to have moderately stenotic aortic valve.  In addition, The patient had significant coronary artery disease consisting of a chronically occluded right coronary artery but a very important large obtuse marginal artery coming off as the main circumflex system.  The patient also has a left anterior descending artery which has moderate disease and this supplies quite a bit of collateral to the patient's right system.  It was decided to perform a valve replacement as well as coronary artery bypass grafting procedure.,FINDINGS: , The left ventricle is certainly hypertrophied· The aortic valve leaflet is calcified and a severe restrictive leaflet motion.  It is a tricuspid type of valve.  The coronary artery consists of a large left anterior descending artery which is associated with 60% stenosis but a large obtuse marginal artery which has a tight proximal stenosis.,The radial artery was used for the left anterior descending artery.  Flow was excellent.  Looking at the targets in the posterior descending artery territory, there did not appear to be any large branches.  On the angiogram these vessels appeared to be quite small.  Because this is a chronically occluded vessel and the patient has limited conduit due to the patient's massive obesity, attempt to bypass to this area was not undertaken.  The patient was brought to the operating room,PROCEDURE: , The patient was brought to the operating room and placed in supine position.  A median sternotomy incision was carried out and conduits were taken from the left arm as well as the right thigh.  The patient weighs nearly three hundred pounds.  There was concern as to taking down the left internal mammary artery.  Because the radial artery appeared to be a good conduit The patient would have arterial graft to the left anterior descending artery territory.  The patient was cannulated after the aorta and atrium were exposed and full heparinization.,The patient went on cardiopulmonary bypass and the aortic cross-clamp was applied Cardioplegia was delivered through the coronary sinuses in a retrograde manner.  The patient was cooled to 32 degrees.  Iced slush was applied to the heart.  The aortic valve was then exposed through the aortic root by transverse incision.  The valve leaflets were removed and the #23 St. Jude mechanical valve was secured into position by circumferential pledgeted sutures.  At this point, aortotomy was closed.,The first obtuse marginal artery was a very large target and the vein graft to this target indeed produced an excellent amount of flow.  Proximal anastomosis was then carried out to the foot of the aorta.  The left anterior descending artery does not have severe disease but is also a very good target and the radial artery was anastomosed to this target in an end-to-side manner.  The two proximal anastomoses were then carried out to the root of the aorta.,The patient came off cardiopulmonary bypass after aortic cross-clamp was released.  The patient was adequately warmed.  Protamine was given without adverse effect.  Sternal closure was then done using wires.  The subcutaneous layers were closed using Vicryl suture.  The skin was approximated using staples.\",\n",

He is a 57-year-old assembly worker who was injured on June 13, 2007, which according to his FROI was due to \"repairing cars, down on knees to work on concrete floors.\"  In addition, he slipped on an air hose on the floor at work on March 7, 2007, re-injuring his left knee.  He developed pain and swelling in his left knee.  He denies having any difficulties with his left knee prior to the injury of June 13, 2002.,DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES: , August 2, 2002, MRI of the left knee showed low-grade chondromalacia of the left patellofemoral joint space and a posterior horn tear of the medial meniscus, likely degenerative in nature, and also grade II to III chondromalacia of the medial joint space.  On June 26, 2007, MRI of his left knee was referred to in the injury management report of June 19, 2007, as showing osteoarthritis of the medial compartment has advanced.  He brought with him copies of x-rays taken July 16, 2007, of his left knee, which I reviewed and which showed marked narrowing of the medial compartment of his left knee with spurs on the margins of the joint medially and also spurs on the patella.  There was subluxation of the tibia on the femur with standing.,After his injury, he received treatment from Dr. X for patellofemoral syndrome with knee sleeve.  He also received treatment from Dr. Y also for left knee sprain and patellar pain.  He also did exercise, does use a knee sleeve and Aleve.  On December 5, 2002, he underwent arthroscopy of the left knee by Dr. Z who did a partial resection of a torn medial meniscus.  He also noticed grade III chondromalacia of the patella as well as the torn medial meniscus.  He states that he was asymptomatic until he slipped on an air hose while at work on March 7, 2007, and again developed pain and swelling in his left knee.  Standing aggravates his pain.  He has had one injection of cortisone by Dr. Z about a month ago, which has helped his pain.  He takes one hydrocodone 7.5/750 mg daily.,Examination of his left knee revealed there was bilateral varus deformity, healed arthroscopy incisional scars, there was a 1/2 atrophy of the left calf.  There was patellar crepitus with knee motion.  There was no motor weakness or reflex changes.  He walked without a limp and could stand on his heels and toes equally well.  There was no instability of the knee and no effusion.  Range of motion was 0 to 120 degrees.,QUESTION: , Xxxxx has recently filed to reactivate this claim.  Please give me your opinion as to whether Xxxxx\\'s current clinical presentation is related to the industrial injury stated above.,ANSWER:, Yes.  His original MRI of August 2, 2002, did show low-grade chondromalacia of the patellofemoral joint and also grade II to III chondromalacia of the medial joint space, which was the beginning of osteoarthritis.  Also, it is well known that torn medial meniscus can result in osteoarthritis of the knee; therefore, the osteoarthritis is related to his original injury of June 13, 2007, specifically to the torn medial meniscus.,QUESTION:  ,Do I believe that claim #123 should be reactivated to allow for treatment of the allowed conditions as stated?,ANSWER:, Yes, I believe it should be reactivated to allow treatment of the contested condition of osteoarthritis of his left knee.,QUESTION:,  Xxxxx has filed an application for additional allowance of osteoarthritis of the left knee.  Based on the current objective findings, mechanism of injury, medical records, and diagnostic studies, does the medical evidence support the existence of the requested condition?,ANSWER: ,Yes.

       " \"REASON FOR VISIT: , Followup left-sided rotator cuff tear and cervical spinal stenosis.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , Ms. ABC returns today for followup regarding her left shoulder pain and left upper extremity C6 radiculopathy.  I had last seen her on 06/21/07.,At that time, she had been referred to me Dr. X and Dr. Y for evaluation of her left-sided C6 radiculopathy.  She also had a significant rotator cuff tear and is currently being evaluated for left-sided rotator cuff repair surgery, I believe on, approximately 07/20/07.  At our last visit, I only had a report of her prior cervical spine MRI.  I did not have any recent images.  I referred her for cervical spine MRI and she returns today.,She states that her symptoms are unchanged.  She continues to have significant left-sided shoulder pain for which she is being evaluated and is scheduled for surgery with Dr. Y.,She also has a second component of pain, which radiates down the left arm in a C6 distribution to the level of the wrist.  She has some associated minimal weakness described in detail in our prior office note.  No significant right upper extremity symptoms.  No bowel, bladder dysfunction.  No difficulty with ambulation.,FINDINGS: , On examination, she has 4 plus over 5 strength in the left biceps and triceps muscle groups, 4 out of 5 left deltoid, 5 out of 5 otherwise in both muscle groups and all muscle groups of upper extremities.  Light touch sensation is minimally decreased in the left C6 distribution; otherwise, intact.  Biceps and brachioradialis reflexes are 1 plus.  Hoffmann sign normal bilaterally.  Motor strength is 5 out of 5 in all muscle groups in lower extremities.  Hawkins and Neer impingement signs are positive at the left shoulder.,An EMG study performed on 06/08/07 demonstrates no evidence of radiculopathy or plexopathy or nerve entrapment to the left upper extremity.,Cervical spine MRI dated 06/28/07 is reviewed.  It is relatively limited study due to artifact.  He does demonstrate evidence of minimal-to-moderate stenosis at the C5-C6 level but without evidence of cord impingement or cord signal change.  There appears to be left paracentral disc herniation at the C5-C6 level, although axial T2-weighted images are quite limited.,ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: , Ms. ABC's history, physical examination and radiographic findings are compatible with left shoulder pain and left upper extremity pain, which is due to a combination of left-sided rotator cuff tear and moderate cervical spinal stenosis.,I agree with the plan to go ahead and continue with rotator cuff surgery.  With regard to the radiculopathy, I believe this can be treated non-operatively to begin with.  I am referring her for consideration of cervical epidural steroid injections.  The improvement in her pain may help her recover better from the shoulder surgery.,I will see her back in followup in 3 months, at which time she will be recovering from a shoulder surgery and we will see if she needs any further intervention with regard to the cervical spine.,I will also be in touch with Dr. Y to let him know this information prior to the surgery in several weeks.\",\n",

A tourniquet applied to the upper arm.  The extremity was prepped in a usual manner for a surgical procedure and draped off.  The superficial vessels were exsanguinated with an elastic wrap and the tourniquet was then inflated to the usual arm pressure.  A curved incision was made over the presenting ganglion over the dorsal aspect of the wrist.  By blunt and sharp dissection, it was dissected out from underneath the extensor tendons and the stalk appeared to arise from the distal radiocapitellar joint and the dorsal capsule was excised along with the ganglion and the specimen was removed and submitted.  The small superficial vessels were electrocoagulated and instilled after closing the skin with 4-0 Prolene, into the area was approximately 6 to 7 mL of 0.25 Marcaine with epinephrine.  A Jackson-Pratt drain was inserted and then after the tourniquet was released, it was kept deflated until at least 5 to 10 minutes had passed and then it was activated and then removed in the recovery room.  The dressings applied to the hand were that of Xeroform, 4x4s, ABD, Kerlix, and elastic wrap over a volar fiberglass splint.  The tourniquet was released.  Circulation returned to the fingers.

       " \"CHIEF COMPLAINT: , Both pancreatic and left adrenal lesions.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:,  This 60-year-old white male is referred to us by his medical physician with a complaint of recent finding of a both pancreatic lesion and lesions with left adrenal gland.  The patient's history dates back to at the end of the January of this past year when he began experiencing symptoms consistent with difficulty almost like a suffocating feeling whenever he would lie flat on his back.  He noticed whenever he would recline backwards, he would begin this feeling and it is so bad now that he can barely recline, very little before he has this feeling.  He is now sleeping in an upright position.  He was sent for CAT scan originally of his chest.  The CAT scan of the chest reveals a pneumonitis, but also saw a left adrenal nodule and a small pancreatic lesion.  He was subsequently was sent for a dedicated abdominal CAT scan and MRI.  The CAT scan revealed 1.8-cm lesion of his left adrenal gland, suspected to be a benign adenoma.  The pancreas showed pancreatic lesion towards the mid body tail aspect of the pancreas, approximately 1 cm, most likely of cystic nature.  Neoplasm could not be excluded.  He was referred to us for further assessment.  He denies any significant abdominal pain, any nausea or vomiting.  His appetite is fine.  He has had no significant changes in his bowel habits or any rectal bleeding or melena.  He has undergone a colonoscopy in September of last year and was found to have three adenomatous polyps.  He does have a history of frequent urination.  Has been followed by urologist for this.  There is no family history of pancreatic cancer.

       " \"HISTORY AND PHYSICAL:  ,The patient is a 13-year-old, who has a history of Shone complex and has a complete heart block.  He is on the pacemaker.  He had a coarctation of the aorta and that was repaired when he was an infant.  He was followed in our Cardiology Clinic here and has been doing well.  However last night, he was sleeping, and he states he felt as if he has having a dream, and there was thunder in this dream, which woke him up.  He then felt that his defibrillator was going off and this has continued and feels like his heart rate is not normal.  Thus, his dad put him in the car and transported him here.  He has been evaluated here.  He had some scar tissue at one point when the internal pacemaker was not working properly and had to have that replaced.  It was 2 a.m. when he woke, and again, he was brought here by private vehicle.  He was well prior to going to bed.  No cough, cold, runny nose, fever.  No trauma has been noted.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:,  Shone complex, pacemaker dependent.,MEDICATIONS: , He is on no medications at this time.,ALLERGIES:,  He has no allergies.,IMMUNIZATIONS:,  Up to date.,SOCIAL HISTORY: , He lives with his parents.,FAMILY HISTORY: , Negative.,REVIEW OF SYSTEM: , Twelve asked, all negative, except as noted above.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,GENERAL:  This is an awake, alert male, who appears to be in mild distress.,HEENT:  Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light.  Extraocular movements are intact.  His TMs are clear.  His nares are clear.  The mucous membranes are pink and moist.  Throat is clear.,NECK:  Supple without lymphadenopathy or masses.  Trachea is midline.,LUNGS:  Clear.,HEART:  Shows bradycardia at 53.  He has good distal pulses.,ABDOMEN:  Soft, nontender.  Positive bowel sounds.  No guarding, no rebound.  No rashes are seen.,HOSPITAL COURSE:,  Initial blood pressure is 164/90.  He was moved in room 1.  He was placed on nasal cannula.  Pulse ox was 100%, which is normal.  We placed him on a monitor.  We did an EKG; it has not appear to be capturing his pacemaker at this time.  Shortly after the patient's arrival, the Medtronic technician came and worked out his pacemaker.  Medtronic representative informed me that the lead that he has in place has been recalled because it has been prone to microfractures, oversensing, and automatic defibrillation.  As noted, he was transferred to room 1, placed on a monitor, pulse ox.  An IV was placed.  A standard blood work was sent.  A chest x-ray was done showing normal heart size, lead appeared to be in placed.  There was no evidence of pulmonary edema.  His pacemaker did not appear to be capturing.  We placed him on transthoracic leads.  However, it is difficult to get good placement with these because of the area where his pacemaker was placed.  The Medtronic technician initially turned off his defibrillation mode and turned down his sensor.  However, we could not get our transthoracic pacer to capture his heart.  When the Medtronic representative turned off the pacemaker, the heart rate seemed to drop into the 40s.  The patient appeared to be in pain.  We placed it back on a rate of 60 at that time.  He has remained in sinus bradycardia, but no evidence of ectopic beats.  No widening of his QRS complex.  I spoke with Cardiology.  Cardiology service has come in, has evaluated him at bedside with me.  Again, we turned up the transthoracic pacer, but it is again not seem to be picking up, and his heart rate is still going with the Medtronic's internal pacemaker.  So with the ICU physician on call, Dr. X, he has agreed with taking this young man to the ICU.,An hour after presentation here, the ICU was ready for bed.  I accompanied the patient up to the ICU.  He remained awake and alert.  Initially, he was complaining of a lot of chest pain.  Once the defibrillator was turned off, he had no more pain.  He was transported to the Pediatrics PICU and delivered in stable condition.,LABORATORY DATA: , CBC was normal.  Chem-20 was normal as well.,IMPRESSION:  ,Complete heart block with pacemaker malfunction.,PLAN:  ,He is admitted to the ICU.,TIME SEEN: , Critical care time outside billable procedures was 45 minutes with this patient.

Removal of loose bodies.,3.  Medial femoral chondroplasty.,4.  Medial meniscoplasty.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was taken to the operative suite, placed in supine position, and administered a general anesthetic by the Department of Anesthesia.  Following this, the knee was sterilely prepped and draped as discussed for this procedure.  The inferolateral and inferomedial portals were then established; however, prior to this, a graft was harvested from the semitendinosus and gracilis region.  After the notch was identified, then ACL was confirmed and ruptured.  There was noted to be a torn, slipped up area of the medial meniscus, which was impinging and impinged on the articular surface.  The snare was smoothed out.  Entire area was thoroughly irrigated.  Following this, there was noted in fact to be significant degenerative changes from this impingement of the meniscus again to the periarticular cartilage.  The areas of the worn away portion of the medial femoral condyle was then debrided and ________ chondroplasty was then performed of this area in order to stimulate bleeding and healing.  There were multiple loose bodies noted in the knee and these were then __________ and then removed.  The tibial and femoral drill holes were then established and the graft was then put in place, both which locations after a notchplasty was performed.  The knee was taken through a full range of motion without any impingement.  An Endobutton was used for proximal fixation.  Distal fixation was obtained with an independent screw and a staple.  The patient was then taken to Postanesthesia Care Unit at the conclusion of the procedure.,',\n",
       " \"HISTORY: , The patient is a 5-1/2-year-old, who recently presented with a cardiac murmur diagnosed due to a patent ductus arteriosus.  An echocardiogram from 09/13/2007 demonstrated a 3.8-mm patent ductus arteriosus with restrictive left-to-right shunt.  There is mild left atrial chamber enlargement with an LA/AO ratio of 1.821.  An electrocardiogram demonstrated normal sinus rhythm with possible left atrial enlargement and left ventricular hypertrophy.  The patient underwent cardiac catheterization for device closure of a ductus arteriosus.,PROCEDURE:  ,After sedation and local Xylocaine anesthesia, the patient was prepped and draped.  Cardiac catheterization was performed as outlined in the attached continuation sheets.  Vascular entry was by percutaneous technique, and the patient was heparinized.  Monitoring during the procedure included continuous surface ECG, continuous pulse oximetry, and cycled cuff blood pressures, in addition to intravascular pressures.,Using a 5-French sheath, a 5-French wedge catheter was inserted into the right femoral vein and advanced through the right heart structures up to the branch pulmonary arteries.  The atrial septum was not probe patent.,Using a 4-French sheath, a 4-French marker pigtail catheter was inserted into the right femoral artery advanced retrograde to the descending aorta, ascending aorta, and left ventricle.  A descending aortogram demonstrated a small, type A patent ductus arteriosus with a small left-to-right angiographic shunt.  Minimal diameter was approximately 1.6 mm with ampulla diameter of 5.8 mm and length of 6.2 mm.  The wedge catheter could be directed from the main pulmonary artery across the ductus arteriosus to the descending aorta.  This catheter exchanged over wire for a 5-French nit-occlude delivery catheter through which a nit-occlude 6/5 flex coil that was advanced and allowed to reconfigure the descending aorta.  Entire system was then brought into the ductal ampulla or one loop of coil was delivered in the main pulmonary artery.  Once the stable device configuration was confirmed by fluoroscopy, device was released from the delivery catheter.  Hemodynamic measurements and angiogram in the descending aorta were then repeated approximately 10 minutes following device implantation.,Flows were calculated by the Fick technique using a measured assumed oxygen consumption and contents derived from Radiometer Hemoximeter saturations and hemoglobin capacity.,Cineangiograms were obtained with injection in the descending aorta.,After angiography, two normal-appearing renal collecting systems were visualized.  The catheters and sheaths were removed and topical pressure applied for hemostasis.  The patient was returned to the recovery room in satisfactory condition.  There were no complications.,DISCUSSION: , Oxygen consumption was assumed to be normal.  Mixed venous saturation was normal with a slight increased saturation of the branch pulmonary arteries due to left-to-right shunt through the ductus arteriosus.  The left-sided heart was fully saturated.  The phasic right-sided and left-sided pressures were normal.  The calculated systemic flow was normal and pulmonary flow was slightly increased with a QP:QS ratio of 1:1.  Vascular resistances were normal.  A cineangiogram with contrast injection in the descending aorta showed a small conical shaped ductus arteriosus with a small left-to-right angiographic shunt.  The branch pulmonary arteries appeared normal.  There is otherwise a normal left aortic arch.,Following coil embolization of the ductus arteriosus, there is no change in mixed venous saturation.  No evidence of residual left-to-right shunt.  There is no change in right-sided pressures.  There is a slight increase in the left-sided phasic pressures.  Calculated systemic flow was unchanged from the resting state and pulmonary flow was similar with a QP:QS ratio of 1:1.  Final angiogram with injection in the descending aorta showed a majority of coil mass to be within the ductal ampulla with minimal protrusion in the descending aorta as well as the coil in the main pulmonary artery.  There is a trace residual shunt through the center of coil mass.,INITIAL DIAGNOSES:, Patent ductus arteriosus.,SURGERIES (INTERVENTIONS):  ,Coil embolization of patent ductus arteriosus.,MANAGEMENT:  ,The case to be discussed at Combined Cardiology/Cardiothoracic Surgery case conference.

We have discussed the risks, benefits and alternatives to operative versus nonoperative treatment.  Based on his age and his activity level, I think his best option is for operative fixation.  We went over the risks of bleeding, infection, damage to nerves and blood vessels, rerupture of the tendon, weakness and the need for future surgery.  We have discussed doing this as an outpatient procedure.  He would be nonweightbearing in a splint for 10 days, nonweightbearing in a dynamic brace for 4 weeks, and then a walking boot for another six weeks with a lift until three months postop when we can get him into a shoe with a ¼\" lift.  He understands a 6-9 month return to sports overall.  He will also need to be on some Lovenox for a week after surgery and then on an aspirin as he is going to travel back to Angola.

       " 'NAME OF PROCEDURE,1.  Left heart catheterization with left ventriculography and selective coronary angiography.,2.  Percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty and stent placement of the right coronary artery.,HISTORY: , This is a 58-year-old male who presented with atypical chest discomfort.  The patient had elevated troponins which were suggestive of a myocardial infarction.  The patient is suspected of having significant obstructive coronary artery disease, therefore he is undergoing cardiac catheterization.,PROCEDURE DETAILS: , Informed consent was given prior to the patient was brought to the catheterization laboratory.  The patient was brought to the catheterization laboratory in postabsorptive state.  The patient was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion, 2% Xylocaine solution was used to anesthetize the right femoral region.  Using modified Seldinger technique, a 6-French arterial sheath was placed.  Then, the patient had already been on heparin.  Then, a Judkins left 4 catheter was intubated into the left main coronary artery.  Several projections were obtained and the catheter was removed.  A 3DRC catheter was intubated into the right coronary artery.  Several projections were obtained and the catheter was removed.  Then, a 3DRC guiding catheter was intubated into the right coronary artery.  Then, a universal wire was advanced across the lesion into the distal right coronary artery.  Integrilin was given.  Then, a 3.0 x 12 Voyager balloon was inflated at 13 atmospheres for 30 seconds.  Then, a projection was obtained.  Then, a 3.0 x 15 Vision stent was placed into the distal right coronary artery.  The stent was deployed at 15 atmospheres for 25 seconds.  Post stent, the patient was given intracoronary nitroglycerin after one projection.  Then, there was an attempt to place the intervention wire across the third posterolateral branch which was partially obstructed and this was not successful.  Then, a pilot 150 wire was advanced across the lesion.  Then, attempt to place the 2.0 x 8 power saver across the lesion was performed.  However, it was felt that there was adequate flow and no further intervention needed to be performed.  Then, the stent delivery system was removed.  A pigtail catheter was placed into the left ventricle.  Hemodynamics followed by left ventriculography was performed.  Then, a pullback gradient was performed and the catheter was removed.  Then, the right femoral artery was visualized and using angiography and then an Angio-Seal was applied.  The patient was transferred back to his room in good condition.,FINDINGS,1.  Hemodynamics:  The opening aortic pressure was 116/61 with a mean of 64.  The opening left ventricular pressure was 112 with end-diastolic pressure of 23.  LV pressure on pullback was 106 with end-diastolic pressure of 21.  Aortic pressure was 111/67 with a mean of 87.  The closing pressure was 110/67.,2.  Left ventriculography:  The left ventricle was of normal cavity, size, and wall thickness.  There is a mild anterolateral hypokinesis and moderate inferior and inferoapical hypokinesis.  The overall systolic function appeared to be mildly reduced with ejection fraction between 40% and 45%.  The mitral valve had no significant prolapse or regurgitation.  The aortic valve appeared to be trileaflet and moved normally.,3.  Coronary angiography:  The left main is a normal-caliber vessel.  This bifurcates into the left anterior descending and circumflex arteries.  The left main is free of any significant obstructive coronary artery disease.  The left anterior descending is a large vessel that extends to the apex.  It gives off approximately 10 septal perforators and 5 diagonal branches.  The first diagonal branch was large.  The left anterior descending had mild irregularities, but no high-grade disease.  The left circumflex is a nondominant vessel, which gives rise to two obtuse marginal branches.  The two obtuse marginal branches are large.  There is a relatively small left atrial branch.  The left circumflex had a 50% stenosis after the first obtuse marginal branch.  The rest of the vessel is moderately irregular, but no high-grade disease.  The right coronary artery appears to be a dominant vessel, which gives rise to three right ventricular branches, four posterior lateral branches, two right atrial branches, and two small conus branches.  The right coronary artery had moderate disease in its proximal segment with multiple areas of plaquing but no high-grade disease.  However, distal between the second and third posterolateral branch, there is a 90% stenosis.  The rest of the vessels had mild irregularities, but no high-grade disease.  Then percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty of the right coronary artery resulted in a 20% residual stenosis.  Then, after stent placement there was 0% residual stenosis; however, there was partial occlusion of the third posterolateral branch.  Then, a wire was advanced through this and there was improvement of flow.  There is improvement from TIMI grade 2 to TIMI grade 3 flow.,CLINICAL IMPRESSION,1.  Successful percutaneous transluminal angioplasty and stent placement of the right coronary artery.,2.  Two-vessel coronary artery disease.,3.  Elevated left ventricular end-diastolic pressure.,4.

A midline incision was made in the center of the knee and was carried down sharply to the retinacular tissue.  The starting guidewire was used to localize the correct starting point, which is on the medial aspect of the lateral tibial eminence.  This was advanced and confirmed on the AP and lateral fluoroscopic images.  The opening reamer was then used and the ball-tip guidewire was passed.  The reduction was obtained over a large radiolucent triangle.  After passing the guidewire and achieving appropriate reduction, the flexible reamers were then sequentially passed, starting at 9 mm up to 11.5 mm reamer.  At this point, a 10 x 390 mm was passed without difficulty.  The guide was used to the proximal locking screw and the appropriate circle technique was used to the distal locking screws.  The final images were taken with fluoroscopy and a 15-mm end-cap was placed.  The wounds were then irrigated and closed with 2-0 Vicryl followed by staples to the distal screws and 0 Vicryl followed 2-0 Vicryl and staples to the proximal incision.

He was refractory to conservative outpatient therapy.  He had injection of his AC joint, which removed symptoms but was not long lasting.  After discussing the alternatives of the care as well as advantages and disadvantages, risks, complications, and expectations, he elected to undergo the above-stated procedure on this date.,Intraarticular viewing of the joint revealed a partial rotator cuff tear on the supraspinatus insertion on the joint side.  All else was noted to be intact including the glenohumeral joint, the long head of the biceps, and the labrum.  The remainder of the rotator cuff observed was noted to be intact.  Subacromially, the patient was noted to have increased synovitis.  Degenerative changes were noted upon observation of the distal clavicle.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE: , The patient was laid supine upon the operative table.  After receiving interscalene block anesthetic by Anesthesia Department, the patient was placed in modified beach chair position.  He was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.  Portals were created posteriorly and anteriorly from outside to in.  A full and complete diagnostic intraarticular arthroscopy was carried out.  Debridement was carried out through a 3.5 meniscal shaver to the 4.2 meniscal shaver to the undersurface of the partial tear of the rotator cuff.  Retrospectively it was approximately 25% of the generalized thickness.,Attention was then turned to the subacromial region.  The scope was directed subacromially.  A portal was created laterally.  Ultimately, the patient needed a general anesthetic once we were closer to the distal clavicle.  Gross bursectomy was carried out with a 4.2 meniscal shaver.  #18-gauge spinal needles have been placed to outline the anterior acromion prior to this.,It was difficult to control the patient's blood pressure with systolics ranging anywhere from 165 or 170 up to 200.  Because of this and difficulties with his anesthetic, it was elected to change to an open procedure.  Thus, the patient was anesthetized safely and secured.  An oblique incision was carried at the cross Langer's line across the outlet of the shoulder through the skin and subcutaneous tissue.  Hemostasis was controlled via electrocoagulation.  Flaps were created.  Anterior deltoid was reflected inferiorly.  Anterior acromioplasty was carried out with a saw then a Micro-Aire and then a beaver-tail rasp.  An excellent decompression was present.  CA ligament had been previously resected.  We then took the incision over the distal clavicle.  The end of the distal clavicle approximately 12 mm to 14 mm was isolated and removed with the Micro-Aire saw.  The beaver-tail rasp was utilized to smooth off the edges.  Pain buster catheter was placed deep to closure of the AC capsule and then to the deltoid with interrupted #1 Vicryl.  Transosseous sutures were placed across the acromion and the deltoid was elevated and closed with the same.  A superficial running #2-0 Vicryl suture was utilized for deltoid closure distally.  Interrupted #2-0 Vicryl was utilized to subcutaneous fat closure, running #4-0 subcuticular stitch for skin closure and Adaptic, 4x4s, ABDs, and Elastoplast tape placed for compression dressing.  0.25% Marcaine was flooded into the joint prior to the skin closure.  Pain buster catheter was hooked up.  The patient's arm was placed in arm sling.  He was safely transferred to the PACU in apparent satisfactory condition.  Expected surgical prognosis on this patient is fair.\",\n",

At no time during the case was evidence of CSF leakage, and hemostasis was readily achieved with pledgets of Gelfoam subsequently removed with copious amounts of antibiotic irrigation.  Once the decompression was inspected with a double ball dissector and all found to be completely decompressed, and the dura bulged at the interspace, and pulsated, then a Bengal cage was filled with the patient's own bone elements and fusion putty and countersunk into position, and was quite tightly applied.  Further stability was added nonetheless with an appropriate size Uniplate, which was placed of appropriate size with appropriate size screws and these were locked into place in the usual manner.  The wound was inspected, and irrigated again with antibiotic solution and after further inspection was finally closed in a routine closure in a multiple layer event by first approximation of the platysma with interrupted 3-0 Vicryl, and the skin with a subcuticular stitch of 4-0 Vicryl, and this was Steri-Stripped for reinforcement, and a sterile dressing was applied, incorporating a Penrose drain, which was carried from the prevertebral space externally to the skin wound and safety pin for security in the usual manner.  Once the sterile dressing was applied, the patient was taken from the operating room to the recovery area having left in stable condition.,At the conclusion of the case, all instruments, needle, and sponge counts were accurate and correct, and there were no intraoperative complications of any type.\",\n",

       " \"TITLE OF OPERATION:,  Total laryngectomy, right level 2, 3, 4 neck dissection, tracheoesophageal puncture, cricopharyngeal myotomy, right thyroid lobectomy.,INDICATION FOR SURGERY: , A 58-year-old gentleman who has had a history of a T3 squamous cell carcinoma of his glottic larynx having elected to undergo a laser excision procedure in late 06/07.  Subsequently, biopsy confirmed tumor persistence in the right glottic region.  Risks, benefits, and alternatives of the surgical intervention versus possibility of chemoradiation therapy were discussed with the patient in detail.  Also concerned for a CT scan finding of possible cartilaginous invasion at the cricoid level.  The patient understood the issues regarding surgical intervention and wished to undergo a surgical intervention despite a clear understanding of risks, benefits, and alternatives.  He was accompanied by his wife and daughter.  Risks included, but were not limited to anesthesia, bleeding, infection, injury of the nerves including lower lip weakness, tongue weakness, tongue numbness, shoulder weakness, need for physical therapy, possibility of total laryngectomy, possibility of inability to speak or swallow, difficulty eating, wound care issues, failure to heal, need for additional treatment, and the patient understood all of these issues and they wished to proceed.,PREOP DIAGNOSIS: , Squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx.,POSTOP DIAGNOSIS: , Squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx.,PROCEDURE DETAIL: , After identifying the patient, the patient was placed supine on the operating room table.  After the establishment of the general anesthesia via oral endotracheal intubation, the patient had his eyes protected with Tegaderm.  A #6 endotracheal tube was placed initially.  Direct laryngoscopy was performed with a Lindholm laryngoscope.  A 0-degree endoscope was used to take pictures of what was apparently a recurrence of tumor along the right true vocal fold extending into the anterior arytenoid area and extending about 1 cm below into the subglottis.  Subsequently, a decision was then made to go ahead and perform the surgical intervention.  A hemi-apron incision was employed, and 1% lidocaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine was injected.  A shoulder roll was applied after the patient was prepped and draped in a sterile fashion.  Subsequently, a hemi-apron incision was performed.  Subplatysmal flaps were raised at the hyoid bone into the clavicle.  Attention was then turned to the right side, where a level 2, 3, 4 neck dissection was performed.  Submandibular fascia was appreciated inferiorly along the submandibular gland, this was incised allowing for identification of the digastric muscle.  Digastric tunnel was performed posteriorly to the level of the sternocleidomastoid muscle.  The fascia along the sternocleidomastoid muscle was then dissected along the anterior aspect until the cranial nerve XI was identified.  Level 2A contents were then dissected off the floor of the neck including levels 3 and 4.  Preservation of the phrenic nerve was obtained by identification, and subsequently cross-clamping fibrofatty tissue and lymph nodes just adjacent to the jugular vein inferiorly at level 4.  The specimen was then mobilized over the internal jugular vein with preservation of hypoglossal nerve.  Levels 2, 3, 4 neck dissection specimens were then labeled appropriately, attached with staples, and sent for histopathological evaluation.,Attention was then turned to attempting to perform a partial laryngectomy up front with a possibility of total laryngectomy as discussed.  Subsequently, the strap muscles were separated in the midline.  The trachea was identified in the midline.  The thyroid isthmus was plicated using the Harmonic scalpel, and attention was then turned to transecting the strap muscles at the superior aspect of the thyroid cartilage.  Once this was performed, sinuses were mobilized from the thyroid cartilage both on the right and left side respectively.  The cricothyroid joint was then freed on the left side and then on the right side with noting on the right side that this cartilage was a bit more irregular.  Attention was then turned to performing a cricothyrotomy.  Upon performing this, it was obvious that there was tumor just above the level of the cricothyrotomy incision.  A #7 anode tube was then placed in this area and secured.  Attention was then turned to performing the laryngotomy at the level of the petiole of epiglottis.  Subsequently, the cuts were made on the left side with visualization of the vocalis process and coming down to the level of the cricoid cartilage, and the thyroid cartilage was then intentionally fractured along the anterior spine.  It was evident that this tumor had extended more than 1 cm into the subglottic region.  Careful dissection of larynx from an inferior margin and portion of cricoid cartilage resection then was performed posteriorly, though it was evident that the cricoid cartilage was invaded.  Frozen section biopsy then confirmed this finding as read by Dr. X of Surgical Pathology.,In light of this finding with cartilaginous invasion and inability to preserve the cricoid cartilage, the patient's case was then converted into a total laryngectomy.  Subsequently, the trachea was transected at the level 3, 4 tracheal ring into cartilaginous space and anterior tracheal stoma was fashioned using 3-0 vertical mattress sutures for the skin.  A W-plasty was also performed to allow for enlargement of the stoma.  Attention was then turned to identifying the common parting wall of the trachea and the esophagus.  Attention was then turned to resecting the hyoid bone.  The remainder of the specimen cuts were made superior from sinus preserving a modest amount of pharyngeal mechanism.  The wound was copiously irrigated.  Subsequently, a tracheoesophageal puncture site was performed using a right-angled hemostat at about approximately 1 cm from the posterior tracheal wall superior aspect.  Once this was performed, a running 3-0 canal stitch was used to close the pharynx.  Subsequently, interrupted 4-0 chromic stitches were then used as reinforcement line from superior to inferior, and fibrin glue was applied.  Two #10 JP drains were placed on the right side and one on the left side and secured appropriately with 3-0 nylon.  The wound was then closed using interrupted 3-0 Vicryl for the platysma and staples for the skin.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and was brought to the Weinberg Intensive Care Unit with the endotracheal tube still in place to be decannulated later.\",\n",

His condition is felt to be critical.  In a desperate attempt to relieve increased intracranial pressure, we have proposed placing a ventriculostomy.  I have discussed this with patient's wife who agrees and asked that we proceed emergently.,After a sterile prep, drape, and shaving of the hair over the left frontal area, this area is infiltrated with local anesthetic.  Subsequently a 1 cm incision was made over Kocher's point.  Hemostasis was obtained.  Then a twist drill was made over this area.  Bones strips were irrigated away.  The dura was perforated with a spinal needle.,A Camino monitor was connected and zeroed.  This was then passed into the left lateral ventricle on the first pass.  Excellent aggressive very bloody CSF under pressure was noted.  This stopped, slowed, and some clots were noted.  This was irrigated and then CSF continued.  Initial opening pressures were 30, but soon arose to 80 or a 100.,The patient tolerated the procedure well.  The wound was stitched shut and the ventricular drain was then connected to a drainage bag.,Platelets and FFP as well as vitamin K have been administered and ordered simultaneously with the placement of this device to help prevent further clotting or bleeding.\",\n",

There is a small subacromial spur noted on the very anterolateral border of the acromion.,HISTORY: , This is a 62-year-old female who previously underwent a repair of rotator cuff.  She continued to have pain within the shoulder.  She had a repeat MRI performed, which confirmed the clinical diagnosis of re-tear of the rotator cuff.  She wished to proceed with a repair.  All risks and benefits of the surgery were discussed with her at length.  She was in agreement with the above treatment plan.,PROCEDURE: , On 08/21/03, she was taken to the Operative Room at ABCD General Hospital.  She was placed supine on the operating table.  General anesthesia was applied by the Anesthesiology Department.  She was placed in the modified beachchair position.  Her upper extremity was sterilely prepped and draped in usual fashion.  A stab incision was made in the posterior aspect of the glenohumeral joint.  A camera was placed in the joint and was insufflated with saline solution.  Intraoperative pictures were obtained and the above findings were noted.  A second port site was initiated anteriorly.  Through this a probe was placed and the intraarticular structures were palpated and found to be intact.  A tear of the inner surface of the rotator cuff was identified.  The camera was then taken to the subacromial space.  A straight lateral portal was also used and a shaver was placed into the subacromial space.  Further debridement of the anterolateral border of the acromion was performed to remove evidence of the subacromial spur, which had reformed.  The edges of the rotator cuff were then debrided.  The camera was then removed and the shoulder was suction and dried.  A lateral incision was made over the anterolateral border of the acromion.  Subcuticular tissues were carefully dissected.  Hemostasis was controlled with electrocautery.  The deltoid musculature was then incised and aligned with its fibers exposing the rotator cuff tear and the edges were further debrided using a rongeur.  A trough was then made in the greater tuberosity using the rongeur.  Two Panalok anchors were then placed within the trough and weaved through the suture and third Panalok anchor was placed medial to the trough and weaved through the rotator cuff.  The ends of the suture were tied down from the fixating the rotator cuff within the trough.  The rotator cuff was then further oversewed using the Panalok suture.  The wound was then copiously irrigated and it was then suction dried.  The deltoid muscle was reapproximated using #1 Vicryl.  A continuous infusion pump catheter was placed into the subacromial space to help with postoperative pain control.  The subcutaneous tissues were reapproximated with #2-0 Vicryl.  The skin was closed with #4-0 PDS running subcuticular stitch.  Sterile dressing was applied to the upper extremity.  She was then placed in a shoulder immobilizer.

The McIvor mouth gag was carefully positioned into the patient's mouth with attention to avoid the teeth.,The retractor was then opened and the oropharynx was visualized.  The adenoid pad was then visualized with a laryngeal mirror.  The adenoids appeared to be 1+ and non-obstructing.  There was no evidence of submucosal cleft palate palpable.  There was no evidence of bifid uvula.  A curved Allis clamp was then used to grasp the superior pole of the right tonsil.  The tonsil was then retracted inferiorly and medially.  Bovie cautery was used to make an incision on the mucosa of the right anterior tonsillar pillar to find the appropriate plane of dissection.  The tonsil was then dissected out within this plane using a Bovie.  Tonsillar sponge was re-applied to the tonsillar fossa.  Suction cautery was then used to adequately obtain hemostasis with the tonsillar fossa.  Attention was then directed to the left tonsil.  The curved Allis was used to grasp the superior pole of the left tonsil and it was retracted inferiorly and medially.  Bovie cautery was used to make an incision in the mucosa of the left anterior tonsillar pillar and define the appropriate plane of dissection.  The tonsil was then dissected out within this plane using the Bovie.  Next, complete hemostasis was achieved within the tonsillar fossae using suction cautery.  After adequate hemostasis was obtained, attention was directed towards the adenoid pad.  The adenoid pad was again visualized and appeared 1+ and was non-obstructing.  Decision was made to use suction cautery to cauterize the adenoids.  Using a laryngeal mirror under direct visualization, the adenoid pad was then cauterized with care to avoid the eustachian tube orifices as well as the soft palate and inferior turbinates.  After cauterization was complete, the nasopharynx was again visualized and tonsillar sponge was applied.  Adequate hemostasis was achieved.  The tonsillar fossae were again visualized and no evidence of bleeding was evident.  The throat pack was removed from the oropharynx and the oropharynx was suctioned.  There was no evidence of any further bleeding.  A flexible suction catheter was then used to suction out the nasopharynx to the oropharynx.  The suction catheter was also used to suction up the stomach.

The patient’s past history is notable for a history of coronary artery disease with prior myocardial infarctions in 1995 and 1999. The patient has recently been admitted to the hospital with pneumonia and respiratory failure. The patient has been smoking up until three to four months previously. On the day of admission, the patient had the sudden onset of severe dyspnea and called an ambulance. The patient denied any gradual increase in wheezing, any increase in cough, any increase in chest pain, any increase in sputum prior to the onset of his sudden dyspnea.,ADMISSION PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,GENERAL: Showed a well-developed, slightly obese man who was in extremis.,NECK: Supple, with no jugular venous distension.,HEART: Showed tachycardia without murmurs or gallops.,PULMONARY: Status showed decreased breath sounds, but no clear-cut rales or wheezes.,EXTREMITIES: Free of edema.,HOSPITAL COURSE:,  The patient was admitted to the Special Care Unit and intubated. He received intravenous antibiotic therapy with Levaquin. He received intravenous diuretic therapy. He received hand-held bronchodilator therapy. The patient also was given intravenous steroid therapy with Solu-Medrol. The patient’s course was one of gradual improvement, and after approximately three days, the patient was extubated. He continued to be quite dyspneic, with wheezes as well as basilar rales. After pulmonary consultation was obtained, the pulmonary consultant felt that the patient’s overall clinical picture suggested that he had a,significant element of congestive heart failure. With this, the patient was placed on increased doses of Lisinopril and Digoxin, with improvement of his respiratory status. On the day of discharge, the patient had minimal basilar rales; his chest also showed minimal expiratory wheezes; he had no edema; his heart rate was regular; his abdomen was soft; and his neck veins were not distended. It was, therefore, felt that the patient was stable for further management on an outpatient basis.,DIAGNOSTIC DATA:,  The patient’s admission laboratory data was notable for his initial blood gas, which showed a pH of 7.02 with a pCO2 of 118 and a pO2 of 103. The patient’s electrocardiogram showed nonspecific ST-T wave changes. The patent’s CBC showed a white count of 24,000, with 56% neutrophils and 3% bands.,DISPOSITION:,  The patient was discharged home.,DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:,  His diet was to be a 2 grams sodium, 1800 calorie ADA diet.

       " 'PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Large and invasive recurrent pituitary adenoma.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Large and invasive recurrent pituitary adenoma.,OPERATION PERFORMED: , Endoscopic-assisted transsphenoidal exploration and radical excision of pituitary adenoma, endoscopic exposure of sphenoid sinus with removal of tissue from within the sinus, harvesting of dermal fascia abdominal fat graft, placement of abdominal fat graft into sella turcica, reconstruction of sellar floor using autologous nasal bone creating a cranioplasty of less than 5 cm, repair of nasal septal deviation, using the operating microscope and microdissection technique, and placement of lumbar subarachnoid catheter connected to reservoir for aspiration and infusion.,INDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURE: , This man has undergone one craniotomy and 2 previous transsphenoidal resections of his tumor, which is known to be an invasive pituitary adenoma.  He did not return for followup or radiotherapy as instructed, and the tumor has regrown.  For this reason, he is admitted for transsphenoidal reoperation with an attempt to remove as much tumor as possible.  The high-risk nature of the procedure and the fact that postoperative radiation is mandatory was made clear to him.  Many risks including CSF leak and blindness were discussed in detail.  After clear understanding of all the same, he elected to proceed ahead with surgery.,PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was placed on the operating table, and after adequate induction of general anesthesia, he was placed in the left lateral decubitus position.  Care was taken to pad all pressure points appropriately.  The back was prepped and draped in usual sterile manner.,A 14-gauge Tuohy needle was introduced into the lumbar subarachnoid space.  Clear and colorless CSF issued forth.  A catheter was inserted to a distance of 40 cm, and the needle was removed.  The catheter was then connected to a closed drainage system for aspiration and infusion.,This no-touch technique is now a standard of care for treatment of patients with large invasive adenomas.  Via injections through the lumbar drain, one increases intracranial pressure and produces gentle migration of the tumor.  This improves outcome and reduces complications by atraumatically dissecting the tumor away from the optic apparatus.,The patient was then placed supine, and the 3-point headrest was affixed.  He was placed in the semi-sitting position with the head turned to the right and a roll placed under the left shoulder.  Care was taken to pad all pressure points appropriately.  The fluoroscope C-arm unit was then positioned so as to afford an excellent view of the sella and sphenoid sinus in the lateral projection.  The metallic arm was then connected to the table for the use of the endoscope.  The oropharynx, nasopharynx, and abdominal areas were then prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.,A transverse incision was made in the abdominal region, and several large pieces of fat were harvested for later use.  Hemostasis was obtained.  The wound was carefully closed in layers.,I then advanced a 0-degree endoscope up the left nostril.  The middle turbinate was identified and reflected laterally exposing the sphenoid sinus ostium.  Needle Bovie electrocautery was used to clear mucosa away from the ostium.  The perpendicular plate of the ethmoid had already been separated from the sphenoid.  I entered into the sphenoid.,There was a tremendous amount of dense fibrous scar tissue present, and I slowly and carefully worked through all this.  I identified a previous sellar opening and widely opened the bone, which had largely regrown out to the cavernous sinus laterally on the left, which was very well exposed, and the cavernous sinus on the right, which I exposed the very medial portion of.  The opening was wide until I had the horizontal portion of the floor to the tuberculum sella present.,The operating microscope was then utilized.  Working under magnification, I used hypophysectomy placed in the nostril.,The dura was then carefully opened in the midline, and I immediately encountered tissue consistent with pituitary adenoma.  A frozen section was obtained, which confirmed this diagnosis without malignant features.,Slowly and meticulously, I worked to remove the tumor.  I used the suction apparatus as well as the bipolar coagulating forceps and ring and cup curette to begin to dissect tumor free.  The tumor was moderately vascular and very fibrotic.,Slowly and carefully, I systematically entered the sellar contents until I could see the cavernous sinus wall on the left and on the right.  There appeared to be cavernous sinus invasion on the left.  It was consistent with what we saw on the MRI imaging.,The portion working into the suprasellar cistern was slowly dissected down by injecting saline into the lumbar subarachnoid catheter.  A large amount of this was removed.  There was a CSF leak, as the tumor was removed for the upper surface of it was very adherent to the arachnoid and could not be separated free.,Under high magnification, I actually worked up into this cavity and performed a very radical excision of tumor.  While there may be a small amount of tumor remaining, it appeared that a radical excision had been created with decompression of the optic apparatus.  In fact, I reinserted the endoscope and could see the optic chiasm well.,I reasoned that I had therefore achieved the goal with that is of a radical excision and decompression.  Attention was therefore turned to closure.,The wound was copiously irrigated with Bacitracin solution, and meticulous hemostasis was obtained.  I asked Anesthesiology to perform a Valsalva maneuver, and there was no evidence of bleeding.,Attention was turned to closure and reconstruction.  I placed a very large piece of fat in the sella to seal the leak and verified that there was no fat in the suprasellar cistern by using fluoroscopy and looking at the pattern of the air.  Using a polypropylene insert, I reconstructed the sellar floor with this implant making a nice tight sling and creating a cranioplasty of less than 5 cm.,DuraSeal was placed over this, and the sphenoid sinus was carefully packed with fat and DuraSeal.,I inspected the nasal passages and restored the septum precisely to the midline repairing a previous septal deviation.  The middle turbinates were then restored to their anatomic position.  There was no significant intranasal bleeding, and for this reason, an open nasal packing was required.  Sterile dressings were applied, and the operation was terminated.,The patient tolerated the procedure well and left to the recovery room in excellent condition.  The sponge and needle counts were reported as correct, and there were no intraoperative complications.,Specimens were sent to Pathology consisting of tumor.',\n",

Next the neck, chest and legs were prepped and draped in the standard surgical fashion.  We used a #10-blade scalpel to make a midline median sternotomy incision.  Dissection was carried down to the left of the sternum using Bovie electrocautery.  The sternum was opened with a sternal saw.  The chest retractor was positioned.  Next, full-dose heparin was given.  The pericardium was opened.  Pericardial stay sutures were positioned.  After obtaining adequate ACT, we prepared to place the patient on cardiopulmonary bypass.  A 2-0 double pursestring of Ethibond suture was placed in the ascending aorta.  Through this was passed an aortic cannula connected to the arterial side of the cardiopulmonary bypass machine.  Next a 3-0 Prolene pursestring was placed in the right atrial appendage.  Through this was passed our venous cannula connected to the venous portion of the cardiopulmonary bypass machine.  A 4-0 U-stitch was placed in the right atrium.  A retrograde cardioplegia catheter was positioned at this site.  Next, scissors were used to dissect out the right upper pulmonary vein.  A 4-0 Prolene pursestring was placed in the right upper pulmonary vein.  Next, a right-angle sump was placed at this position.  We then connected our retrograde cardioplegia catheter to the cardioplegia solution circuit.  Bovie electrocautery was used to dissect the interface between the aorta and pulmonary artery.  The aorta was completely encircled.  Next, an antegrade cardioplegia needle and associated sump were placed in the ascending aorta.  We then prepared to cross-clamp the aorta.  We went down on our flows and cross-clamped the aorta.  We backed up our flows.  We then gave antegrade and retrograde cold blood cardioplegia solution circuit so as to arrest the heart.  The patient had some aortic insufficiency so we elected, after initially arresting the heart, to open the aorta and transect it and then give direct ostial infusion of cardioplegia solution circuit.  Next, after obtaining complete diastolic arrest of the heart, we turned our attention to exposing the aortic valve, and 4-0 Tycron sutures were placed in the commissures.  In addition, a 2-0 Prolene suture was placed in the aortic wall so as to bring the aortic wall and root up into view.  Next, scissors were used to excise the diseased aortic valve leaflets.  Care was taken to remove all the calcium from the aortic annulus.  We then sized up the aortic annulus which came out to be a **-mm stentless porcine Toronto valve.  We prepared the valve.  Next, we placed our proximal suture line of interrupted 4-0 Tycron sutures for the annulus.  We started with our individual commissural stitches.  They were connected to our valve sewing ring.  Next, we placed 5 interrupted 4-0 Tycron sutures in a subannular fashion at each commissural position.  After doing so, we passed 1 end of the suture through the sewing portion of the Toronto stentless porcine valve.  The valve was lowered into place and all of the sutures were tied.  Next, we gave another round of cold blood antegrade and retrograde cardioplegia.  Next, we sewed our distal suture line.  We began with the left coronary cusp of the valve.  We ran a 5-0 RB needle up both sides of the valve.  Care was taken to avoid the left coronary ostia.  This procedure was repeated on the right cusp of the stentless porcine valve.  Again, care was taken to avoid any injury to the coronary ostia.  Lastly, we sewed our non-coronary cusp.  This was done without difficulty.  At this point we inspected our aortic valve.  There was good coaptation of the leaflets, and it was noted that both the left and the right coronary ostia were open.  We gave another round of cold blood antegrade and retrograde cardioplegia.  The antegrade portion was given in a direct ostial fashion once again.  We now turned our attention to closing the aorta.  A 4-0 Prolene double row of suture was used to close the aorta in a running fashion.  Just prior to closing, we de-aired the heart and gave a warm shot of antegrade and retrograde cardioplegia.  At this point, we removed our aortic cross-clamp.  The heart gradually regained its electromechanical activity.  We placed 2 atrial and 2 ventricular pacing wires.  We removed our aortic vent and oversewed that site with another 4-0 Prolene on an SH needle.  We removed our retrograde cardioplegia catheter.  We oversewed that site with a 5-0 Prolene.  By now, the heart was de-aired and resumed normal electromechanical activity.  We began to wean the patient from cardiopulmonary bypass.  We then removed our venous cannula and suture ligated that site with a #2 silk.  We then gave full-dose protamine.  After knowing that there was no evidence of a protamine reaction, we removed the aortic cannula.  We buttressed that site with a 4-0 Prolene on an SH needle.  We placed a mediastinal chest tube and brought it out through the skin.  We also placed 2 Blake drains, 1 in the left chest and 1 in the right chest, as the patient had some bilateral pleural effusions.  They were brought out through the skin.  The sternum was closed with #7 wires in an interrupted figure-of-eight fashion.  The fascia was closed with #1 Vicryl.  We closed the subcu tissue with 2-0 Vicryl and the skin with 4-0 PDS.',\n",

All risks and benefits of the procedure were explained and all questions were answered.  The patient was prepped and draped in the normal sterile fashion.  After landmarks were identified, approximately 5 cc of 1% lidocaine were injected into the skin and subcuticular tissues and the right neck posterior head of the sternocleidomastoid.  Locator needle was used to correctly cannulate the right internal jugular vein.  Multiple attempts were made and the right internal jugular vein was unable to be cannulized.,Therefore, we prepared for a right subclavian approach.  The angle of the clavicle was found and a #22 gauge needle was used to anesthetize approximately 5 cc of 1% lidocaine in skin and subcuticular tissues along with the periosteum of the clavicle.  A Cook catheter needle was then placed and ________ the clavicle in the orientation aimed toward the sternal notch.  The right subclavian vein was then accessed.

This was an intraarticular four-part fracture that was displaced dorsally.  In addition, the patient previously undergone a carpal tunnel release, but had symptoms of carpal tunnel preop.  She is admitted for reconstructive operation.  The symptoms of carpal tunnel were present preop and worsened after the injury.,OPERATION:,  The patient was brought from the ambulatory care unit and placed on the operating table in a supine position and administered general anesthetic by Anesthesia.  Once adequate anesthesia had been obtained, the right upper extremity was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.  Tourniquet was placed around the right upper extremity.  The upper extremity was then elevated and exsanguinated using an Esmarch dressing.  The tourniquet was elevated to 250 mmHg.  The entire operation was performed with 4.5 loop magnification.  At this time an approximately 8 cm longitudinal incision was then made overlying the right flexor carpi radialis tendon from the flexion crease to the wrist proximally.  This was carried down to the flexor carpi radialis, which was then retracted ulnarly.  The floor of the flexor carpi radialis was then incised exposing the flexor pronator muscles.  The flexor pollicis longus was retracted ulnarly and the pronator quadratus was longitudinally incised 1 cm from its origin.  It was then elevated off of the fracture site exposing the fracture site, which was dorsally displaced.  This was an intraarticular four-part fracture.  Under image control, the two volar pieces and dorsal pieces were then carefully manipulated and reduced.  Then, 2.06 two-inch K-wires were drilled radial into the volar ulnar fragment and then a second K-wire was then drilled from the dorsal radial to the dorsal ulnar piece.  A third K-wire was then drilled from the volar radial to the dorsal ulnar piece.  The fracture was then manipulated.  The fracture ends were copiously irrigated with normal saline and curetted and then the fracture was reduced in the usual fashion by recreating the defect and distracting it.  Further K-wires were then placed through the radial styloid into the proximal fragment.  A Hand Innovations DVR plate of regular size for the right wrist was then fashioned over and placed over the distal radius and secured with two K-wires.  At this time, the distal screws were then placed.  The distal screws were the small screws.  These were non-locking screws, all eight screws were placed.  They were placed in the usual fashion by drilling with a small drill bit removing the small introducers and then using its depth.  Again, these were 18-20 mm screws.  After placing three of the screws it was necessary to remove the K-wires.  There was excellent reduction of the fragments and the fracture; excellent reduction of the intraarticular component and the fracture.  After the distal screws were placed, the fracture was reduced and held in place with K-wires, which were replaced and the proximal screws were drilled with the drill guide and the larger drill bit.  The screws were then placed.  These were 12 mm screws.  They were placed 4 in number.  The K-wires were then removed.  Finally, a 3 cm intrathenar incision was made beginning 1 cm distal to the flexor crease of the wrist.  This was carried down to the transverse carpal ligament, which was divided throughout the length of the incision, upon entering the carpal canal, the median nerve was found to be adherent to the undersurface of the structure.  It was dissected free from the structure out to its trifurcation.  The motor branches seen entering the thenar fascia and obstructed.  The nerve was then retracted dorsally and the patient had a great deal of scar tissue in the area of the volar flexion crease to the wrist where she had a previous incision that extended from the volar flexion crease of the wrist overlying the palmaris longus proximally for 1 cm.  In this area, careful dissection was performed in order to move the nerve from the surrounding structures and the most proximal aspect of the transverse carpal ligament, the more proximally located volar carpal ligament was then divided 5 cm into the distal forearm on the ulnar side of the palmaris longus tendon.  Incisions were then copiously irrigated with normal saline.  Homeostasis was maintained with electrocautery.  The pronator quadratus was closed with 3-0 Vicryl and the above skin incisions were closed proximally with 4-0 nylon and palmar incision with 5-0 nylon in the horizontal mattress fashion.  A large bulky dressing was then applied with a volar short-arm splint maintaining the wrist in neutral position.  The tourniquet was let down.  The fingers were immediately pink.

The retroperitoneal space was entered and bluntly dissected free to the psoas, bringing all the peritoneal contents to the midline, exposing the aorta.  The inferior pulmonary ligament was then taken down so the aorta could be dissected free at the T10 level just above the diaphragm.  It was dissected free circumferentially.  The aortic bifurcation was dissected free, dissecting free both iliac arteries.  The left inferior pulmonary vein was then dissected free, and a pursestring of 4-0 Prolene was placed on this.  The patient was heparinized.  Through a stab wound in the center of this, a right-angle venous cannula was then placed at the left atrium and secured to a Rumel tourniquet.  This was hooked to a venous inflow of left heart bypass machine.  A pursestring of 4-0 Prolene was placed on the aneurysm and through a stab wound in the center of this, an arterial cannula was placed and hooked to outflow.  Bypass was instituted.  The aneurysm was cross clamped just above T10 and also, cross clamped just below the diaphragm.  The area was divided at this point.  A 26-mm graft was then sutured in place with running 3-0 Prolene suture.  The graft was brought into the diaphragm.  Clamps were then placed on the iliacs, and the pump was shut off.  The aorta was opened longitudinally, going posterior between the left and right renal arteries, and it was completely transected at its bifurcation.  The SMA, celiac and right renal artery were then dissected free as a complete island, and the left renal was dissected free as a complete Carrell patch.  The island was laid in the graft for the visceral liner, and it was sutured in place with running 4-0 Prolene suture with pledgetted 4-0 Prolene sutures around the circumference.  The clamp was then moved below the visceral vessels, and the clamp on the chest was removed, re-establishing flow to the visceral vessels.  The graft was cut to fit the bifurcation and sutured in place with running 3-0 Prolene suture.  All clamps were removed, and flow was re-established.  An 8-mm graft was sutured end-to-end to the Carrell patch and to the left renal.  A partial-occlusion clamp was placed.  An area of graft was removed.  The end of the graft was cut to fit this and sutured in place with running Prolene suture.  The partial-occlusion clamp was removed.  Protamine was given.  Good hemostasis was noted.  The arterial cannula, of course, had been removed when that part of the aneurysm was removed.  The venous cannula was removed and oversewn with a 4-0 Prolene suture.  Good hemostasis was noted.  A 36 French posterior and a 32 French anterior chest tube were placed.  The ribs were closed with figure-of-eight #2 Vicryl.  The fascial layer was closed with running #1 Prolene, subcu with running 2-0 Dexon and the skin with running 4-0 Dexon subcuticular stitch.  Patient tolerated the procedure well.',\n",

The laryngeal monitoring was noted to be working fine.  Then, an incision was made in this area in a curvilinear fashion through the old scar, taken through the fat and the platysma level.  The strap muscles were found and there was scar tissue along the trachea and the strap muscles were elevated off of the left thyroid, the thyroid gland was then found.  Then, using bipolar cautery and a Coblation dissector, the thyroid gland inferiorly was dissected off and the parathyroid gland was left inferiorly and there was scar tissue that was released and laterally, the thyroid gland was released, then came into the Berry ligaments.  The Berry ligament was dissected off and the gland came off all the way to the superior and inferior thyroid vessels, which were crossed with the Harmonic scalpel and removed.  No bleeding was seen.  There was a small nick in the external jugular vein that was tied with a 4-0 Vicryl suture ligature.  After this was completed, on examining the specimen, there appeared to be a lobule on it and it was sent off as possibly parathyroid, therefore it was reimplanted in the left lower sternocleidomastoid region using the silk suture ligature.

He has esophageal rupture on CT scan and comes now for a thoracotomy and gastrostomy.,DETAILS OF THE PROCEDURE: , After an extensive informed consent discussion process, the patient was brought to the operating room.  He was placed in a supine position on the operating table.  After induction of general anesthesia and placement of a double lumen endotracheal tube, he was turned and placed in a right lateral decubitus position on a beanbag with appropriate padding and axillary roll.  Left chest was prepped and draped in a usual sterile fashion.  After administration of intravenous antibiotics, a left thoracotomy incision was made, dissection was carried down to the subcutaneous tissues, muscle layers down to the fifth interspace.  The left lung was deflated and the pleural cavity entered.  The Finochietto retractor was used to help provide exposure.  The sixth rib was shingled in the posterior position and a careful expiration of the left pleural cavity was performed.,Immediately encountered was left pleural fluid including some purulent fluid.  Cultures of this were sampled and sent for microbiology analysis.  The left pleural space was then copiously irrigated.  A careful expiration demonstrated that the rupture appeared to be sealed.  There was crepitus within the mediastinal cavity.  The mediastinum was opened and explored and the esophagus was explored.  The tissues of the esophagus appeared to show some friability and an area of the rupture in the distal esophagus.  It was not possible to place any stitches in this tissue and instead a small intercostal flap was developed and placed to cover the area.  The area was copiously irrigated, this provided nice coverage and repair.  After final irrigation and inspection, two chest tubes were placed including a #36 French right angled tube at the diaphragm and a posterior straight #36 French.  These were secured at the left axillary line region at the skin level with #0-silk.,The intercostal sutures were used to close the chest wall with a #2 Vicryl sutures.  Muscle layers were closed with running #1 Vicryl sutures.  The wound was irrigated and the skin was closed with skin staples.,The patient was then turned and placed in a supine position.  A laparoscopic gastrostomy was performed and then a diagnostic laparoscopy performed.  A Veress needle was carefully inserted into the abdomen, pneumoperitoneum was established in the usual fashion, a bladeless 5-mm separator trocar was introduced.  The laparoscope was introduced.  A single additional left-sided separator trocar was introduced.  It was not possible to safely pass a nasogastric or orogastric tube, pass the stricture and perforation and so the nasogastric tube was left right at the level where there was some stricture or narrowing or resistance.  The stomach however did have some air insufflation and we were able to place our T-fasteners through the anterior abdominal wall and through the anterior gastric wall safely.  The skin incision was made and the gastric lumen was then accessed with the Seldinger technique.  Guide wire was introduced into the stomach lumen and series of dilators was then passed over the guide wire.  #18 French Gastrostomy was then passed into the stomach lumen and the balloon was inflated.  We confirmed that we were in the gastric lumen and the balloon was pulled up, creating apposition of the gastric wall and the anterior abdominal wall.

The area of the right coronary artery was anesthetized with 2% lidocaine and a 4-French sheath was placed.  Conscious sedation was obtained using a combination of Versed 1 mg and fentanyl 50 mcg.  A left #4, 4-French, Judkins catheter was placed and advanced through the ostium of the left main coronary artery.  Because of difficulty positioning the catheter, the catheter was removed and a 6-French sheath was placed and a 6-French #4 left Judkins catheter was placed.  This was advanced through the ostium of the left main coronary artery where selective angiograms were performed.  Following this, the 4-French right Judkins catheter was placed and angiograms of the right coronary were performed.  A pigtail catheter was placed and a left heart catheterization was performed, followed by a left ventriculogram.  The left heart pullback was performed.  The catheter was removed and a small injection of contrast was given to the sheath.  The sheath was removed over a wire and an Angio-Seal was placed.  There were no complications.  Total contrast media was 200 mL of Optiray 350.  Fluoroscopy time 5.3 minutes.  Total x-ray dose is 1783 mGy.,HEMODYNAMICS:  ,Rhythm is sinus throughout the procedure.  LV pressure of 155/22 mmHg, aortic pressure of 160/80 mmHg.  LV pullback demonstrates no gradient.,The right coronary artery is a nondominant vessel and free of disease.  This also gives rise to the conus branch and two RV free wall branches.  The left main has minor plaquing in the inferior aspect measuring no more than 10% to 15%.  This vessel then bifurcates into the LAD and circumflex.  The circumflex is a large caliber vessel and is dominant.  This vessel gives rise to a large first marginal artery, a moderate sized second marginal branch, and additionally gives rise to a large third marginal artery and the PDA.  There was a very eccentric and severe stenosis in the proximal circumflex measuring approximately 90% in severity.  The origin of the first marginal artery has a severe stenosis measuring approximately 90% in severity.  The distal circumflex has a 60% lesion just prior to the origin of the third marginal branch and PDA.,The proximal LAD is ectatic.  The LAD gives rise to a large first diagonal artery that has a 90% lesion in its origin and a subtotal occlusion midway down the diagonal.  Distal to the origin of this diagonal branch, there is another area of ectasia in the LAD, followed by an area of stenosis that in some views is approximately 50% in severity.,The left ventriculogram demonstrates hypokinesis of the distal half of the inferior wall.

The patient has failed attempts at conservative treatment and is unable to wear shoes without pain to his second toe.  The patient presents n.p.o. since mid night last night and consented to sign in the chart.  H&P is complete.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:,  After an IV was instituted by the Department of Anesthesia in the preoperative holding area, the patient was escorted to the operating room and placed on the table in the supine position.  Using Webril, the distal leg and ankle was padded and a ankle pneumatic tourniquet was placed around the right ankle, but left deflated at this time.  Restraining, a lap belt was then placed around the patient's abdomen while laying on the table.  After adequate anesthesia was administered by the Department of Anesthesia, a local digital block using 5 cc of 0.5% Marcaine plain was used to provide local anesthesia.  The foot was then prepped and draped in the normal sterile orthopedic manner.  The foot was then elevated and Esmarch bandage was applied, after which time the tourniquet was inflated to 250 mmHg.  The foot was then brought down to the level of the table and stockinet was cut and reflected after the Esmarch bandage was removed.  A wet and dry sponge was then used to cleanse the operative site and using a skin skribe a dorsal incisional line was outlined extending from the proximal phalanx over the proximal interphalangeal joint on to the middle phalanx.,Then using a fresh #15 blade, a dorsolinear incision was made, partial thickness through the skin after testing anesthesia with one to two pickup.  Then using a fresh #15 blade, incision was deepened and using medial to lateral pressure, the incision was opened into the subcutaneous tissue.  Care was taken to reflect the subcutaneous tissue from the underlying deep fascia to mobilize the skin.  This was performed with the combination of blunt and dull dissection.  Care was taken to avoid proper digital arteries and neurovascular bundles as were identified.  Attention was then directed to the proximal interphalangeal joint and after identifying the joint line, a transverse linear incision was made over the dorsal surface of the joint.  The medial and lateral sides of the joint capsule were then also incised on the superior half in order to provide increased exposure.  Following this, the proximal portion of the transected extensor digitorum longus tendon was identified using an Adson-Brown pickup.  It was elevated with fresh #15 blade.  The tendon and capsule was reflected along with the periosteum from the underlying bone dorsally.  Following this, the distal portion of the tendon was identified in a like manner.  The tendon and the capsule as well as the periosteal tissue was reflected from the dorsal surface of the bone.  The proximal interphalangeal joint was then distracted and using careful technique, #15 blade was used to deepen the incision and while maintaining close proximity to the bone and condyles, the lateral and medial collateral ligaments were freed up from the side of the proximal phalanx head.,Following this, the head of the proximal phalanx was known to have adequate exposure and was freed from soft tissues.  Then using a sagittal saw with a #139 blade, the head of he proximal phalanx was resected.  Care was taken to avoid the deep flexor tendon.  The head of the proximal phalanx was taken with the Adson-Brown and using a #15 blade, the plantar periosteal tissue was freed up and the head was removed and sent to pathology.  The wound was then flushed using a sterile saline with gentamicin and the digit was noted to be in good alignment.  The digit was also noted to be in rectus alignment.  Proximal portion of the tendon was shortened to allow for removal of the redundant tendon after correction of the deformity.  Then using a #3-0 Vicryl suture, three simple interrupted sutures were placed for closure of the tendon and capsular tissue.  Then following this, #4-0 nylon was used in a combination of horizontal mattress and simple interrupted sutures to close the skin.  The toe was noted to be in good alignment and then 1 cc of dexamethasone phosphate was injected into the incision site.  Following this, the incision was dressed using a sterile Owen silk soaked in saline and gentamicin.  The toe was bandaged using 4 x 4s, Kling, and Coban.  The tourniquet was deflated and immediate hyperemia was noted to the digits I through V of the right foot.,The patient was then transferred to the cart and was escorted to the Postanesthesia Care Unit where the patient was given postoperative surgical shoe.  Total tourniquet time for the case was 30 minutes.  While in the recovery, the patient was given postoperative instructions to include, ice and elevation to his right foot.  The patient was given pain medications of Tylenol #3, quantity 30 to be taken one to two tablets every six to eight hours as necessary for moderate to severe pain.  The patient was also given prescription for cane to aid in ambulation.  The patient will followup with Dr. X on Tuesday in his office for postoperative care.

The patient was placed on the operative table in supine position.  After this, the patient was placed under general endotracheal intubation anesthesia and the patient was then placed upon a shoulder roll.  After this, the skin incision was marked approximately two fingerbreadths above the sternal notch.  It was then localized with 1% lidocaine with epinephrine 1:1000 approximately 7 cc total.,After this, the patient was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion and a #10 blade was then utilized to make a skin incision.  The subcutaneous tissue was then bluntly dissected utilizing a Ray-Tec sponge and a bear claw was then utilized to retract the upper incisional skin with counter retraction performed to allow a subplatysmal plane of skin flaps to be performed in superior and inferolateral directions.  After this, the midline was then identified and grasped on either side with a DeBakey forceps.  The raphe was noted and Bovie cauterization was utilized to cut down into this region.  The fine stats were utilized to further open this area with exposure and bisection of the sternothyroid muscle.  It was separated on the left side from the patient's sternothyroid muscle.  After this, the sternothyroid muscle was identified, grasped with the DeBakey forceps and infiltrated initially through its fascial plane with the Metzenbaum scissors.  Blunt dissection was then utilized to free the sternothyroid muscle from the thyroid gland in superior and inferior directions and laterally with the help of Kitners.  After this, the plane was rotated more anteriorly with the superior and inferior parathyroid glands identified.  The fat cap was noted to be attached on the superior parathyroid to the posterior aspect of the thyroid itself.  It was freed from the thyroid gland and reflected laterally and posteriorly.  The inferior parathyroid gland actually appeared to be attached also to the inferior aspect of the thyroid itself and was reflected laterally.  After this, the patient's thyroid gland was palpated noting a thyroid nodule in the posterior inferior aspect along with the calcification laterally.  The nodule appeared to be sort of rubbery in consistency and approximately 1 cm diameter.  As the gland was rotated more anteriorly, the recurrent laryngeal nerve on the left side was identified and further dissection along Berry's ligament on the medial aspect was performed.  The middle thyroid vein and inferior thyroid artery were both cauterized with a bipolar cautery and bisected.  After this, the gland was easily rotated anteriorly with further dissection carried up to the superior pole.  The superior pole was exposed with the help of a Richardson and Army-Navy retractors with cross-clamping and tying of the superior laryngeal artery and vein.  Further, the small bleeding vessels were identified and bipolared, and cut with the Metzenbaum scissors.  The superior pole was finally freed and the gland was rotated more anteriorly onto the anterior aspect of the trachea.  Berry's ligament was finally freed and the gland was cross-clamped on the opposing thyroid isthmus with a mosquito.  After this, the gland was cut with a Metzenbaum scissors and tied with a #3-0 undyed Vicryl tie.  The defect on the neck now was thoroughly irrigated with normal saline solution and further bleeding was controlled with bipolar cauterization.  Surgicel was then cut in small strips and three replaced in the lateral part of the neck.,The opposing side of the thyroid gland on the right was palpated with no noticeable nodules or masses.  The strap muscles were then reapproximated with #3-0 Vicryl on a SH, followed by reapproximation of the subcutaneous tissue with #4-0 Vicryl, followed by reapproximation of the skin by running subcuticular #5-0 Prolene and a #6-0 fast absorbing gut.  Mastisol, Steri-Strips, and bacitracin were placed followed by a sterile 4 x 4 dressing.  The patient was then turned back to Anesthesia, extubated in the operating room, and transferred to Recovery in stable condition.

       " 'PROCEDURE PERFORMED:,1.  Left heart catheterization, left ventriculogram, aortogram, coronary angiogram.,2.  PCI of the LAD and left main coronary artery with Impella assist device.,INDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURE: , Unstable angina and congestive heart failure with impaired LV function.,TECHNIQUE OF PROCEDURE: , After obtaining informed consent, the patient was brought to the cardiac catheterization suite in postabsorptive and nonsedated state.  The right groin was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.  Lidocaine 2% was used for infiltration anesthesia.  Using modified Seldinger technique, a 7-French sheath was introduced into the right common femoral artery and a 6-French sheath was introduced into the right common femoral vein.  Through the arterial sheath, angiography of the right common femoral artery was obtained.  Thereafter, 6-French pigtail catheter was advanced to the level of the distal aorta where angiography of the distal aorta and the bifurcation of the right and left common iliac arteries was obtained.  Thereafter, a 4-French sheath was introduced into the left common femoral artery using modified Seldinger technique.  Thereafter, the pigtail catheter was advanced over an 0.035-inch J-wire into the left ventricle and LV-gram was performed in RAO view and after pullback, an aortogram was performed in the LAO view.  Therefore, a 6-French JL4 and JR4 guiding catheters were used to engage the left and right coronary arteries respectively and multiple orthogonal views of the coronary arteries were obtained.,ANGIOGRAPHIC FINDINGS:  ,1.  LV-gram:  LVEDP was 15 mmHg.  LV ejection fraction 10% to 15% with global hypokinesis.  Only anterior wall is contracting.  There was no mitral regurgitation.  There was no gradient across the aortic valve upon pullback, and on aortography, there was no evidence of aortic dissection or aortic regurgitation.,2.  The right coronary artery is a dominant vessels with a mid 50% to 70% stenosis which was not treated.  The left main coronary artery calcified vessel with disease.,2.  The left anterior descending artery had an 80% to 90% mid-stenosis.  First diagonal branch had a more than 90% stenosis.,3.  The circumflex coronary artery had a patent stent.,INTERVENTION: , After reviewing the angiographic images, we elected to proceed with intervention of the left anterior descending artery.  The 4-French sheath in the left common femoral artery was upsized to a 12-French Impella sheath through which an Amplatz wire and a 6-French multipurpose catheter were advanced into the left ventricle.  The Amplatz wire was exchanged for an Impella 0.018-inch stiff wire.  The multipurpose catheter was removed, and the Impella was advanced into the left ventricle and a performance level of 8 was achieved with a cardiac output of 2 to 2.5 l/min.  Thereafter, a 7-French JL4 guiding catheter was used to engage the left coronary artery and an Asahi soft 0.014-inch wire was advanced into the left anterior descending artery and a second 0.014-inch Asahi soft wire was advanced into the diagonal branch.  The diagonal branch was predilated with a 2.5 x 30-mm Sprinter balloon at nominal atmospheres and thereafter a 2.5 x 24 Endeavor stent was successfully deployed in the mid-LAD and a 3.0 x 15-mm Endeavor stent was deployed in the proximal LAD.  The stent delivery balloon was used to post-dilate the overlapping segment.  The LAD, the diagonal was rewires with an 0.014-inch Asahi soft wire and a 3.0 x 20-mm Maverick balloon was advanced into the LAD for post-dilatation and a 2.0 x 30-mm Sprinter balloon was advanced into the diagonal for kissing inflations which were performed at nominal atmospheres.  At this point, it was noted that the left main had a retrograde dissection.  A 3.5 x 18-mm Endeavor stent was successfully deployed in the left main coronary artery.  The Asahi soft wire in the diagonal was removed and placed into the circumflex coronary artery.  Kissing inflations of the LAD and the circumflex coronary artery were performed using 3.0 x 20 Maverick balloons x2 balloons, inflated at high atmospheres of 14.,RESULTS: , Lesion reduction in the LAD FROM 90% to 0% and TIMI 3 flow obtained.  Lesion reduction in the diagonal from 90% to less than 60% and TIMI 3 flow obtained.  Lesion reduction in the left maintained coronary artery from 50% to 0% and TIMI 3 flow obtained.,The patient tolerated the procedure well and the inflations well with no evidence of any hemodynamic instability.  The Impella device was gradually decreased from performance level of 8 to performance level of 1 at which point it was removed into the aorta and it was turned off and the Impella was removed from the body and the 2 Perclose sutures were tightened.  From the right common femoral artery, a 6-French IMA catheter was advanced and an 0.035-inch wire down into the left common femoral and superficial femoral artery, over which an 8 x 40 balloon was advanced and tamponade of the arteriotomy site of the left common femoral artery was performed from within the artery at 3 atmospheres for a total of 20 minutes.  The right common femoral artery and vein sheaths were both sutured in place for further observation.  Of note, the patient received Angiomax during the procedure and an ACT above 300 was maintained.,IMPRESSION:,1.  Left ventricular dysfunction with ejection fraction of 10% to 15%.,2.  High complex percutaneous coronary intervention of the left main coronary artery, left anterior descending artery, and diagonal with Impella circulatory support.,COMPLICATIONS: , None.,The patient tolerated the procedure well with no complications.  The estimated blood loss was 200 ml.  Estimated dye used was 200 ml of Visipaque.  The patient remained hemodynamically stable with no hypotension and no hematomas in the groins.,PLAN:  ,1.  Aspirin, Plavix, statins, beta blockers, ACE inhibitors as tolerated.,2.  Hydration.,3.  The patient will be observed over night for any hemodynamic instability or ischemia.

The patella was noted to be situated laterally past the lateral femoral condyle.  There was a tear to the posterior horn of the medial meniscus within the white zone.  There was a complex tear involving a horizontal cleavage component to the posterior horn of the lateral meniscus as well in the entire meniscus.  There was a complete tear of the anterior cruciate ligament.  The posterior cruciate ligament appeared intact.  Preoperatively, she had a positive Lachman with a positive pivot shift test as well as increased patellofemoral instability.,HISTORY: , This is a 39-year-old female who has sustained a twisting injury to her knee while on trampoline in late August.  She was diagnosed per MRI.  An MRI confirmed the clinical diagnosis of anterior cruciate ligament tear.  She states she has had multiple episodes of instability to the patellofemoral joint throughout the years with multiple dislocations.  She elected to proceed with surgery to repair the anterior cruciate ligament as well as possibly plicate the medial retinaculum to help prevent further dislocations of the patellofemoral joint.  All risks and benefits of surgery were discussed with her at length.  She was in agreement with the treatment plan.,PROCEDURE:  ,On 09/11/03, she was taken to the operating room at ABCD General Hospital.  She was placed supine on the operating table.  General anesthetic was applied by the Anesthesiology Department.  Tourniquet was placed on the proximal thigh and it was then placed in a knee holder.  She was sterilely prepped and draped in the usual fashion.  An Esmarch was used to exsanguinate the lower extremity.  Tourniquet was inflated to 325 mmHg.  Longitudinal incision was made just medial to the tibial tubercle.  The subcutaneous tissue was carefully dissected.  Hemostasis was controlled with electrocautery.  The tendons of gracilis and semitendinosus were identified and isolated, and then stripped off the musculotendinous junction.  They were taken on the back table.  The soft tissue debris was removed from the tendons.  The ends of the tendons were sewn together using #5 Tycron whip type sutures.  The tendons were measured on back table and found to be 8 mm as the most adequate size, they were then placed under tension on the back table.  Stab incision was made in the inferolateral parapatellar region, through this camera was placed in the knee.  The knee was inflated with saline solution and operative pictures were obtained.  The above findings were noted.  A second port site was initiated in the inferomedial parapatellar region.  Through this, a probe was placed.  Tear in the posterior horn medial meniscus was identified.  It was resected using a meniscal resector.  It was then further contoured using arthroscopic shaver.  Attention was then taken to the lateral compartment.  A partial meniscectomy was performed using the resector and the shaver.  The posterior periphery of the lateral meniscus was also noticed to be unstable.  A repair was then performed using two fasting fixed meniscal repair sutures to help anchor the meniscus around the popliteus tendon.  There was noted to be excellent fixation.  The shaver was then taken into the intrachondral notch.  First a partial chondroplasty was performed on the patella to remove the loose articular debris as well as a partial synovectomy to the medial aspect of the patellar femoral joint.  Next, the remnant of the anterior cruciate ligament was removed using the arthroscopic shaver and arthroplasty was then performed on the medial aspect of the lateral femoral condyle.  Next, a tibial guide was placed through the anterior medial portal.  A ___ pin was then placed up through the anterior incision entering the tibial eminence just anterior to the posterior cruciate ligament.  This tibial tunnel was then drilled using 8 mm cannulated drill.  Next, an over-the-top guide was then placed at approximately the 11:30 position.  A ____ pin was then placed into the femur and 8 mm drill was then used to drill this femoral tunnel approximately 35 mm.  Next the U shape guide was placed through tibial tunnel into the femur.  A pin was then placed through the distal femur from lateral to medial, through the U-shaped guide a puller wire was then passed through the distal femur.  It was then pulled out through the tibial tunnel using the You-shaped guide.  The tendon was then placed around the wire.  The wire was pulled back up through the tibial into the femoral tunnel.  A 40 mm bioabsorbable pin was then placed through the femoral tunnel securing the hamstring tendons.  Attention was then pulled through the tibial tunnel.  The knee was cycled approximately 20 times.  A 9 mm bioabsorbable screw was then placed through the tibial tunnel fixating the distal aspect of the graft.  There was noted definite fixation of the graft.  There was no evidence of impingement either in full flexion or full extension.  The knee was copiously irrigated and it was then suctioned dry.  A longitudinal incision was made just medial to the patellofemoral joint.  Soft tissues were carefully dissected and the medial retinaculum was incised along with the incision.  Following this, a release of lateral retinaculum was performed using a knife to further release the patellofemoral joint and allow further medial plication.  The medial retinaculum was then plicated using #1 Ethibond sutures and then oversewn with #0 Vicryl suture.  The subcuticular tissues were reapproximated with #2-0 Vicryl simple interrupted sutures followed by a #4-0 PDS running subcuticular stitch.  She was placed in a DonJoy knee immobilizer.  The tourniquet was deflated.  It was noted the lower extremity was warm and pink with good capillary refill.  She was transferred to the recovery room in apparent stable and satisfactory condition.  Prognosis for this patient is guarded.  She will be full weightbearing on the lower extremity using the knee immobilizer locked in extension.  She may remove her dressing two to three days, however, follow back in the office in 10 to 14 days for suture removal.  She will require one to two more physical therapy to help regain motion and strength to the lower extremity.',\n",

He was then scheduled for I&D and excision of the bursa.  Risks and benefits were discussed.  No guarantees were made or implied.,PROCEDURE: , The patient was brought to the operating room and once an adequate sedation was achieved, the left elbow was injected with 0.25% plain Marcaine.  The left upper extremity was prepped and draped in standard sterile fashion.  On examination of the left elbow, there was presence of thickening of the bursal sac.  There was a couple of millimeter opening of skin breakdown from where the serous drainage was noted.  An incision was made midline of the olecranon bursa with an elliptical incision around the open wound, which was excised with skin.  The incision was carried proximally and distally.  The olecranon bursa was significantly thickened and scarred.  Excision of the olecranon bursa was performed.  There was significant evidence of thickening of the bursa with some evidence of adhesions.  Satisfactory olecranon bursectomy was performed.  The wound margins were debrided.  The wound was thoroughly irrigated with Pulsavac irrigation lavage system mixed with antibiotic solution.  There was no evidence of a loose body.  There was no bleeding or drainage.  After completion of the bursectomy and I&D, the skin margins, which were excised were approximated with 2-0 nylon in horizontal mattress fashion.  The open area of the skin, which was excised was left _________ and was dressed with 0.25-inch iodoform packing.  Sterile dressings were placed including Xeroform, 4x4, ABD, and Bias.

Biopsy was obtained and revealed squamous carcinoma.  The lesion extended slightly above the hymeneal ring and because of vaginal involvement was classified as a T3/Nx/Mx on clinical examination.  Of note, past history is significant for pelvic radiation for cervical cancer many years previously.,FINDINGS: , The examination under anesthesia revealed a 1.5 cm nodule of disease extending slightly above the hymeneal ring.  There was no palpable lymphadenopathy in either inguinal node region.  There were no other nodules, ulcerations, or other lesions.  At the completion of the procedure there was no clinical evidence of residual disease.,PROCEDURE:,  The patient was brought to the Operating Room with an IV in place.  She was placed in the low anterior lithotomy position after adequate anesthesia had been induced.  Examination under anesthesia was performed with findings as noted, after which she was prepped and draped.  The femoral triangles were marked and a 10 cm skin incision was made parallel to the inguinal ligament approximately 3 cm below the ligament.  Camper's fascia was divided and skin flaps were elevated with sharp dissection and ligation of vessels where necessary.  The lymph node bundles were mobilized by incising the loose areolar tissue attachments to the fascia of the rectus abdominis.  The fascia around the sartorius muscle was divided and the specimen was reflected from lateral to medial.  The cribriform fascia was isolated and dissected with preservation of the femoral nerve.  The femoral sheath containing artery and vein was opened and vessels were stripped of their lymphatic attachments.  The medial lymph node bundle was isolated, and Cloquet's node was clamped, divided, and ligated bilaterally.  The saphenous vessels were identified and preserved bilaterally.  The inferior margin of the specimen was ligated, divided, and removed.  Inguinal node sites were irrigated and excellent hemostasis was noted.  Jackson-Pratt drains were placed and Camper's fascia was approximated with simple interrupted stitches.  The skin was closed with running subcuticular stitches using 4-0 Monocryl suture.,Attention was turned to the radical vulvectomy specimen.  A marking pen was used to outline the margins of resection allowing 15-20 mm of margin on the inferior, lateral, and anterior margins.  The medial margin extended into the vagina and was approximately 5-8 mm.  The skin was incised and underlying adipose tissue was divided with electrocautery.  Vascular bundles were isolated, divided, and ligated.  After removal of the specimen, additional margin was obtained from the right vaginal side wall adjacent to the tumor site.  Margins were submitted on the right posterior, middle, and anterior vaginal side walls.  After removal of the vaginal margins, the perineum was irrigated with four liters of normal saline and deep tissues were approximated with simple interrupted stitches of 2-0 Vicryl suture.  The skin was closed with interrupted horizontal mattress stitches using 3-0 Vicryl suture.  The final sponge, needle, and instrument counts were correct at the completion of the procedure.

It was felt that the patient was now a candidate for a halo vest placement given that chance of going to the OR were much smaller.  She was consented for the procedure, and I sought the help of ABC and felt that a PMT halo would be preferable to a Bremer halo vest.  The patient had this procedure done at the bedside, in the SICU room #1.  I used a combination of some morphine 1 mg and Versed 2 mg for this procedure.  I also used local anesthetic, with 1% Xylocaine and epinephrine a total of 15 to 20 cc.,PROCEDURE DETAILS:,  The patient's head was positioned on some towels, the retroauricular region was shaved, and the forehead and the posterolateral periauricular regions were prepped with Betadine.  A large PMT crown was brought in and fixed to the skull with pins under local anesthetic.  Excellent fixation achieved.  It was lateral to the supraorbital nerves and 1 fingerbreadth above the brows and the ear pinnae.,I then put the vest on, by sitting the patient up, stabilizing her neck.  The vest was brought in from the front as well and connected.  Head was tilted appropriately, slightly extended, and in the midline.  All connections were secured and pins were torqued and tightened.,During the procedure, the patient did fine with no significant pain.,Post-procedure, she is neurologically intact and she remained intact throughout.

A descending aortogram demonstrated discrete coarctation of the aorta approximately 8 mm distal to the origin of the left subclavian artery.  The transverse arch measured 5 mm.  Isthmus measured 4.7 mm and coarctation measured 2.9 x 1.8 mm at the descending aorta level.  The diaphragm measured 5.6 mm.  The pigtail catheter was exchanged for a wedge catheter, which was then directed into the right innominate artery.  This catheter was exchanged over a wire for a Tyshak mini 6 x 2 cm balloon catheter which was advanced across the coarctation and inflated with complete disappearance of discrete waist.  Pressure pull-back following angioplasty, however, demonstrated a residual of 15-20 mmHg gradient.  Repeat angiogram showed mild improvement in degree of aortic narrowing.  The angioplasty was then performed using a Tyshak mini 7 x 2 cm balloon catheter with complete disappearance of mild waist.  The pigtail catheter was then reintroduced for a pressure pull-back measurement and final angiogram.,Flows were calculated by the Fick technique using an assumed oxygen consumption.,Cineangiograms were obtained with injection in the descending aorta.,After angiography, two normal-appearing renal collecting systems were visualized.  The catheters and sheaths were removed and topical pressure applied for hemostasis.  The patient was returned to the pediatric intensive care unit in satisfactory condition.  There were no complications.,DISCUSSION: , Oxygen consumption was assumed to be normal.  Mixed venous saturation was low due to mild systemic arterial desaturation and anemia.  There is no evidence of significant intracardiac shunt.  Further the heart was desaturated due to VQ mismatch.,Phasic right-sided pressures were normal as was the right pulmonary artery capillary wedge pressure with the A-wave similar to the normal left ventricular end-diastolic pressure of 12 mmHg.  Left ventricular systolic pressure was mildly increased with a 60 mmHg systolic gradient into the ascending aorta and a 29 mmHg systolic gradient on pressure pull-back to the descending aorta.  The calculated flows were mildly increased.  Vascular resistances were normal.  A cineangiogram with contrast injection in the descending aorta showed a normal left aortic arch with normal origins of the brachiocephalic vessels.  There is discrete juxtaductal coarctation of the aorta.  Flow within the intercostal arteries was retrograde.  Following balloon angioplasty of coarctation of the aorta, there was slight fall in the mixed venous saturation and an increase in systemic arterial saturation as the fall in left ventricular systolic pressure from 99 mmHg to 92 mmHg.  There remained a 4 mmHg systolic gradient into the ascending aorta and 9 mmHg systolic gradient pressure pull-back to the descending aorta.  The calculated systemic flow fell to normal values.  Final angiogram with injection in the descending aorta demonstrated improved caliber of coarctation of the aorta with mild intimal irregularity and a small left lateral filling defect consistent with a small intimal tear in the region of the ductus arteriosus.  There is brisk flow in the descending aorta and appropriate flow in the intercostal arteries.  The narrowest diameter of the aorta measured 4.9 x 4.2 mm.,DIAGNOSES:  ,1.  Juxtaductal coarctation of the aorta.,2.  Dilated cardiomyopathy.,3.  Bicuspid aortic valve.,4.  Patent foramen ovale.,INTERVENTION: , Balloon dilation of coarctation of the aorta.,MANAGEMENT: , The case will be discussed at combined Cardiology and Cardiothoracic Surgery Case Conference.  The patient will be allowed to recover from the current intervention with the hopes of complete left ventricular function recovery.  The patient will undoubtedly require formal coarctation of the aorta repair surgically in 4-6 months.  The further cardiologic care will be directed by Dr. X.',\n",

Steroid injection, stenosing tenosynovitis of right middle finger.,ANESTHESIA:  ,Monitored anesthesia care with regional anesthesia applied by surgeon.,TOURNIQUET TIME: , Left upper extremity was 15 minutes.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:,  With the patient under adequate monitored anesthesia, the left upper extremity was prepped and draped in a sterile manner.  The arm was exsanguinated.  The tourniquet was elevated at 290 mmHg.  Construction lines were made on the left palm to identify the ring ray.  A transverse incision was made in the palm between FCR and FCU, one finger breadth proximal to the interval between the glabrous skin of the palm and normal forearm skin.  Blunt dissection exposed the antebrachial fascia.  Hemostasis was obtained with bipolar cautery.  A distal based window in the antebrachial fascia was then fashioned.  Care was taken to protect the underlying contents.  A synovial elevator was used to palpate the undersurface of the transverse carpal ligament, and synovium was elevated off this undersurface.,Hamate sounds were then used to palpate the Hood of Hamate.  The Agee Inside Job was then inserted into the proximal incision.  The transverse carpal ligament was easily visualized through the portal.  Using palmar pressure, transverse carpal ligament was held against the portal as the instrument was inserted down the transverse carpal ligament to the distal end.  The distal end of the transverse carpal ligament was then identified in the window.  The blade was then elevated, and the Agee Inside Job was withdrawn, dividing transverse carpal ligament under direct vision.  After complete division of transverse carpal ligament, the Agee Inside Job was reinserted.  Radial and ulnar edges of the transverse carpal ligament were identified and complete release was accomplished.  One mL of Celestone was then introduced into the carpal tunnel and irrigated free.  ,The wound was then closed with a running 3-0 Prolene subcuticular stitch.  Steri-strips were applied and a sterile dressing was applied over the Steri-strips.  The tourniquet was deflated.  The patient was awakened from anesthesia and returned to the recovery room in satisfactory condition having tolerated the procedure well.,Attention was turned to the right palm where after a sterile prep, the right middle finger flexor sheath was injected with 0.5 mL of 1% plain Xylocaine and 0.5 mL of Depo-Medrol 40 mg/mL.  A Band-Aid dressing was then applied.,The patient was then awakened from the anesthesia and returned to the recovery room in satisfactory condition having tolerated the procedure well.',\n",
       " 'PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , After written consent was obtained from the patient, the patient was brought back into the operating room and identified.  The patient was placed in the operating room table in supine position and given general anesthetic.,Ancef 1 g was given for infectious prophylaxis.  Once the patient was under general anesthesia, the knee was prepped and draped in usual sterile fashion.  Once the knee was fully prepped and draped, then we made 2 standard portals medial and lateral.  Through the lateral portal, the camera was placed.  Through the medial portal, tools were placed.  We proceeded to examine scarring of the patellofemoral joint.  Then we probed the patellofemoral joint.  A chondroplasty was performed using a shaver.  Then we moved down to the lateral gutter.  Some loose bodies were found using a shaver and dissection.  We moved down the medial gutter.  No plica was found.,We moved into the medial joint; we found that the medial meniscus was intact.  We moved to the lateral joint and found that the lateral meniscus was intact.  Pictures were taken.  We drained the knee and washed out the knee with copious amounts of sterile saline solution.  The instruments were removed.  The 2 portals were closed using 3-0 nylon suture.  Xeroform, 4 x 4s, Kerlix x2, and TED stocking were placed.  The patient was successfully extubated and brought to the recovery room in stable condition.  I then spoke with the family going over the case, postoperative instructions, and followup care.',\n",

       " \"CONSULT REQUEST FOR:, Medical management.,The patient has been in special procedures now for over 2 hours and I am unable to examine.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:, Obtained from Dr. A on an 81-year-old white female, who is right handed, who by history, had a large stroke to the right brain, causing left body findings, last night. She was unfortunately outside of the window for emergent treatment and had a negative CT scan of the head. Was started on protocol medication and that is similar to TPA, which is an investigational study.,During the evaluation she was found to be in atrial fibrillation on admission with hypertension that was treated with labetalol en route. Her heart rate was 130. She was brought down with Cardizem. She received the study drug in the night and about an hour later thought to have another large stroke effecting the opposite side of the brain, that the doctors and company think is probably cardioembolic and not related to the study drug, as TPA has no obvious known association with this.,At that time the patient became comatose and required emergent intubation and paralyzation. Her diastolic at that time rose up to 190, likely the result of the acute second stroke. She is currently in arteriogram and a clot has been extracted from the proximal left carotid, but there is still distal clot that they are working on. Dr. A has updated the family to her extremely guarded and critical prognosis.,At present, it is not known yet, we do not have the STAT echocardiogram, if she has a large clot in the heart or if she could have a patent foramen ovale clot in the legs that has been passed to the heart. Echo that is pending, and cannot be done till the patient is out of arteriogram, which is her lifesaving procedure right now.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:, Complete review of systems is unobtainable at present. From what I can tell, is that she is scheduled for an upcoming bladder distension surgery and I do not know if this is why she is off Coumadin for chronic AFib or what, at this point. Tremor for 3-4 years, diagnosed as early Parkinson's.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:, GERD, hypertension times 20 years, arthritis, Parkinson's, TIA, chronic atrial fibrillation, on Coumadin three years.,PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:, Cholecystectomy, TAH 33, gallstones, back surgery 1998, thoracotomy for unknown reason at present.,ALLERGIES:, MORPHINE, SULFAS (RASH), PROZAC.,MEDICATIONS AT HOME: Lanoxin 0.25 daily; Inderal LA 80 daily; MOBIC 7.5 daily; Robaxin 750 q.8; aspirin 80 one daily; acyclovir dose unknown daily; potassium, dose unknown; oxazepam 15 mg daily; aspirin 80 one daily; ibuprofen PRN; Darvocet-N 100 PRN.,SOCIAL HISTORY:, She does not drink or smoke. Lives in Fayetteville, Tennessee.,FAMILY HISTORY:, Mother died of cancer, unknown type. Dad died of an MI.,VACCINATION STATUS: Unknown.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,VITAL SIGNS: On arrival were temperature 97.1, blood pressure 174/100, heart rate 100, 97%, respirations 15.,GENERAL: She was apparently alert and able to give history on arrival. Currently do not have any available vital signs or physical exam, as I cannot get to the patient.,LABORATORY: ,Reviewed and are remarkable for white count of 13 with 76 neutrophils. BMP is normal, except for a blood sugar of 157, hemoglobin A1c is pending. TSH 2.1, cholesterol 165, Digoxin 1.24, CPK 57. ABG 7.47/32/459 on 100%. Magnesium 1.5. ESR 9, coags normal.,EKG is pending my review.,Chest x-ray is read as mild cardiomegaly and atherosclerotic aorta.,Chest x-ray, shoulder films and CT scan of the head: I have reviewed. Chest x-ray has good ET tube placement. She has mild cardiomegaly. Some mild interstitial opacities consistent with OGD and minimal amount of atherosclerosis of the aorta.,CT scan of the head: I do not see any active bleeding.,X-rays of the shoulders appear intact to me and we are awaiting radiologies final approval on those.,ASSESSMENT/PLAN/PROBLEMS:,1. Large cardioembolic stroke initially to the right brain, with devastating effects, and now stroke into the left brain as well, with fluctuating mental status. Obviously she is in critical condition and stable with multiple strokes. One must also wonder if she could have a large clot burden below the heart and patent foramen ovale, etc. We need STAT records from her prior cardiologist and prior echocardiogram report to see exactly what are the details. I have ordered a STAT echo and to have the group that sees her read it, that if he has a large clot burdened in the heart or has distal clot with a PFO we may be able to better prognosticate at this point. Obviously, she cannot have any anticoagulants, except for the study drug, at present, which is her only chance and hopefully they will be able to retrieve most of the clot with emergency retrieval device as activated heroically, by Dr. A and interventional radiology.,2. Hypertension/atrial fibrillation: This will be a difficult management and the fact that she has been on a beta-blocker for Parkinson's, she may have withdrawal to the beta-blockers as we remove this. Given her atrial fibrillation, I do agree the safest agent right now is to use a Cardizem drip as needed and would use it for systolic greater than 160 to 180, or diastolics greater than 90 to 100. Also, would use it to control the atrial fibrillation. We would, however, be very cautious not to put her in heart block with the Digoxin and the beta-blocker on board. Weighing all risks and benefits, I think that given the fact that she has a beta-blocker on board and Digoxin, we would like to avoid the beta-blocker for vasospasm protection and will favor using calcium channel blocker for now. If, however, we run into trouble with this, I would prefer to switch her to Brevibloc or an Esmolol drip and see how she does, as she may withdraw from the beta-blocker. I will be watching this closely and managing the hypertension as I see fit at the moment, based on all factors. Will also ask cardiology if she has one that sees her here, to help guide this. Her Digoxin level is appropriate, as well as a TSH. I do not feel that we need to work this up further, other than the STAT echo and ultrasound of the leg.,3. Respiratory failure requiring ventilator: I have discussed this with Dr. Devlin, we do not feel the need to hyperventilate her at present. We will keep her comfortable on the breathing machine and try to keep her pH in a normal range, around 7.4, and her CO2 in the 30 to 40 range. If she has brain swelling, we will need to hyperventilate her to a pCO2 of 30 and a pH of 7.5, to optimize the cardiac arrhythmia potential of alkalosis weighed with the control of brain swelling.,4. Optimize electrolytes as you can.,5. Deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis for now, with thigh-high TED hose, possibly SCDs, although I do not have experience with the vampire/venom to know if we need to worry about DIC which the SCDs may worsen. Will follow daily CBCs for that.,6. Nutrition: Will go ahead and start a low dose of tube feeds and hope that she does survive.,I will defer all updates to the family for the next 24 to 48 hours to Dr. Devlin's expertise, given her unknown and fluctuating neurologic prognosis.,Thank you so much for allowing us to participate in her care. We will be happy to do all medication treatment until the point that I feel that I would need any help from critical care. I believe that we will be able to manage her fully at this point, for simplicity sake.\",\n",

Carpal tunnel release.,2. de Quervain's release.,ANESTHESIA: , MAC,COMPLICATIONS: , None.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:  ,After administering appropriate antibiotics and MAC anesthesia, the upper extremity was prepped and draped in the usual standard fashion.  The arm was exsanguinated with Esmarch and the tourniquet inflated to 250 mmHg.,A longitudinal incision was made in line with the 4th ray, from Kaplan's cardinal line proximally to 1 cm distal to the volar wrist crease.  The dissection was carried down to the superficial aponeurosis.  The subcutaneous fat was dissected radially from 2-3 mm and the superficial aponeurosis cut on this side to leave a longer ulnar leaf.,The ulnar leaf of the cut superficial aponeurosis was dissected ulnarly, and the distal edge of the transverse carpal ligament was identified with a hemostat.  The hemostat was gently placed under the transverse carpal ligament to protect the contents of the carpal tunnel, and the ligament was cut on its ulnar side with a knife directly onto the hemostat.  The antebrachial fascia was cut proximally under direct vision with scissors.,After irrigating the wound with copious amounts of normal saline, the radial leaf of the cut transverse carpal ligament was repaired to the ulnar leaf of the cut superficial aponeurosis with 4-0 Vicryl.  Care was taken to avoid entrapping the motor branch of the median nerve in the suture.  A hemostat was placed under the repair to ensure that the median nerve was not compressed.  The skin was repaired with 5-0 nylon interrupted stitches.,The first dorsal compartment was addressed through a transverse incision at the level of the radial styloid tip.  Dissection was carried down with care taken to avoid and protect the superficial radial nerve branches.  I released the compartment in a separate subsheath for the EPB on the dorsal side.  Both ends of the sheath were released to lengthen them, and then these were repaired with 4-0 Vicryl.  It was checked to make sure that there was significant room remaining for the tendons.  This was done to prevent postoperative subluxation.,I then irrigated and closed the wounds in layers.  Marcaine with epinephrine was placed into all wounds, and dressings and splint were placed.  The patient was sent to the recovery room in good condition, having tolerated the procedure well.\",\n",
       " \"Mr. XYZ forgot his hearing aids at home today and is severely hearing impaired and most of the interview had to be conducted with me yelling at him at the top of my voice.  For all these reasons, this was not really under the best circumstances and I had to curtail the amount of time I spent trying to get a history because of the physical effort required in extracting information from this patient.  The patient was seen late because he had not filled in the patient questionnaire.  To summarize the history here, Mr. XYZ who is not very clear on events from the past, sustained a work-related injury some time in 1998.  At that time, he was driving an 18-wheeler truck.  The patient indicated that he slipped off the rear of his truck while loading vehicles to his trailer.  He experienced severe low back pain and eventually a short while later, underwent a fusion of L4-L5 and L5-S1.  The patient had an uneventful hospital course from the surgery, which was done somewhere in Florida by a surgeon, who he does not remember.  He was able to return to his usual occupation, but then again had a second work-related injury in May of 2005.  At that time, he was required to boat trucks to his rig and also to use a chain-pulley system to raise and lower the vehicles.  Mr. XYZ felt a popping sound in his back and had excruciating low back pain and had to be transported to the nearest hospital.  He was MRI'ed at that time, which apparently showed a re-herniation of an L5-S1 disc and then, he somehow ended up in Houston, where he underwent fusion by Dr. W from L3 through S2.  This was done on 12/15/2005.  Initially, he did fairly well and was able to walk and move around, but then gradually the pain reappeared and he started getting severe left-sided leg pain going down the lateral aspect of the left leg into his foot.  He is still complaining of the severe pain right now with tingling in the medial two toes of the foot and significant weakness in his left leg.  The patient was referred to Dr. A, pain management specialist and Dr. A has maintained him on opioid medications consisting of Norco 10/325 mg for breakthrough pain and oxycodone 30 mg t.i.d. with Lunesta 3 mg q.h.s. for sleep, Carisoprodol 350 mg t.i.d., and Lyrica 100 mg q.daily.  The patient states that he is experiencing no side effects from medications and takes medications as required.  He has apparently been drug screened and his drug screening has been found to be normal.  The patient underwent an extensive behavioral evaluation on 05/22/06 by TIR Rehab Center.  At that time, it was felt that Mr. XYZ showed a degree of moderate level of depression.  There were no indications in the evaluation that Mr. XYZ showed any addictive or noncompliant type behaviors.  It was felt at that time that Mr. XYZ would benefit from a brief period of individual psychotherapy and a course of psychotropic medications.  Of concern to the therapist at that time was the patient's untreated and unmonitored hypertension and diabetes.  Mr. XYZ indicated at that time, they had not purchased any prescription medications or any of these health-related issues because of financial limitations.  He still apparently is not under really good treatment for either of these conditions and on today's evaluation, he actually denies that he had diabetes.  The impression was that the patient had axis IV diagnosis of chronic functional limitations, financial loss, and low losses with no axis III diagnosis.  This was done by Rhonda Ackerman, Ph.D., a psychologist.  It was also suggested at that time that the patient should quit smoking.  Despite these evaluations, Mr. XYZ really did not get involved in psychotherapy and there was poor attendance of these visits, there was no clearance given for any surgical interventions and it was felt that the patient has benefited from the use of SSRIs.  Of concern in June of 2006 was that the patient had still not stopped smoking despite warnings.  His hypertension and diabetes were still not under good control and the patient was assessed at significant risk for additional health complications including stroke, reduced mental clarity, and future falls.  It was felt that any surgical interventions should be put on hold at that time.  In September of 2006, the patient was evaluated at Baylor College of Medicine in the Occupational Health Program.  The evaluation was done by a physician at that time, whose report is clearly documented in the record.  Evaluation was done by Dr. B.  At present, Mr. XYZ continues on with his oxycodone and Norco.  These were prescribed by Dr. A two and a half weeks ago and the patient states that he has enough medication left to last him for about another two and a half weeks.  The patient states that there has been no recent change in either the severity or the distribution of his pain.  He is unable to sleep because of pain and his activities of daily living are severely limited.  He spends most of his day lying on the floor, watching TV and occasionally will walk a while.  ***** from detailed questioning shows that his activities of daily living are practically zero.  The patient denies smoking at this time.  He denies alcohol use or aberrant drug use.  He obtains no pain medications from no other sources.  Review of MRI done on 02/10/06 shows laminectomies at L3 through S1 with bilateral posterior plates and pedicle screws with granulation tissue around the thecal sac and around the left L4-5 and S1 nerve roots, which appear to be retracted posteriorly.  There is a small right posterior herniation at L1-L2.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:,  Significant for hypertension, hypercholesterolemia and non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.  The patient does not know what medications he is taking for diabetes and denies any diabetes.  CABG in July of 2006 with no preoperative angina, shortness of breath, or myocardial infarction.  History of depression, lumbar fusion surgery in 2000, left knee surgery 25 years ago.,SOCIAL HISTORY:,  The patient is on disability.  He does not smoke.  He does not drink alcohol.  He is single.  He lives with a girlfriend.  He has minimal activities of daily living.  The patient cannot recollect when last a urine drug screen was done.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:,  No fevers, no headaches, chest pain, nausea, shortness of breath, or change in appetite.  Depressive symptoms of crying and decreased self-worth have been noted in the past.  No neurological history of strokes, epileptic seizures.  Genitourinary negative.  Gastrointestinal negative.

The patient is oriented x3 to time and place.  Weight 185 pounds, temperature 97.5, blood pressure 137/92, pulse 61.  The patient is complaining of pain of a 9/10.,Musculoskeletal:  The patient's gait is markedly antalgic with predominant weightbearing on the left leg.  There is marked postural deviation to the left.  Because of pain, the patient is unable to heel-toe or tandem gait.  Examination of the neck and cervical spine are within normal limits.  Range of motion of the elbow, shoulders are within normal limits.  No muscle spasm or abnormal muscle movements noted in the neck and upper extremities.  Head is normocephalic.  Examination of the anterior neck is within normal limits.  There is significant muscle wasting of the quadriceps and hamstrings on the left, as well as of the calf muscles.  Skin is normal.  Hair distribution normal.  Skin temperature normal in both the upper and lower extremities.  The lumbar spine curvature is markedly flattened.  There is a well-healed central scar extending from T12 to L1.  The patient exhibits numerous positive Waddell's signs on exam of the low back with inappropriate flinching and wincing with even the lightest touch on the paraspinal muscles.  Examination of the paraspinal muscles show a mild to moderate degree of spasm with a significant degree of tenderness and guarding, worse on the left than the right.  Range of motion testing of the lumbar spine is labored in all directions.  It is interesting that the patient cannot flex more than 5  in the standing position, but is able to sit without any problem.  There is a marked degree of sciatic notch tenderness on the left.

She was evaluated and scheduled for an elective procedure.,DESCRIPTION OF SURGERY:  ,The patient was brought to the operative suite and placed supine on the operating room table.  General anesthetic was administered.  Once appropriate anesthetic findings were achieved, the patient was intubated and prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner for a tonsillectomy.  He was placed in semi-Rose ___ position and a Crowe Davis-type mouth gag was introduced into the oropharynx.  Under an operating headlight, the oropharynx was clearly visualized.  The right tonsil was grasped with the fossa triangularis and using electrocautery enucleation technique, was removed from its fossa.  This followed placing the patient in a suspension position using a McIvor-type mouth gag and a red rubber Robinson catheter via the right naris.  Once the right tonsil was removed, the left tonsil was removed in a similar manner, once again using a needle point Bovie dissection at 20 watts.  With the tonsils removed, it was possible to visualize the adenoid pads.  The oropharynx was irrigated and the adenoid pad evaluated with an indirect mirror technique.  The adenoid pad was greater than 2+/4 and hypertrophic.  It was removed with successive passes of electrocautery suction.  The tonsillar fossa was then once again hemostased with suction cautery, injected with 0.5% ropivacaine with 1:100,000 adrenal solution and then closed with 2-0 Monocryl on an SH needle.  The redundant soft tissue of the uvula was removed posteriorly and cauterized with electrocautery to prevent swelling of the uvula in the postoperative period.  The patient's oropharynx and nasopharynx were irrigated with copious amounts of normal saline contained with small amount of iodine, and she was recovered from her general endotracheal anesthetic.  She was extubated and left the operating room in good condition to the postoperative recovery room area.,Estimated blood loss was minimal.  There were no complications.  Specimens produced were right and left tonsils.  The adenoid pad was ablated with electrocautery.\",\n",

This baby was doing well, and then, we had a significant increasing oxygen requirement from room air up to 85%.  He is now on 60% FiO2.,PHYSICAL FINDINGS,GENERAL:  He appears to be pink, well perfused, and slightly jaundiced.,VITAL SIGNS:  Pulse 156, 56 respiratory rate, 92% sat, and 59/28 mmHg blood pressure.,SKIN:  He was pink.,He was on the high-frequency ventilator with good wiggle.,His echocardiogram showed normal structural anatomy.  He has evidence for significant pulmonary hypertension.  A large ductus arteriosus was seen with bidirectional shunt.  A foramen ovale shunt was also noted with bidirectional shunt.  The shunting for both the ductus and the foramen ovale was equal left to right and right to left.,IMPRESSION: , My impression is that baby boy, XYZ, has significant pulmonary hypertension.  The best therapy for this is to continue oxygen.  If clinically worsens, he may require nitric oxide.  Certainly, Indocin should not be used at this time.  He needs to have lower pulmonary artery pressures for that to be considered.,Thank you very much for allowing me to be involved in baby XYZ's care.\",\n",

This is an enhancing lesion suspicious for renal cell carcinoma versus oncocytoma.  I discussed a variety of options with her, and she opted to proceed with a laparoscopic right radical nephrectomy.  All questions were answered, and she wished to proceed with surgery as planned.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:,  After acquisition of appropriate written and informed consent and administration of perioperative antibiotics, the patient was taken to the operating room and placed supine on the operating table.  Note that, sequential compression devices were placed on both lower extremities and were activated per induction of anesthesia.  After institution of adequate general anesthetic via the endotracheal route, she was placed into the right anterior flank position with the right side elevated in a roll and the right arm across her chest.  All pressure points were carefully padded, and she was securely taped to the table to prevent shifting during the procedure.  Her abdomen was then prepped and draped in the standard surgical fashion after placing a 16-French Foley catheter per urethra to gravity drainage.  The abdomen was insufflated in the right outer quadrant.  Note that, the patient had had previous surgery which complicated accesses somewhat and that she had a previous hysterectomy.  The abdomen was insufflated into the right lateral abdomen with Veress needle to 50 mm of pressure without incident.  We then placed a 10/12 Visiport trocar approximately 7 cm lateral to the umbilicus.  Once this had entered into the peritoneal cavity without incident, the remaining trocars were all placed.  Under direct laparoscopic visualization, we placed three additional trocars; an 11-mm screw-type trocar in the umbilicus, a 6-mm screw-type trocar in the upper midline approximately 7 cm above the umbilicus, and 10/12 trocar in the lower midline about 7 cm below the umbilicus within and over the old hysterectomy scar.  There were some adhesions of omentum to the underside of that scar, and these were taken down sharply using laparoscopic scissors.,We began nephrectomy procedure by reflecting the right colon, by incising the white line of Toldt.  This exposed the retroperitoneum on the right side.  The duodenum was identified and reflected medially in a Kocher maneuver using sharp dissection only.  We then identified the ureter and gonadal vein in the retroperitoneum.  The gonadal vein was left down along the vena cava, and the plane underneath the ureter was elevated and this plane was carried up towards the renal hilum.  Sequential packets of tissue were taken using primarily the LigaSure Atlas device.  Once we got to the renal hilum, it became apparent that this patient had two sets of renal arteries and veins.  We proceeded then and skeletonized the structures into four individual packets.  We then proceeded to perform the upper pole dissection and developing the plane above the kidney and between the kidney and adrenal gland.  The adrenal was spared during this procedure.  There was no contiguous connection between the renal mass and a right adrenal gland.  This plane of dissection was taken down primarily using the LigaSure device.  We then sequentially took the four vessels going to the kidney initially taking two renal arteries with the endo GI stapler and then to renal veins again with endo GI stapler sequential flaring.  Once this was completed, the kidney was free except for its attachment to the ureter and lateral attachments.  The lateral attachments of the kidney were taken down using the LigaSure Atlas device, and then the ureter was doubly clipped and transected.  The kidney was then freed within the retroperitoneum.  A 50-mm EndoCatch bag was introduced through the lower most trocar site, and the kidney was placed into this bag for subsequent extraction.  We extended the lower most trocar site approximately 6 cm to facilitate extraction.  The kidney was removed and passed off the table as a specimen for pathology.  This was bivalved by pathology, and we reviewed the specimen.',\n",

The patient was prepped and draped in the normal sterile fashion.  A lid speculum was placed into the right eye.  Paracentesis was made at the infratemporal quadrant.  This was followed by 1% nonpreservative lidocaine into the anterior chamber, roughly 250 microliters.  This was exchanged for Viscoat solution.  Next, a crescent blade was used to create a partial-thickness linear groove at the temporal limbus.  This was followed by a clear corneal bevel incision with a 3 mm metal keratome blade.  Circular capsulorrhexis was initiated with a cystitome and completed with Utrata forceps.  Balanced salt solution was used to hydrodissect the nucleus.  Nuclear material was removed via phacoemulsification with divide-and-conquer technique.  The residual cortex was removed via irrigation and aspiration.  The capsular bag was then filled with Provisc solution.  The wound was slightly enlarged.

The leg was exsanguinated by gravity and pneumatic tourniquet was inflated to 300 mmHg.,A straight anterior incision was carried down through the skin and subcutaneous tissue. Unilateral flaps were developed and a median retinacular parapatellar incision was made. The extensor mechanism was partially divided and the patella was everted. Some of the femoral bone spurs were resected using an osteotome and a rongeur. Ascending drill hole was made in the distal femur and the distal femoral cut, anterior and posterior and chamfer cuts were accomplished for a 67.5 femoral component.,At this point the ACL was resected. Some of the fat pad and synovium were resected, as well as both medial and lateral menisci. A posterior cruciate retractor was utilized, the tibia brought forward and a centering drill hole made in the tibia. The intramedullary guide was used for cutting the tibia. It was set at 8 mm. An additional 2 mm was resected because of a moderate defect medially.,A trial reduction was done with a 71 tibial baseplate. This was pinned and drilled and then trial reduction done with a 10-mm insert.,This gave good stability and a full range of motion.,The patella was measured with the calibers and 9 mm of bone was resected with an oscillating saw.

This was filled with a 15 x 20-mm Chronos VerteFill tricalcium phosphate plug.  At L4-L5, we used a 13-mm PEEK vertebral spacer with structural autograft and BMP, and then we placed a two-level 87-mm Integra sacral plate with 28 x 6-mm screws, two each at L4 and L5 and 36 x 6-mm screws at S1.,OPERATION IN DETAIL:,  The patient was placed under general endotracheal anesthesia.  The abdomen was prepped and draped in the usual fashion.  Dr. X made the approach, and once the L5-S1 disk space was identified, we incised this with a knife and then removed a large core of bone taking rotating cutters.  I was able to remove additional disk space and score the vertebral bodies.  The rest of the disk removal was done with the curette, scraping the endplates.  I tried various sized spacers, and at this point, we exposed the L5 body and took a dowel from the body and filled the hole with a 15 x 20-mm Chronos VerteFill tricalcium phosphate plug.  Half of this was used to fill the spacer at L5-S1, BMP was placed in the spacer as well and then it was tapped into place.  We then moved the vessels over the opposite way approaching the L4-L5 disk space laterally, and the disk was removed in a similar fashion and we also used a 13-mm PEEK vertebral spacer, but this is the variety that we could put in from one side.  This was filled with bone and BMP as well.  Once this was done, we were able to place an 87-mm Integra sacral plate down over the three vertebral bodies and place these screws.

Thoracic epidural.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , After obtaining informed consent from the patient, including a thorough explanation of the risks and benefits of the aforementioned procedure, the patient was taken to the operating room, and general endotracheal anesthesia was administered with a dual-lumen tube.  Next, the patient was placed in the left lateral decubitus position, and his right chest was prepped and draped in the standard surgical fashion.  We used a #10-blade scalpel to make an incision in the skin approximately 1 fingerbreadth below the angle of the scapula.  Dissection was carried down in a muscle-sparing fashion using Bovie electrocautery.  The 5th rib was counted, and the 6th interspace was entered.  The lung was deflated.  We identified the major fissure.  We then began by freeing up the inferior pulmonary ligament, which was done with Bovie electrocautery.  Next, we used Bovie electrocautery to dissect the pleura off the lung.  The pulmonary artery branches to the right upper lobe of the lung were identified.  Of note was the fact that there was a visible, approximately 4 x 4-cm mass in the right upper lobe of the lung without any other metastatic disease palpable.  As mentioned, a combination of Bovie electrocautery and sharp dissection was used to identify the pulmonary artery branches to the right upper lobe of the lung.  Next, we began by ligating the pulmonary artery branches of the right upper lobe of the lung.  This was done with suture ligature in combination with clips.  After taking the pulmonary artery branches of the right upper lobe of the lung, we used a combination of blunt dissection and sharp dissection with Metzenbaum scissors to separate out the pulmonary vein branch of the right upper lobe of the lung.  This likewise was ligated with a 0 silk.  It was stick-tied with a 2-0 silk.  It was then divided.  Next we dissected out the bronchial branch to the right upper lobe of the lung.  A curved Glover was placed around the bronchus.  Next a TA-30 stapler was fired across the bronchus.  The bronchus was divided with a #10-blade scalpel.  The specimen was handed off.  We next performed a mediastinal lymph node dissection.  Clips were applied to the base of the feeding vessels to the lymph nodes.  We inspected for any signs of bleeding.  There was minimal bleeding.  We placed a #32-French anterior chest tube, and a #32-French posterior chest tube.  The rib space was closed with #2 Vicryl in an interrupted figure-of-eight fashion.  A flat Jackson-Pratt drain, #10 in size, was placed in the subcutaneous flap.  The muscle layer was closed with a combination of 2-0 Vicryl followed by 2-0 Vicryl, followed by 4-0 Monocryl in a running subcuticular fashion.  Sterile dressing was applied.  The instrument and sponge count was correct at the end of the case.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to the PACU in good condition.',\n",

Liposuction of the supraumbilical abdomen.,ANESTHESIA: , General.,INDICATION FOR OPERATION:,  The patient is a 31-year-old white female who previously has undergone latissimus dorsi flap and implant, breast reconstruction.  She now had lateralization of the implant with loss of medial fullness for which she desired correction.  It was felt that mobilization of the implant medially would provide the patient significant improvement and this was discussed with the patient at length.  The patient also had a small dog ear in the flank area on the right from the latissimus flap harvest, which was to be corrected.  She had also had liposuction of the periumbilical and infraumbilical abdomen with desire to have great improvement superiorly, was felt to be a candidate for such.  The above-noted procedure was discussed with the patient in detail.  The risks, benefits and potential complications were discussed.  She was marked in the upright position and then taken to the operating room for the above-noted procedure.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE: , The patient was taken to the operating room and placed in the supine position.  Following adequate induction of general LMA anesthesia, the chest and abdomen was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  The supraumbilical abdomen was then injected with a solution of 5% lidocaine with epinephrine, as was the dog ear.  At this time, the superior central scar was then excised, dissection continued through the subcutaneous tissue, the underlying latissimus muscle until the capsule of the implant was reached.  This was then opened.  The implant was removed and placed on the back table in antibiotic solution.  Using Bovie cautery, the medial capsule was released and undermining was then performed with release of the muscle to the level of the proposed medial projection of the breast.  The inframammary fold medially was secured with 2-0 PDS suture to create greater takeoff point at this level which in the upright position and using a sizer produced a good form.  The lateral pocket was diminished by series of 2-0 PDS suture to provide medialization of the implant.  The implant was then placed back into the submuscular pocket with much improved positioning and medial fullness.  With this completed, the implant was again removed, antibiotic irrigation was performed.  A drain was placed and brought out through a separate inferior stab wound incision and hemostasis was confirmed.  The implant was then replaced and the wound was then closed in layers using 2-0 PDS running suture on the muscle and 3-0 Monocryl Dermabond subcuticular sutures.  The 2.5 cm dog ear was then excised into and including the subcutaneous tissue, even contouring was achieved and this was closed with two layers using 3-0 Monocryl suture.  Using a #3 cannula, a superior umbilical incision, liposuction was carried out into the supraumbilical abdomen, removing approximately 40 to 50 mL of fat with improved supraumbilical contours.  This was closed with 6-0 Prolene suture.  The patient was placed in a compressive garment after treating the incision with Dermabond, Steri-Strips and antibiotic ointment around the drain site and umbilicus.  A Kerlix dressing and a surgical bra was placed to the chest area.  A compressive garment was placed.  The patient was then aroused from anesthesia, extubated, and taken to the recovery room in stable condition.  Sponge, needle, lap, instrument counts were all correct.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no complications.  The estimated blood loss was approximately 25 mL.',\n",

We increased his extension and flexion to about 20 to 120 degrees and the pronation and supination to about 40 degrees.,LOCAL ANESTHETIC:  ,10 mL of 0.25% Marcaine.,HISTORY AND PHYSICAL: , The patient is a 10-year-old right-hand dominant male, who threw himself off a quad on 10/10/2007.  The patient underwent open reduction and internal fixation of his left elbow fracture dislocation.  The patient also sustained a nondisplaced right glenoid neck fracture.  The patient's fracture has healed without incident, although he had significant postoperative stiffness for which he is undergoing physical therapy, as well as use of a Dynasplint.  The patient is neurologically intact distally.  Given the fact that his fracture has healed, surgery was recommended for hardware removal to decrease his irritation with elbow extension from the hardware.  Risks and benefits of the surgery were discussed.  The risks of surgery included the risk of anesthesia, infection, bleeding, changes in sensation and motion of the extremities, failure to remove hardware, failure to relieve pain, continued postoperative stiffness.  All questions were answered and the parents agreed to the above plan.,PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was taken to the operating room and placed supine on the operating table.  General anesthesia was then administered.  The patient's left upper extremity was then prepped and draped in a standard surgical fashion.  Using fluoroscopy, the patient's K-wire was located.  An incision was made over his previous scar.  A subcutaneous dissection then took place in the plane between the subcutaneous fat and muscles.  The K-wires were easily palpable.  A small incision was made into the triceps, which allowed for visualization of the two pins, which were removed without incident.  The wound was then irrigated.  The triceps split was now closed using #2-0 Vicryl.  The subcutaneous tissue was also closed using #2-0 Vicryl and the skin with #4-0 Monocryl.  The wound was clean and dry and dressed with Steri-Strips, Xeroform, and 4 x 4s, as well as bias.  A total of 10 mL of 0.25% Marcaine was injected into the incision, as well as the joint line.  At the beginning of the case, prior to removal of the hardware, the arm was taken through some strenuous manipulations with improvement of his extension to 20 degrees, flexion to 130 degrees and pronation supination to about 40 degrees.,DIAGNOSTIC IMPRESSION:  ,The postoperative films demonstrated no fracture, no retained hardware.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and was subsequently taken to the recovery room in stable condition.,POSTOPERATIVE PLAN: , The patient will restart physical therapy and Dynasplint in 3 days.

The area of the left pectoral deltoid and subclavian area was sterilely prepped and draped in the usual manner.  We also scrubbed for approximately eight minutes.  Using lidocaine with epinephrine, the area of the left pectoral deltoid region and subclavian area was then fully anesthetized.  Using an #18 gauge Cook needle, the left subclavian vein was cannulated at two separate sites without difficulty, where two separate guidewires were inserted into the left subclavian vein.  The Cook needles were removed.  Then the guidewires were secured in place with hemostat.  Using a #10 and #15 scalpel blade, a 5 cm horizontal incision was made in the left pectodeltoid groove, where the skin was dissected and blunted on to the pectoralis major muscle.  The skin was then undermined making a pocket for the generator.  The guidewires were then tunneled through the performed pocket.  Subsequently, the atrial and ventricular leads were inserted through each one of the Cordis separately and respectively.  Initially, the ventricular lead was inserted, where a Cordis sheath was placed and the guidewire was removed.  After the thresholds and appropriate position was obtained for the ventricular lead, the Cordis sheath was then inserted for the atrial lead.  After the atrial lead was inserted and appropriately placed and thresholds were obtained, the Cordis was removed and then both leads were sutured in place with pectoralis major muscle with #1-0 silk suture.  The leads were then connected to a pulse generator.  The pocket was then irrigated and cleansed, where then the leads and the generators were inserted into that pocket.

Scattered patchy foci of decreased attenuation is seen in the subcortical and periventricular white matter consistent with chronic small vessel ischemic changes.  There are subtle areas of increased attenuation seen within the frontal lobes bilaterally.  Given the patient's clinical presentation, these likely represent small hemorrhagic contusions.  Other differential considerations include cortical calcifications, which are less likely.

       " 'REASON FOR EVALUATION: , The patient is a 37-year-old white single male admitted to the hospital through the emergency room.  I had seen him the day before in my office and recommended him to go into the hospital.  He had just come from a trip to Taho in Nevada and he became homicidal while there.  He started having thoughts about killing his mother.  He became quite frightened by that thought and called me during the weekend we were able to see him on that Tuesday after talking to him.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , This is a patient that has been suffering from a chronic psychotic condition now for a number of years.  He began to have symptoms when he was approximately 18 or 19 with auditory and visual hallucinations and paranoid delusions.  He was using drugs and smoking marijuana at that time has experimenting with LXV and another drugs too.  The patient has not used any drugs since age 25.  However, he has continued having intense and frequent psychotic bouts.  I have seen him now for approximately one year.  He has been quite refractory to treatment.  We tried different types of combination of medications, which have included Clozaril, Risperdal, lithium, and Depakote with partial response and usually temporary.  The patient has had starting with probably has had some temporary relief of the symptoms and they usually do not last more than a few days.  The dosages that we have used have been very high.  He has been on Clozaril 1200 mg combined with Risperdal up to 9 mg and lithium at a therapeutic level.  However, he has not responded.,He has delusions of antichrist.  He strongly believes that the dogs have a home in the neighborhood are communicating with him and criticizing him and he believes that all the people can communicate to him with telepathy including the animals.  He has paranoid delusions.  He also gets homicidal like prior to this admission.,PAST PSYCHIATRIC HISTORY:,  As mentioned before, this patient has been psychotic off and on for about 20 years now.  He has had years in which he did better on Clozaril and also his other medications.,With typical anti-psychotics, he has done well at times, but he eventually gets another psychotic bout.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: , He has a history of obesity and also of diabetes mellitus.  However, most recently, he has not been treated for diabetes since his last regular weight since he stopped taking Zyprexa.  The patient has chronic bronchitis.  He smokes cigarettes constantly up to 60 a day.,DRUG HISTORY:,  He stopped using drugs when he was 25.  He has got a lapse, but he was more than 10 years and he has been clean ever since then.  As mentioned before, he smokes cigarettes quite heavily and which has been a problem for his health since he also has chronic bronchitis.,PSYCHOSOCIAL STATUS: , The patient lives with his mother and has been staying with her for a few years now.  We have talked to her.  She is very supportive.  His only sister is also very supportive of him.  He has lived in the ABCD houses in the past.  He has done poorly in some of them.,MENTAL STATUS EXAMINATION:,  The patient appeared alert, oriented to time, place, and person.  His affect is flat.

       " \"CHIEF COMPLAINT: , Right shoulder pain.,HISTORY: , The patient is a pleasant, 31-year-old, right-handed, white female who injured her shoulder while transferring a patient back on 01/01/02.  She formerly worked for Veteran's Home as a CNA.  She has had a long drawn out course of treatment for this shoulder.  She tried physical therapy without benefit and ultimately came to a subacromion decompression in November 2002.  She had ongoing pain and was evaluated by Dr. X who felt that she had a possible brachial plexopathy.  He also felt she had a right superficial radial neuritis and blocked this with resolution of her symptoms.  He then referred her to ABCD who did EMG testing, demonstrating a right suprascapular neuropathy although a C5 radiculopathy could not be ruled out.  MRI testing on the cervical spine was then done which was negative for disk herniation and she underwent suprascapular nerve decompression of the scapular notch on 12/18/03.  She finally went to an anterior axillary nerve block because of ongoing pain in the anterior shoulder again by Dr. X.  She comes to me for impairment rating.  She has no chronic health problems otherwise, fevers, chills, or general malaise.  She is not working.  She is right-hand dominant.  She denies any prior history of injury to her shoulder.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:,  Negative aside from above.,FAMILY HISTORY: , Noncontributory.,SOCIAL HISTORY:  ,Please see above.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:,  Negative aside from above.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  ,A pleasant, age appropriate woman, moderately overweight, in no apparent distress.  Normal gait and station, normal posture, normal strength, tone, sensation and deep tendon reflexes with the exception of 4+/5 strength in the supraspinatus musculature on the right.  She has decreased motion in the right shoulder as follows.  She has 160 degrees of flexion, 155 degrees of abduction, 35 degrees of extension, 25 degrees of adduction, 45 degrees of internal rotation and 90 degrees of external rotation.  She has a positive impingement sign on the right.,ASSESSMENT:,  Right shoulder impingement syndrome, right suprascapular neuropathy.,DISCUSSION: , With a reasonable degree of medical certainty, she is at maximum medical improvement and she does have an impairment based on AMA Guide to the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment, Fifth Edition.  The reason for this impairment is the incident of 01/01/02.  For her suprascapular neuropathy, she is rated as a grade IV motor deficit which I rate as a 13% motor deficit.  This is multiplied by a maximum upper extremity impairment for involvement of the suprascapular nerve of 16% which produces a 2% impairment of the upper extremity when the two values are multiplied together, 2% impairment of the upper extremity.  For her lack of motion in the shoulder she also has additional impairment on the right.  She has a 1% impairment of the upper extremity due to lack of shoulder flexion.  She has a 1% impairment of the upper extremity due to lack of shoulder abduction.  She has a 1% impairment of the upper extremity due to lack of shoulder adduction.  She has a 1% impairment of the upper extremity due to lack of shoulder extension.  There is no impairment for findings in shoulder external rotation.  She has a 3% impairment of the upper extremity due to lack of shoulder internal rotation.  Thus the impairment due to lack of motion in her shoulder is a 6% impairment of the upper extremity.  This combines with the 2% impairment of the upper extremity due to weakness in the suprascapular nerve root distribution to produce an 8% impairment of the upper extremity which in turn is a 5% impairment of the whole person based on the AMA Guide to the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment, Fifth Edition, stated with a reasonable degree of medical certainty.\",\n",

At the present time, the patient is under radiation treatment.  Two weeks ago or so, she developed a large abdominal mass, which was cystic in nature and the radiologist inserted a pigtail catheter in the emergency room.  We proceeded to admit the patient and drained a significant amount of clear fluid in the subsequent days.  The cytology of the fluid was negative and the culture was also negative.  Eventually, the patient was sent home with the pigtail shut off and the patient a week later underwent a repeat CAT scan of the abdomen and pelvis.,The CAT scan showed accumulation of the fluid and the mass almost achieving 80% of the previous size.  Therefore, I called the patient home and she came to the emergency department where the service was provided.  At that time, I proceeded to work on the pigtail catheter after obtaining an informed consent and preparing and draping the area in the usual fashion.  Unfortunately, the catheter was open.  I did not have a drainage system at that time.  So, I withdrew directly with a syringe 700 mL of clear fluid.  The system was connected to the draining bag, and the patient was instructed to keep a log and how to use equipment.  She was given an appointment to see me in the office next Monday, which is three days from now.',\n",

The patella on the left was not resurfaced.,GROSS INTRAOPERATIVE FINDINGS: , Degenerative ware of three compartments of the trochlea, the medial, as well as the lateral femoral condyles as well was the plateau.  The surface of the patella was with a minimal ware and minimal osteophytes and we decided not to resurface the patellar component.,HISTORY:  ,This is a 69-year-old male with complaints of bilateral knee pain for several years and increased intensity in the past several months where it has affected his activities of daily living.  He attempted conservative treatment, which includes anti-inflammatory medications as well as cortisone and Synvisc.  This has only provided him with temporary relief.  It is for that reason, he is elected to undergo the above-named procedure.,All risks as well as complications were discussed with the patient, which include, but are not limited to infection, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, need for further surgery, and further pain.  He has agreed to undergo this procedure and a consent was obtained preoperatively.,PROCEDURE: , The patient was wheeled back to operating room #2 at ABCD General Hospital on 08/19/03 and was placed supine on the operating room table.  At this time, a nonsterile tourniquet was placed on the left upper thigh, but not inflated.  An Esmarch was then used to exsanguinate the extremity and the left extremity was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion for this procedure.  The tourniquet was then inflated to 325 mmHg.  At this time, a standard midline incision was made towards the total knee.  We did discuss preoperatively for a possible unicompartmental knee replacement for this patient, but he did have radiographic evidence of chondrocalcinosis of the lateral meniscus.  We did start off with a small midline skin incision in case we were going to do a unicompartmental.  Once we exposed the medial parapatellar mini-arthrotomy and visualized the lateral femoral condyle, we decided that this patient would not be an optimal candidate for unicompartmental knee replacement.  It is for this reason that we extended the incision and underwent with the total knee replacement.  Once the full medial parapatellar arthrotomy was performed with the subperiosteal dissection of the proximal tibia in order to evert the patella.  Once the patella was everted, we then used a drill to cannulate the distal femoral canal in order to place the intramedullary guide.  A Charnley awl was then used to remove all the intramedullary contents and they were removed from the knee.  At this time, a femoral sizer was then placed with reference to the posterior condyles and we measured a size F. Once this was performed, three degrees of external rotation was then drilled into the condyle in alignment with the epicondyles of the femur.  At this time, the intramedullary guide was then inserted and placed in three degrees of external rotation.  Our anterior cutting guide was then placed and an anterior cut was performed with careful protection of the soft tissues.  Next, this was removed and the distal femoral cutting guide was then placed in five degrees of valgus.  This was pinned to the distal femur and with careful protection of the collateral ligaments, a distal femoral cut was performed.  At this time, the intramedullary guide was removed and a final cutting block was placed.  This was placed in the center on the distal femur with 1 mm to 2 mm laterally translated for better patellar tracking.  At this time, the block was pinned and screwed in place with spring pins with careful protection of the soft tissues.  An oscillating saw was then used to resect the posterior and anterior cutting blocks with anterior and posterior chamfer as well as the notch cut.  Peg holes were then drilled.,The block was then removed and an osteotome was then used to remove all the bony cut pieces.  At this time with a better exposure of the proximal tibia, we placed external tibial guide.  This was placed with longitudinal axis of the tibia and carefully positioned in order to obtain an optimal cut for the proximal tibia.  At this time with careful soft tissue retraction and protection, an oscillating saw was used to make a proximal tibial osteotomy.  Prior to the osteotomy, the cut was checked with a depth gauge in order to assure appropriate bony resection.  At this time, a _blunt Kocher and Bovie cautery were used to remove the proximal tibial cut, which had soft tissue attachments.  Once this was removed, we then implanted our trial components of size F to the femur and a size 8 mm tibial tray with 12 mm plastic articulating surface.  The knee was taken through range of motion and revealed excellent femorotibial articulation.  The patella did tend to sublux somewhat laterally with extremes of flexion and it was for this reason, we performed a minimal small incision lateral retinacular release.  Distal lateral patella was tracked more uniformly within the patellar groove of the prosthesis.  At this time, an intraoperative x-ray was performed, which revealed excellent alignment with no varus angulation especially of the whole femur and tibial alignment and tibial cut.  At this time, the prosthesis was removed.  A McGill retractor was then reinserted and replaced peg tibial tray in order to peg the proximal tibia.  Once the drill holes were performed, we then copiously irrigated the wound and then suctioned it dry to get ready and prepped for cementation of the drilled components.  At this time, polymethyl methacrylate cement was then mixed.  The cement was placed on the tibial surface as well as the underneath surface of the component.  The component was then placed and impacted with excess cement removed.  In a similar fashion, the femoral component was also placed.  A 12 mm plastic tray was then placed and the leg held in full extension and compression in order to obtain adequate bony cement content.  Once the cement was fully hardened, the knee was flexed and a small osteotome was used to remove any extruding cement from around the prosthesis of the bone.  Once this was performed, copious irrigation was used to irrigate the wound and the wound was then suctioned dry.  The knee was again taken through range of motion with a 12 mm plastic as well as #14.  The #14 appeared to be a bit too tight especially in extremes of flexion.  We decided to go with a #12 mm polyethylene tray.  At this time, this was placed to the tibial articulation and then left in place.  This was rechecked with careful attention to detail with checking no soft tissue interpositioned between the polyethylene tray and the metal tray of the tibia.  The knee was again taken through range of motion and revealed excellent tracking of the patella with good femur and tibial contact.  A drain was placed and cut to length.,At this time, the knee was irrigated and copiously suction dried.  #1-0 Ethibond suture was then used to approximate the medial parapatellar arthrotomy in figure-of-eight fashion.  A tight capsular closure was performed.  This was reinforced with a #1-0 running Vicryl suture.  At this time, the knee was again taken through range of motion to assure tight capsular closure.  At this time, copious irrigation was used to irrigate the superficial wound.  #2-0 Vicryl was used to approximate the wound with figure-of-eight inverted suture.  The skin was then approximated with staples.  The leg was then cleansed.  Sterile dressing consisting of Adaptic, 4x4, ABDs, and Kerlix roll were then applied.  At this time, the patient was extubated and transferred to recovery in stable condition.  Prognosis is good for this patient.',\n",

All endometriosis had been identified laparoscopically from a previous surgery.  At the time of the surgery, all the tissue was quite thick and difficult to cut as well around the bladder flap and the uterus itself.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: , The patient was taken to the operating room and placed in supine position, at which time general form of anesthesia was administered by the anesthesia department.  The patient was then prepped and draped in the usual fashion for a low transverse incision.  Approximately two fingerbreadths above the pubic symphysis, a first knife was used to make a low transverse incision.  This was extended down to the level of the fascia.  The fascia was nicked in the center and extended in a transverse fashion.  The edges of the fascia were grasped with Kocher.  Both blunt and sharp dissection both caudally and cephalic was then completed consistent with Pfannenstiel technique.  The abdominal rectus muscle was divided in the midline and extended in a vertical fashion.  Perineum was entered at the high point and extended in a vertical fashion as well.  An O'Connor-O'Sullivan retractor was put in place on either side.  A bladder blade was put in place as well.  Uterus was grasped with a double-tooth tenaculum and large and small colon were packed away cephalically and held in place with free wet lap packs and a superior blade.  The bladder flap was released with Metzenbaum scissors and then dissected away caudally.  EndoGIA were placed down both sides of the uterus in two bites on each side with the staples reinforced with a medium Endoclip.  Two Heaney were placed on either side of the uterus at the level of cardinal ligaments.  These were sharply incised and both pedicles were tied off with 1 Vicryl suture.  Two _____ were placed from either side of the uterus at the level just inferior to the cervix across the superior part of the vaginal vault.  A long sharp knife was used to transect the uterus at the level of Merz forceps and the uterus and cervix were removed intact.  From there, the corners of the vaginal cuff were reinforced with figure-of-eight stitches.  Betadine soaked sponge was placed in the vaginal vault and a continuous locking stitch of 0 Vicryl was used to re-approximate the edges with a second layer used to reinforce the first.  Bladder flap was created with the use of 3-0 Vicryl and Gelfoam was placed underneath.  The EndoGIA was used to transect both the fallopian tube and ovaries at the infundibulopelvic ligament and each one was reinforced with medium clips.  The entire area was then re-peritonized and copious amounts of saline were used to irrigate the pelvic cavity.  Once this was completed, Gelfoam was placed into the cul-de-sac and the O'Connor-O'Sullivan retractor was removed as well as all the wet lap pack.  Edges of the peritoneum were grasped in 3 quadrants with hemostat and a continuous locking stitch of 2-0 Vicryl was used to re-approximate the peritoneum as well as abdominal rectus muscle.  The edges of the fascia were grasped at both corners and a continuous locking stitch of 1 Vicryl was used to re-approximate the fascia with overlapping in the center.  The subcutaneous tissue was irrigated.  Cautery was used to create adequate hemostasis and 3-0 Vicryl was used to re-approximate the tissue and the skin edges were re-approximated with sterile staples.  Sterile dressing was applied and Betadine soaked sponge was removed from the vaginal vault and the vaginal vault was wiped clean of any remaining blood.

The risks included but are not limited to bleeding, infection, nerve damage, failure to heal, possible need for reoperation, possible recurrence, or any associated risk of the anesthesia.  He voiced understanding and agreed to proceed as planned.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: , The patient was identified in the holding area and correct operative site was identified by the surgeon's mark.  Informed consent was obtained.  The patient was then brought to the operating room and transferred to the operating table in supine position.  Time-out was then performed at which point the surgeon, nursing staff, and anesthesia staff all confirmed the correct identification.,After adequate general LMA anesthesia was obtained, a well-padded tourniquet was placed on the patient's right upper arm.  The right upper extremity was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  Planned skin incision was marked along the base of the patient's right palm.  Right upper extremity was then exsanguinated using Esmarch.  The tourniquet was then inflated to 250 mmHg.  Skin incision was then made and dissection was carried down with scalpel to the level of the palmar fascia which was sharply divided by the skin incision.  Bleeding points were identified with electrocautery using bipolar electrocautery.  Retractors were then placed to allow visualization of the distal extent of the transverse carpal ligament, and this was then divided longitudinally under direct vision.  Baby Metzenbaum scissors were used to dissect distal to this area to confirm the absence of any remaining crossing obstructing fibrous band.  Retractors were then replaced proximally to allow visualization of proximal extent of the transverse carpal ligament and the release was continued proximally until complete release was performed.  This was confirmed by visually and palpably.  Next, baby Metzenbaum scissors were used to dissect anteroposterior adjacent antebrachial fascia, and this was divided longitudinally under direct vision using baby Metzenbaum scissors to a level of approximately 3 cm proximal to the proximal extent of the skin incision.  Carpal canal was then inspected.  The median nerve was flattened and injected.  No other abnormalities were noted.  Wounds were then irrigated with normal saline and antibiotic additive.

A 20- French Foley catheter was inserted into the penis and into the bladder and placed to dependent drainage.  The table was then placed in minimal flexed position.  A midline skin incision was then made from the umbilicus to the symphysis pubis.  It was carried down to the anterior rectus fascia into the pelvis proper.  Both obturator fossae were exposed.  Standard bilateral pelvic lymph node dissections were carried out.  The left side was approached first by myself.  The limits of my dissection were from the external iliac vein laterally to the obturator nerve medially, and from the bifurcation of the common iliac vein proximally to Cooper's ligament distally.  Meticulous lymphostasis and hemostasis was obtained using hemoclips and 2-0 silk ligatures.  The obturator nerve was visualized throughout and was not injured.  The right side was carried out by my assistant under my direct and constant supervision.  Again, the obturator nerve was visualized throughout and it was not injured.  Both packets were sent to Pathology where no evidence of carcinoma was found.,My attention was then directed to the prostate itself.  The  endopelvic fascia was opened bilaterally.  Using gentle dissection with a Kitner, I swept the levator muscles off the prostate and exposed the apical portion of the prostate.  A back bleeding control suture of 0 Vicryl was placed at the mid-prostate level.  A sternal wire was then placed behind the dorsal vein complex which was sharply transected.  The proximal and distal portions of this complex were then oversewn with 2-0 Vicryl in a running fashion.  When I was satisfied that hemostasis was complete, my attention was then turned to the neurovascular bundles.,The urethra was then sharply transected and six sutures of 2-0 Monocryl placed at the 1, 3, 5, 7, 9 and 11 o'clock positions.  The prostate was then lifted retrograde in the field and was swept from the anterior surface of the rectum and the posterior layer of Denonvilliers' fascia was incised distally, swept off the rectum and incorporated with the prostate specimen.  The lateral pedicles over the seminal vesicles were then mobilized, hemoclipped and transected.  The seminal vesicles themselves were then mobilized and hemostasis obtained using hemoclips.  Ampullae of the vas were mobilized, hemoclipped and transected.  The bladder neck was then developed using careful blunt and sharp dissection.  The prostate was then transected at the level of the bladder neck and sent for permanent specimen.  The bladder neck was reevaluated and the ureteral orifices were found to be placed well back from the edge.  The bladder neck was reconstructed in standard fashion.  It was closed using a running 2-0 Vicryl.  The mucosa was everted over the edge of the bladder neck using interrupted 3-0 Vicryl suture.  At the end of this portion of the case, the new bladder neck had a stoma-like appearance and would accommodate easily my small finger.  The field was then re-evaluated for hemostasis which was further obtained using hemoclips, Bovie apparatus and 3-0 chromic ligatures.  When I was satisfied that hemostasis was complete, the aforementioned Monocryl sutures were then placed at the corresponding positions in the bladder neck.  A new 20-French Foley catheter was brought in through the urethra into the bladder.  A safety suture of 0 Prolene was brought through the end of this and out through a separate stab wound in the bladder and through the left lateral quadrant.  The table was taken out of flexion and the bladder was then brought into approximation to the urethra and the Monocryl sutures were ligated.  The bladder was then copiously irrigated with sterile water and the anastomosis was found to be watertight.  The pelvis was also copiously irrigated with 2 liters of sterile water.  A 10-French Jackson-Pratt drain was placed in the pelvis and brought out through the right lower quadrant and sutured in place with a 2-0 silk ligature.,The wound was then closed in layers.  The muscle was closed with a running 0 chromic, the fascia with a running 1-0 Vicryl, the subcutaneous tissue with 3-0 plain, and the skin with a running 4-0 Vicryl subcuticular.

The patient began having prodromal symptoms 2 to 3 days prior to presentation.  She was seen on 03/09/2007 and a nonstress test was performed.  This revealed some spontaneous variable-appearing decelerations.  She was given IV hydration.  A biophysical profile was obtained, which provided a score of 0/8 with only a 1 cm fluid pocket found.  Therefore, she was admitted for further fetal monitoring and evaluation.  She had changed her cervix from closed 2 days prior to presentation to 1 cm dilated.  She was having somewhat irregular contractions, but with stronger contractions, continued to have decelerations to 50 to 60 beats per minute.  Due to these findings, a scalp electrode was placed as well as an IUPC for an amnioinfusion.  This relieved the decelerations somewhat.  However, over a period of time with strong contractions, she still had bradycardia 40 to 50 beats per minute and developed a late component on the return of the decelerations.  Due to this finding, it was evident that the fetal state would not support labor in order to accomplish a vaginal delivery.  These findings were reviewed with the patient and recommendation was made for cesarean section delivery.  The risks and benefits of this surgery were reviewed, and knowing these facts, the patient gave informed consent.,PROCEDURE: , The patient was taken to the operating room where her epidural anesthesia was reinforced.  She was prepped and draped in the usual fashion for the procedure.  After adequate epidural level was confirmed, the scalp was utilized to make a transverse incision in the patient's lower abdominal wall.  This incision was carried down to the level of the fascia, which was also transversely incised.  After adequate hemostasis, the fascia was bluntly and sharply separated up from the underlying rectus muscle.  The rectus muscle was separated in midline exposing the peritoneum.  The peritoneum was carefully grasped and elevated with hemostats.  It was entered in an up and down fashion with Metzenbaum scissors.  The bladder blade was placed in the lower pole of the incision to protect the bladder.,The uterus was palpated and inspected.  A thin lower uterine segment was noted.  The vertex presentation was confirmed.  The scalp was then utilized to make a transverse or Kerr incision in the lower uterine wall.  Clear fluid was noted upon entering into the amniotic space.  At 05:27, a term viable female infant was delivered up through the incision.  She had spontaneous respirations.  She was given bulb suctioning for clear fluid.  Her cord was clamped and cut and she was delivered off the field to Dr. X who was attending.  The baby girl was subsequently signed Apgars of 8 at one minute and 9 at five minutes.  Her birth weight was found to be 5 pounds and 5 ounces.,The placenta was manually extracted from the endometrial cavity.  A ring clamp and two Allis clamps were placed around the margin of the uterine incision for hemostasis.  The uterus was delivered up into the operative field.  The endometrial cavity was swiped clean with a moist laparotomy pad.  The uterine incision was then closed in a two-layered fashion with 0 Vicryl suture, the first layer interlocking and the second layer imbricating.  Two additional stitches of 3-0 Vicryl suture were utilized for hemostasis.  The uterine incision was noted to be hemostatic upon closure.  The uterus was rotated forward, normal tubes and ovaries were noted on both sides.  The uterus was then returned to its normal position of the abdominal cavity.  The sponge and instrument count was performed for the first time at this point and found to be correct.  The pelvis and anterior uterine space was then irrigated with saline solution.  It was suctioned dry.  A final check of the uterine incision confirmed hemostasis.  The rectus muscle was stabilized across the midline with two simple stitches of 0 Vicryl suture.  The subcutaneous tissue was then exposed, and the fascia closed with two running lengths of 0 Vicryl suture, beginning in lateral margins and overlapping the midline.  The subcutaneous tissue was then irrigated and inspected.  No active bleeding was noted.  It was closed with a running length of 3-0 plain catgut suture.  The skin was then approximated with surgical steel staples.  The incision was infiltrated with a 0.5% solution of Marcaine local anesthetic.  The incision was cleansed and sterilely dressed.,The patient was transferred to the recovery room in stable condition.  The estimated blood loss through the procedure was 450 mL.  The sponge and instrument counts were performed two more times during closure and found to be correct each time.\",\n",

This is secondary to a motor vehicle accident and it was translated appropriately 1 cm.  Risks and benefits have been conferred with the patient as well as the family, they wish to proceed.  The patient was taken to the operating room for a C1-C3 posterior cervical fusion, instrumentation, open reduction and internal fixation.,OPERATION IN DETAIL: , After appropriate consent was obtained from the patient, the patient was wheeled back to the operating theater room #5.  The patient was placed in the usual supine position and intubated and under general anesthesia without any difficulties.  Spinal cord monitoring was induced.  No changes were seen from the beginning to the end of the case.,Mayfield tongues were placed appropriately.  This was placed in line with the pinna of the ear as well as a cm above the tip of the earlobes.  The patient was subsequently rolled onto the fluoroscopic OSI table in the usual prone position with chest rolls.  The patient's Mayfield tongue was fixated in the usual standard fashion.  The patient was subsequently prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  Midline incision was extended from the base of the skull down to the C4 spinous process.  Full thickness skin fascia developed.  The fascia was incised at midline and the posterior elements at C1, C2, C3, as well as the inferior aspect of the occiput was exposed.  Intraoperative x-ray confirmed the level to be C2.,Translaminar screws were placed at C2 bilaterally.  Trajectory was completed with a hand drill and sounded in all four quadrants to make sure there was no violation of pedicles and once this was done, two 3.5 mm translaminar screws were placed bilaterally at C2.  Good placement was seen both in the AP and lateral planes using fluoroscopy.  Facet screws were then placed at C3.  Using standard technique of Magerl, starting in the inferomedial quadrant 14 mm trajectories in the 25-degree caudad-cephalad direction as well as 25 degrees in the medial lateral direction was made.  This was subsequently sounded in all four quadrants to make sure that there is no elevation of the trajectory.  A 14 x 3.5 mm screws were then placed appropriately.  Lateral masteries at C1 endplate were placed appropriately.  The medial and lateral borders were demarcated with a Penfield.  The great occipital nerve was retracted out the way.  Starting point was made with a high-speed power bur and midline and lateral mass bilaterally.  Using a 20-degree caudad-cephalad trajectory as well as 10-degree lateral-to-medial direction, the trajectory was completed in 8 mm increments, this was subsequently sounded in all four quadrants to make sure that there was no violation of the pedicle wall of the trajectory.  Once this was done, 24 x 3.5 mm smooth Schanz screws were placed appropriately.  Precontoured titanium rods were then placed between the screws at the C1, C2, C3 and casts were placed appropriately.  Once this was done, all end caps were appropriately torqued.  This completed the open reduction and internal fixation of the C2 fracture, which showed perfect alignment.  It must be noted that the reduction was partially performed on the table using lateral fluoroscopy prior to the instrumentation, almost reducing the posterior vertebral margin of the odontoid fracture with the base of the C2 access.  Once the screws were torqued bilaterally, good alignment was seen both in the AP and lateral planes using fluoroscopy, this completed instrumentation as well as open reduction and internal fixation of C2.  The cervical fusion was completed by decorticating the posterior elements of C1, C2, and C3.  Once this was done, the morselized allograft 30 mL of cortical cancellous bone chips with 10 mL of demineralized bone matrix was placed over the decorticated elements.  The fascia was closed using interrupted #1 Vicryl suture figure-of-8.  Superficial drain was placed appropriately.  Good alignment of the instrumentation as well as of the fracture was seen both in the AP and lateral planes.  The subcutaneous tissues were closed using a #2-0 Vicryl suture.  The dermal edges were approximated using staples.  The wound was then dressed sterilely using Bacitracin ointment, Xeroform, 4x4s, and tape, and the drain was connected appropriately.  The patient was subsequently released with a Mayfield contraption and rolled on to the stretcher in the usual supine position.  Mayfield tongues were subsequently released.  No significant bleeding was appreciated.  The patient was subsequently extubated uneventfully and taken back to the recovery room in satisfactory and stable condition.  No complications arose.\",\n",

The patient and mother had seen the testicle in the right hemiscrotum in the past, but the testicle seemed to be sliding.  The testis was identified right at the external inguinal ring.  The testis was unable to be brought down into the scrotal sac.  The patient could have had sliding testicle in the past and now the testis has become undescended as the child has grown.  Options such as watchful waiting and wait for puberty to stimulate the descent of the testicle, HCG stimulation, orchiopexy were discussed.  Risk of anesthesia, bleeding, infection, pain, hernia, etc. were discussed.  The patient and parents understood and wanted to proceed with right orchiopexy and herniorrhaphy.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , The patient was brought to the OR, anesthesia was applied.  The patient was placed in supine position.  The patient was prepped and draped in the inguinal and scrotal area.  After the patient was prepped and draped, an inguinal incision was made on the right side about 1 cm away for the anterior superior iliac spine going towards the external ring over the inguinal canal.  The incision came through the subcutaneous tissue and external oblique fascia was identified.  The external oblique fascia was opened sharply and was taken all the way down towards the external ring.  The ilioinguinal nerve was identified right underneath the external oblique fascia, which was preserved and attention was drawn throughout the entire case to ensure that it was not under any tension or pinched or got hooked in the suture.  After dissecting proximally, the testis was identified in the distal end of the inguinal canal.  The testis was pulled up.  The cremasteric muscle was divided and dissection was carried all the way up to the internal inguinal ring.  There was very small hernia, which was removed and was tied at the base.  PDS suture was used to tie this hernia sac all the way up to the base.  There was a Y right at the vas and cord indicating there was enough length into the scrotal sac.  The testis was easily brought down into the scrotal sac.  One centimeter superior scrotal incision was made and a Dartos pouch was created.  The testicle was brought down into the pouch and was placed into the pouch.  Careful attention was done to ensure that there was no torsion of the cord.  The vas was medial all the way throughout and the cord was lateral all the way throughout.  The epididymis was in the posterolateral location.  The testicle was pexed using 4-0 Vicryl into the scrotal sac.  Skin was closed using 5-0 Monocryl.  The external oblique fascia was closed using 2-0 PDS.  Attention was drawn to re-create the external inguinal ring.  A small finger was easily placed in the external inguinal ring to ensure that there was no tightening of the cord.  Marcaine 0.25% was applied, about 15 mL worth of this was applied for local anesthesia.  After closing the external oblique fascia, the Scarpa was brought together using 4-0 Vicryl and the skin was closed using 5-0 Monocryl in subcuticular fashion.  Dermabond and Steri-Strips were applied.,The patient was brought to recovery room in stable condition at the end of the procedure.,Please note that the testicle was viable.  It was smaller than the other side, probably by 50%.  There were no palpable testicular masses.  Plan was for the patient to follow up with us in about 1 month.  The patient was told not to do any heavy lifting for at least 3 months, okay to shower in 48 hours.  No tub bath for 2 months.  The patient and family understood all the instructions.',\n",

The patient was given Ancef preop antibiotic.  Ancef irrigation was used throughout the procedure.,BRIEF HISTORY: , The patient is a 63-year-old female who presented to us with urgency and frequency on physical exam.  There was no evidence of cystocele or rectocele.  On urodyanamcis, the patient has significant overactivity of the bladder.  The patient was tried on over three to four different anticholinergic agents such as Detrol, Ditropan, Sanctura, and VESIcare for at least one month each.  The patient had pretty much failure from each of the procedure.  The patient had less than 20% improvement with anticholinergics.  Options such as continuously trying anticholinergics, continuation of the Kegel exercises, and trial of InterStim were discussed.  The patient was interested in the trial.  The patient had percutaneous InterStim trial in the office with over 70% to 80% improvement in her urgency, frequency, and urge incontinence.  The patient was significantly satisfied with the results and wanted to proceed with stage I and II neuromodulator.  Risks of anesthesia, bleeding, infection, pain, MI, DVT, and PE were discussed.  Risk of failure of the procedure in the future was discussed.,Risk of lead migration that the treatment may or may not work in the long-term basis and data on the long term were not clear were discussed with the patient.  The patient understood and wanted to proceed with stage I and II neuromodulator.  Consent was obtained.,DETAILS OF THE OPERATION: , The patient was brought to the OR.  The patient was placed in prone position.  A pillow was placed underneath her pelvis area to slightly lift the pelvis up.  The patient was awake, was given some MAC anesthesia through the IV, but the patient was talking and understanding and was able to verbalize issues.  The patient's back was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  Lidocaine 1% was applied on the right side near the S3 foramen.  Under fluoroscopy, the needle placement was confirmed.  The patient felt stimulation in the vaginal area, which was tapping in nature.  The patient also had a pressure feeling in the vaginal area.  The patient had no back sensation or superficial sensation.  There was no sensation down the leg.  The patient did have __________, which turned in slide bellows response indicating the proper positioning of the needle.  A wire was placed.  The tract was dilated and lead was placed.  The patient felt tapping in the vaginal area, which is an indication that the lead is in its proper position.  Most of the leads had very low amplitude and stimulation.  Lead was tunneled under the skin and was brought out through an incision on the left upper buttocks.  Please note that the lidocaine was injected prior to the tunneling.  A pouch was created about 1 cm beneath the subcutaneous tissue over the muscle where the actual unit was connected to the lead.  Screws were turned and they were dropped.  Attention was made to ensure that the lead was all the way in into the InterStim.  Irrigation was performed after placing the main unit in the pouch.  Impedance was checked.  Irrigation was again performed with antibiotic irrigation solution.  The needle site was closed using 4-0 Monocryl.  The pouch was closed using 4-0 Vicryl and the subcutaneous tissue with 4-0 Monocryl.  Dermabond was applied.,The patient was brought to recovery in a stable condition.\",\n",

EMT evaluation revealed him to be in ventricular fibrillation and he was given epinephrine, lidocaine, bretylium and electrically defibrillated and intubated in the field. Upon arrival at a local ER his cardiac rhythm deteriorated and he required more than 9 counter shocks (defibrillation) at 360 joules per shock, epinephrine and lidocaine. This had no effect. He was then given intracardiac epinephrine and a subsequent electrical defibrillation placed him in atrial fibrillation. He was then taken emergently to cardiac catherization and was found to have normal coronary arteries. He was then admitted to an intensive care unit and required intraortic balloon pump pressure support via the right gorin.

She wishes to proceed with arthroplasty at this time.,PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was taken to the Operative Suite at ABCD General Hospital on 09/11/03.  She was placed on the operating table.  Department of Anesthesia administered a spinal anesthetic.  Once adequately anesthetized, the left lower extremity was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  An Esmarch was applied and a tourniquet was inflated to 325 mmHg on the left thigh.  A longitudinal incision was made over the anterior portion of the knee and this was taken down through the subcutaneous tissue to the level of the patella retinaculum.  A medial peripatellar arthrotomy was then made and taken down to the level of the tibial tubercle.  Care was then ensured that the patellar tendon was not violated.  The proximal tibia was then skeletonized both medially and laterally to the level of the axis through the joint line.  Again care was ensured that the patellar tendon was not avulsed from the insertion on the tibia.  The intramedullary canal was then opened using a drill and the anterior sizing guide was then placed.  Rongeur was used to take out any osteophytes and the size of approximately size E. At this point, the epicondyle axis guide was then inserted and aligned in a proper orientation.  The anterior cutting guide was then placed.  Care was checked for the amount of resection that the femur would be notched and the oscillating saw was used to cut the anterior portion of the femur.  After this was performed, this was removed and the distal femoral cutting guide was then placed.  The left knee placed in 5 degrees of valgus, guide was then placed, and a standard distal cut was then taken.  After the cuts were ensured further to be leveled and they were, and we proceeded to place the finishing guide size E and distal femur.  This was placed slightly in lateral position and secured in position with spring tense and head lift tense.  Once adequately secured and placed in the appropriate orientation, the alignment was again verified with the epicondyle axis and appeared to be externally rotated appropriately.  The chamfer cuts and anterior and posterior cuts were then made as well as the notch cut using the reciprocating and oscillating saws.  After this was performed, the guide was removed and all bony fragments were then removed.  Attention was then directed to the tibia.  The external tibial alignment guide was then placed and pinned to the proximal tibia in a proper position.  Care was ensured if it is was a varus or valgus and the appropriate.  The femur gauge was then used to provide us appropriate amount of bony resection.  This was then pinned and secured into place.  Ligament retractors were used to protect the collateral ligaments and the tip proximal tibial cut was then made.  This bony portion was then removed and remaining meniscal fragments were removed as well as the ACL till adequate exposure was obtained.  Trial components were then inserted into position and taken the range of motion and found to have good and full excellent range of motion stability.  The trial components were then removed.  The tibia was then stemmed in standard fashion after the tibial plate was placed in some degree of external rotation with appropriate alignment.  After it was stemmed and broached, these were removed and the patella was then incised, a size 41 patella reamer blade was then used and was taken down, a size 38 patella button was then placed intact.  Again the trial components were placed back into position.  Patella button was placed and the tracking was evaluated.  They tracked centrally with no touch technique.  Again, all components were now removed and the knee was then copiously irrigated and suctioned dry.  Once adequately suctioned dry, the tibial portion was cemented and packed into place.  Also excess cement was removed.  The femoral component was then cemented into position.  All excess cement was removed.  A size 12 poly was then inserted in trial to provide compression at cement adhered.  The patella was then cemented and held into place.  All components were held under compression until cement had adequately adhered all excess cement was then removed.  The knee was then taken through range of motion and size 12 felt to be slightly too big, this was removed and the size 10 trial was replaced, and again had excellent varus and valgus stability with full range of motion and felt to be the articulate surface of choice.  The knee was again copiously irrigated and suctioned dry.  One last check in the posterior aspect of the knee for any loose bony fragments or osteophytes was performed, there were none found and a final articulating surface was impacted and locked into place.  After this, the knee was taken again for final range of motion and found to have excellent position, stability, and good alignment of the components.  The knee was once again copiously irrigated, and the tourniquet was deflated.  Bovie cautery was used to cauterize the knee bleeding that was seen until good hemostasis obtained.  A drain was then placed deep to the retinaculum and the retinaculum repair was performed using #2-0 Ethibond and oversewn with a #1 Vicryl.  This was flexed and the repair was found held securely.  At this point, the knee was again copiously irrigated and suctioned dry.  The subcutaneous tissue was closed with #2-0 Vicryl, and the skin was approximated with skin staples.  Sterile dressing with Adaptic, 4x4s, ABDs, and Kerlix rolls was then applied.  The patient was then transferred back to the gurney in a supine position.,DISPOSITION: , The patient tolerated well with no complications, to PACU in satisfactory condition.',\n",
       " \"HISTORY:  ,The patient is a 5-1/2-year-old with Down syndrome, complex heart disease consisting of atrioventricular septal defect and tetralogy of Fallot with pulmonary atresia, discontinuous pulmonary arteries and bilateral superior vena cava with a left cava draining to the coronary sinus and a right aortic arch.  As an infant, he was initially palliated with the right and modified Blalock-Taussig shunt in October of 2002 and underwent atrioventricular septal defect and repair of pulmonary artery unifocalization and homograft placement between the right ventricle and unifocalized pulmonary arteries.  He developed a significant branch of pulmonary artery stenosis for which on 07/20/2004, he underwent a bilateral balloon pulmonary arterioplasty and stent implantation at the San Diego at Children's Hospital.  This was followed on 09/13/2007 with replacement of pulmonary valve utilizing a 16-mm Contegra valve.  A recent echocardiogram demonstrated a significant branch of pulmonary artery stenosis with the predicted gradient of 41 to 55 mmHg and a well-functioning Contegra valve.  The lung perfusion scan from 11/14/2007 demonstrated 47% flow to the left lung and 53% flow to the right lung.  The patient underwent a repeat catheterization in consideration for further balloon angioplasty of the branch pulmonary arteries.,PROCEDURE: , After sedation, the patient was placed under general endotracheal anesthesia breathing 50% oxygen throughout the case.  The patient was prepped and draped.  Cardiac catheterization was performed as outlined in the attached continuation sheets.  Vascular entry was by percutaneous technique, and the patient was heparinized.  Monitoring during the procedure included continuous surface ECG, continuous pulse oximetry, and cycled cuff blood pressures, in addition to intravascular pressures,Using a 7-French sheath, 6-French wedge catheter was inserted into the right femoral vein and advanced through the right heart structures out to the branch pulmonary arteries.  This catheter was exchanged over wire.  A 5-French marker pigtail catheter was directed into the main pulmonary artery.  A second site of venous access was achieved in and the left femoral vein with the placement of 5-French sheath.,Using a 4-French sheath, a 4-French pigtail catheter was inserted in the right femoral artery and advanced retrograde to the descending aorta, ascending aorta and left ventricle.  Angiogram with injection in the main pulmonary artery demonstrated stable stent configuration of the proximal branch pulmonary arteries with intimal ingrowth in the region of the proximal stents.  The distal right pulmonary measured approximately 10 mm in diameter with a mid stent section measuring 9.4 mm and the proximal stent near the origin of the right pulmonary artery of 5.80 mm.  The distal left pulmonary measured approximately 10 mm in diameter with a mid stent measuring 10.3 mm and the proximal stent near the origin of the left pulmonary artery is 6.8 mm diameter.  The left femoral venous sheath was exchanged over wire for a 7-French sheath.  Guidewires were then advanced through the respective venous sheath into the branch pulmonary arteries and simultaneous balloon pulmonary arterioplasty was performed using the two Z-Med 12 x 4 cm balloon catheter was advanced into the branch of pulmonary arteries and inflated maximally to 9 hemispheres of pressure on 5 occasions near complete disappearance of proximal waist.  The balloon catheter was then exchanged for a 5-French Mistique catheter for pressure pull-back and measurement in the angiogram.  The catheter's wires were then removed and final hemodynamic assessment was made with the wedge catheter.,Flows were calculated by the Fick technique using a measured assumed oxygen consumption and contents derived from Radiometer Hemoximeter saturations and hemoglobin capacity.,Cineangiograms were obtained with angiograph injection in the main pulmonary artery.,After angiography, two normal-appearing renal collecting systems were visualized.  The catheters and sheaths were removed and topical pressure applied for hemostasis.  The patient was returned to the recovery room in satisfactory condition.  There were no complications.,DISCUSSION:  ,Oxygen consumption was assumed to be in normal.  Mixed venous saturation that was not normal with no evidence of intracardiac shunt.  Left side of the heart was mildly desaturated following a part to parenchymal lung disease with the partial pressure of oxygen of only 82 mmHg.  Aphasic right atrial pressures were normal with an A-wave similar to the normal right ventricular end-diastolic pressure.  Left ventricular systolic pressure was moderately elevated at 70% of systemic level and there was no obstruction into the proximal main pulmonary artery.  There was a 20 mmHg of peak systolic gradient across the branch pulmonary artery stents to the distal artery.  Right and left pulmonary artery capillary wedge pressures were normal with an A-wave similar to the mildly elevated left ventricular end-diastolic pressure of 13 mmHg.  Left ventricular systolic pressure was systemic.  No outflow constriction to the ascending aorta.  Phasic ascending and descending pressures were similar and normal.  The calculated systemic and pulmonary flows were equal and normal.  Vascular resistances were normal.  Angiogram with injection in the main pulmonary artery showed catheter induced pulmonary insufficiency, well functioning Contegra valve with no appreciable calcification.  The proximal narrowing of the distal main pulmonary artery was appreciated.  Neointimal ingrowth within the proximal stents were appreciated.  There is good distal growth of the pulmonary arteries.  Arborization appeared normal.  Levophase contrast returned to the heart appeared normal with a well-functioning left ventricle and the right aortic arch.  Following the branch pulmonary artery angioplasty that was increased in the mixed venous saturation, as well as an increase in the systemic arterial saturation.  Right ventricular systolic pressure felt slightly to 40 mmHg with an increase in systemic arterial pressure with a systolic pressure ratio of 54%.  The main pulmonary pressures remained similar.  There was 10 mmHg systolic gradient into the branch of pulmonary arteries.  There is an increase in distal branch of pulmonary arteries with the mean pressure increased from 16 mmHg to 21 mmHg.  Final angiogram with injection in the main pulmonary artery showed a competent Contegra valve.  A brisk flow through the proximal branch stents with the improved caliber of the branch pulmonary artery lumens.  There was no evidence of intimal disruption.,DIAGNOSES: ,1.

The pain has become more and more severe.  It runs to the thumb and index finger of the right hand and it is accompanied by numbness.  If he tilts his neck backwards, the pain shoots down the arm.  If he is working with the computer, it is very difficult to use his mouse.  He tried conservative measures and failed to respond, so he sought out surgery.  Surgery was discussed with him in detail.  A C5-C6 anterior cervical discectomy and fusion was recommended.  He understood and wished to proceed with surgery.  Thus, he was brought in same day for surgery on 07/03/2007.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: , He was given Ancef 1 g intravenously for infection prophylaxis and then transported to the OR.  There general endotracheal anesthesia was induced.  He was positioned on the OR table with an IV bag between the scapulae.  The neck was slightly extended and taped into position.  A metal arch was placed across the neck and intraoperative x-ray was obtain to verify a good position for skin incision and the neck was prepped with Betadine and draped in the usual sterile fashion.,A linear incision was created in the neck beginning just to the right of the midline extending out across the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle.  The incision was extended through skin, subcutaneous fat, and platysma.  Hemostasis was assured with Bovie cautery.  The anterior aspect of the sternocleidomastoid muscle was identified and dissection was carried medial to this down to the carotid sheath.  The trachea and the esophagus were swept out of the way and dissection proceeded medial to the carotid sheath down between the two bellies of the longus colli muscle on to the anterior aspect of the spine.  A Bovie cautery was used to mobilize the longus colli muscle around initially what turned out to be C6-C7 disk based on x-rays and then around the C5-C6 disk space.  An intraoperative x-ray confirmed C5-C6 disk space had been localized and then the self-retained distraction system was inserted to maintain exposure.  A 15-blade knife was used to incise the C5-C6 disk and remove disk material. and distraction pins were inserted into C5-C6 and distraction placed across the disk space.  The operating microscope was then brought into the field and used throughout the case except for the closure.  Various pituitaries, #15 blade knife, and curette were used to evacuate the disk as best as possible.  Then, the Midas Rex drill was taken under the microscope and used to drill where the cartilaginous endplate driven back all the way into the posterior aspect of the vertebral body.  A nerve hook was swept underneath the posterior longitudinal ligament and a fragment of disk was produced and was pulled up through the ligament.  A Kerrison rongeur was used to open up the ligament in this opening and then to march out in the both neural foramina.  A small amount of disk material was found at the right neural foramen.  After a good decompression of both neural foramina was obtained and the thecal sac was exposed throughout the width of the exposure, the wound was thoroughly irrigated.  A spacing mechanism was intact into the disk space and it was determined that a #7 spacer was appropriate.  So, a #7 machine bone implant was taken and tapped into disk space and slightly counter sunk.  The wound was thoroughly irrigated and inspected for hemostasis.  A Mystique plate 23 mm in length was then inserted and anchored to the anterior aspect of C5-C6 to hold the bone into position and the wound was once again irrigated.  The patient was valsalved.  There was no further bleeding seen and intraoperative x-ray confirmed a good position near the bone, plate, and screws and the wound was enclosed in layers.  The 3-0 Vicryl was used to approximate platysma and 3-0 Vicryl was used in inverted interrupted fashion to perform a subcuticular closure of the skin.  The wound was cleaned.,Mastisol was placed on the skin, and Steri-strips were used to approximate skin margins.  Sterile dressing was placed on the patient's neck.  He was extubated in the OR and transported to the recovery room in stable condition.  There were no complications.\",\n",

The right ankle was prepped and draped in standard fashion.  The tourniquet was applied about the right upper thigh.  An Esmarch tourniquet was used to exsanguinate the ankle.  The tourniquet was insufflated to a pressure 325 mm for approximately 59 minutes.  An approximately 6 inch longitudinal incision was made just over the lateral malleolus.  Care was taken to spare overlying nerves and vessels.  An elevator was used to expose the fracture.  The fracture was freed of old hematoma and reduced with a reducing clamp.  An interfragmentary cortical screw was placed of 28 mm with excellent purchase.  The intraoperative image showed excellent reduction.  A 5-hole semitubular plate was then contoured to the lateral malleolus and fixed with 3 cortical screws proximally and 2 cancellous screws distally.  Excellent stability of fracture was achieved.  Final fluoroscopy showed a reduction to be anatomic in 2 planes.  The wound was irrigated with copious amounts of normal saline.  Deep tissue was closed with 2-0 Vicryl.

Apgars 7 and 8 at 1 and 5 minutes respectively.  Weight pending at this time.  His name is Kasson as well as umbilical cord and placenta stained yellow.  Otherwise normal appearing uterus and bilateral tubes and ovaries.,DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION:,  After informed consent was obtained, the patient was taken to the operating room where spinal anesthesia was obtained by Dr. X without difficulties.  The patient was placed in supine position with leftward tilt.  Fetal heart tones were checked and were 140s, and she was prepped and draped in a normal sterile fashion.  At this time, a Pfannenstiel skin incision made with a scalpel and carried down to the underlying fascia with electrocautery.  The fascia was nicked sharply in the midline.  The fascial incision was extended laterally with Mayo scissors.  The inferior aspect of the fascial incision was grasped with Kocher x2, elevated, and rectus muscles dissected sharply with the use of Mayo scissors.  Attention was then turned to the superior aspect of the fascial incision.  Fascia was grasped, elevated, and rectus muscles dissected off sharply.  The rectus muscles were separated in the midline bluntly.  The peritoneum was identified, grasped, and entered sharply and the peritoneal incision extended inferiorly and superiorly with good visualization of bladder.  Bladder blade was inserted.  Vesicouterine peritoneum was tented up and a bladder flap was created using Metzenbaum scissors.  Bladder blade was reinserted to effectively protect the bladder from the operative field and the lower uterine segment incised in a transverse U-shaped fashion with the scalpel.  Uterine incision was extended laterally and manually.  Membranes were ruptured and bright yellow clear amniotic fluid was noted.  Infant's head was in a floating position, able to flex the head, push against the incision, and then easily brought it to the field vertex.  Nares and mouth were suctioned with bulb suction.  Remainder of the infant was delivered atraumatically.  The infant was very pale upon delivery.  Cord was doubly clamped and cut and immediately handed to the awaiting intensive care nursery team.  An 8 cm segment of the tube was doubly clamped and transected.  Cord gases were obtained.  Cord was then cleansed, laid on a clean laparotomy sponge, and cord blood was drawn for hematocrit measurements.  At this time, it was noted that the cord was significantly yellow stained as well as the placenta.  At this time, the placenta was delivered via gentle traction on the cord and exterior uterine massage.  Uterus was exteriorized and cleared off all clots and debris with dry laparotomy sponge and the lower uterine segment was closed with 1-0 chromic in a running locked fashion.  Two areas of oozing were noted and separate figure-of-eight sutures were placed to obtain hemostasis.  At this time, the uterine incision was hemostatic.  The bladder was examined and found to be well below the level of the incision repair.  Tubes and ovaries were examined and found to be normal.  The patient was again asked if she desires permanent sterilization of which she agrees and therefore the right fallopian tube was identified and followed out to the fimbriated end and grasped at the mid portion with a Babcock clamp.  Mesosalpinx was divided with electrocautery and a 4-cm segment of tube was doubly tied and transected with a 3-cm segment of tube removed.  Hemostasis was noted.  Then, attention was turned to the left fallopian tube which in similar fashion was grasped and brought out through the fimbriated end and grasped the midline portion with Babcock clamp.  Mesosalpinx was incised and 3-4 cm tube doubly tied, transected, and excised and excellent hemostasis was noted.  Attention was returned to the uterine incision which is seemed to be hemostatic and uterus was returned to the abdomen.  Gutters were cleared off all clots and debris.  Lower uterine segments were again re-inspected and found to be hemostatic.  Sites of tubal sterilization were also visualized and were hemostatic.  At this time, the peritoneum was grasped with Kelly clamps x3 and closed with running 3-0 Vicryl suture.  Copious irrigation was used.  Rectus muscle belly was examined and found to be hemostatic and tacked and well approximated in the midline.  At this time, the fascia was closed using 0 Vicryl in a running fashion.  Manual palpation confirms thorough and adequate closure of the fascial layer.  Copious irrigation was again used.  Hemostasis noted, and skin was closed with staples.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  Sponge, lap, needle, and instrument counts were correct x3 and the patient was sent to the recovery room awake and stable condition.  Infant assumed the care of the intensive care nursery team and being followed and workup up for isoimmunization and fetal anemia.  The patient will be followed for her severe right upper quadrant pain post delivery.

Dressing was removed from the left eye, which revealed the defect as noted above.  After systemic administration of alfentanil, local anesthetic was infiltrated into the left upper lid, left lateral canthus, and left lower eyelid.  The patient was prepped and draped in the usual ophthalmic fashion.  Protective scleral shell was placed in the left eye.  A 4-0 silk traction sutures placed through the upper eyelid margin.  The medial aspect of the remaining lower eyelid was freshened with straight iris scissors and fibrin was removed from the inferior aspect of the wound.  The eyelid was everted and a tarsoconjunctival pedicle flap was developed by incision of the tarsus approximately 3-1/2-4 mm from the lid margin the full width of the eyelid.  Relaxing incisions were made both medially and laterally and Mueller's muscle was subsequently dissected free from the superior tarsal border.  The tarsoconjunctival pedicle was then anchored to the lateral orbital rim with two interrupted 6-0 Vicryl sutures and one 4-0 Vicryl suture.  The protective scleral shell was removed from the eye.  The medial aspect of the eyelid was advanced temporally.  The tarsoconjunctival pedicle was then cut to size and the tarsus was anchored to the medial aspect of the eyelid with multiple interrupted 6-0 Vicryl sutures.  The conjunctiva and lower lid retractors were attached to the advanced tarsal edge with a running 7-0 Vicryl suture.  The upper eyelid wound was present.  It was advanced to the advanced tarsoconjunctival pedicle temporally.  The conjunctival pedicle was slightly trimmed to make a lateral canthal tendon and the upper eyelid was advanced to the tarsoconjunctival pedicle temporally with an interrupted 6-0 Vicryl suture, it was then secured to the lateral orbital rim with two interrupted 6-0 Vicryl sutures.  Skin muscle flap was then elevated, was draped superiorly and nasally and was anchored to the medial aspect of the eyelid with interrupted 7-0 Vicryl sutures.  Burrows triangle was removed as was necessary to create smooth wound closure, which was closed with interrupted 7-0 Vicryl suture.  Temporally the orbicularis was resuspended from the advanced skin muscle flap with interrupted 6-0 Vicryl suture to the periosteum overlying the lateral orbital rim.  The skin muscle flap was secured to the underlying tarsoconjunctival pedicle with vertical mattress sutures of 7-0 Vicryl followed by wound closure temporally with interrupted 7-0 Vicryl suture with removal of a burrow's triangle as was necessary to create smooth wound closure.  Erythromycin ointment was then applied to the eye and to the wound followed by multiple eye pads with moderate pressure.

Tethered brachial artery, left elbow.,PROCEDURE PERFORMED: , Closed reduction percutaneous pinning, left distal humerus.,SPECIFICATIONS: , The entire operative procedure was done in the inpatient operating suite, room #2 at ABCD General Hospital.  A portion of the procedure was done in consult with Dr. X with separate dictation by him.,HISTORY AND GROSS FINDINGS:  ,This is a 4-year-old white male, apparently dominantly right-handed who suffered a severe injury to his left distal humerus after jumping off of a swing.  He apparently had not had previous problems with his left arm.  He was seen in the Emergency with a grossly deformed left elbow.  His parents' were both present preoperatively.  His x-ray exam as well as physical exam was consistent with a closed type-III supracondylar fracture of the left distal humerus with rather severe puckering of the skin anteriorly with significant ecchymosis in the same region.  Gross neurologic exam revealed his ulnar, median, and radial nerves to be mostly intact, although a complete exam was impossible.  He did have a radial pulse palpable.,PROCEDURE: , After discussing the alternatives of the case as well as advantages and disadvantages, risks, complications, and expectations with the patient's parents including malunion, nonunion, gross deformity, growth arrest, infection, loss of elbow motions, stiffness, instability, need for surgery in the future, nerve problems, artery problems, and compartment syndrome, they elected to proceed.,The patient was laid supine upon operative table after receiving general anesthetic by Anesthesia Department.  Closed reduction was accomplished in a sequential manner.  Milking of the soft tissue envelope was carried out to try and reduce the shaft of the humerus back into its plane relative to the brachialis muscle and the neurovascular bundle anteriorly.  Then a slow longitudinal traction was carried out.  The elbow was hyperflexed.  Pressure placed upon the olecranon tip and two 0.045 K-wires placed first, one being on the lateral side and with this placement on the medial side of medial epicondyle with care taken to protect the ulnar nerve.  The close reduction was deemed to be acceptable once viewed on C-arm.,After this, pulse was attempted to be palpated distally.  Prior to the procedure, I talked to Dr. X of Vascular Surgery at ABCD Hospital.  He had scrubbed in to the case to follow up on the loss of the radial artery distally.  This was not present palpatory, but also by Doppler.  A weak ulnar artery pulse was present via Doppler.  Because of this, the severe displacement of the injury and the fact that the Doppler sound had an occlusion-type sound just above the fracture site or _______.  A long discussion was carried out with Dr. X and myself, and we decided to proceed with exploration of the brachial artery.  Prior to this, I went out to the waiting room to discuss with the patient's parents, the reasoning what we are going to do and the reasoning for this.  I then came back in and then we proceeded.  He was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.  Please see Dr. X's report for the discussion of the exploration and release of the brachial artery.  There was no indication that it was actually in the fracture site, the soft tissue had tethered in its right angle towards the fracture site, thus reducing its efficiency of providing blood distally.  Once it was released, both clinically on the table as well as by Doppler, the patient had bounding pulses.,We then proceeded to close utilizing a #4-0 Vicryl for subcutaneous fat closure and a running #5-0 Vicryl subcuticular stitch for skin closure.  Steri-Strips were placed.  The patient's arm was placed in just a slight degree of flexion with a neutral position.  He was splinted posteriorly.  Adaptic and fluffs have been placed around the patient's pin sites.  K-wires have been bent, cut, and pin caps placed.,Expected surgical prognosis on this patient is guarded for the obvious reasons noted above.  There is concern for growth plate disturbance.  He will be watched very closely for the potential development of re-perfusing compartment syndrome.,A full and complete neurologic exam will be impossible tonight, but will be carried on a sequential basis starting tomorrow morning.  There is always a potential for loss of elbow motion, overall cosmetic elbow alignment, and elbow function.\",\n",

       " \"REASON FOR NEUROLOGICAL CONSULTATION: , Cervical spondylosis and kyphotic deformity.  The patient was seen in conjunction with medical resident Dr. X. I personally obtained the history, performed examination, and generated the impression and plan.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: ,The patient is a 45-year-old African-American female whose symptoms first started some one and a half years ago with pain in the left shoulder and some neck pain.  This has subsequently resolved.  She started vigorous workouts in November 2005.  In March of this year, she suddenly could not feel her right foot on the bathroom floor and subsequently went to her primary care physician.  By her report, she had a nerve conduction study and a diagnosis of radiculopathy was made.  She had an MRI of lumbosacral spine, which was within normal limits.  She then developed a tingling sensation in the right middle toe.  Symptoms progressed to sensory symptoms of her knees, elbows, and left middle toe.  She then started getting sensory sensations in the left hand and arm.  She states that she feels a little bit wobbly at the knees and that she is slightly dragging her left leg.  Symptoms have been mildly progressive.  She is unaware of any trigger other than the vigorous workouts as mentioned above.  She has no associated bowel or bladder symptoms.  No particular position relieves her symptoms.,Workup has included two MRIs of the C-spine, which were personally reviewed and are discussed below.  She saw you for consultation and the possibility of surgical decompression was raised.  At this time, she is somewhat reluctant to go through any surgical procedure.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:,1.  Ocular migraines.,2.  Myomectomy.,3.  Infertility.,4.  Hyperglycemia.,5.  Asthma.,6.  Hypercholesterolemia.,MEDICATIONS: , Lipitor, Pulmicort, Allegra, Xopenex, Patanol, Duac topical gel, Loprox cream, and Rhinocort.,ALLERGIES: , Penicillin and aspirin.,Family history, social history, and review of systems are discussed above as well as documented in the new patient information sheet.  Of note, she does not drink or smoke.  She is married with two adopted children.  She is a paralegal specialist.  She used to exercise vigorously, but of late has been advised to stop exercising and is currently only walking.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: , She does complain of mild blurred vision, but these have occurred before and seem associated with headaches.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: , On examination, blood pressure 138/82, pulse 90, respiratory rate 14, and weight 176.5 pounds.  Pain scale is 0.  A full general and neurological examination was personally performed and is documented on the chart.  Of note, she has a normal general examination.  Neurological examination reveals normal cognition and cranial nerve examination including normal jaw jerk.  She has mild postural tremor in both arms.  She has mild decreased sensation in the right palm and mild decreased light touch in the right palm and decreased vibration sense in both distal lower extremities.  Motor examination reveals no weakness to individual muscle testing, but on gait she does have a very subtle left hemiparesis.  She has hyperreflexia in her lower extremities, worse on the left.  Babinski's are downgoing.,PERTINENT DATA:  ,MRI of the brain from 05/02/06 and MRI of the C-spine from 05/02/06 and 07/25/06 were personally reviewed.  MRI of the brain is broadly within normal limits.  MRI of the C-spine reveals large central disc herniation at C6-C7 with evidence of mild cord compression and abnormal signal in the cord suggesting cord edema.  There is also a fairly large disc at C3-C4 with cord deformity and partial effacement of the subarachnoid space.  I do not appreciate any cord edema at this level.,IMPRESSION AND PLAN:  ,The patient is a 45-year-old female with cervical spondylosis with a large C6-C7 herniated disc with mild cord compression and signal change at that level.  She has a small disc at C3-C4 with less severe and only subtle cord compression.  History and examination are consistent with signs of a myelopathy.,Results were discussed with the patient and her mother.  I am concerned about progressive symptoms.  Although she only has subtle symptoms now, we made her aware that with progression of this process, she may have paralysis.  If she is involved in any type of trauma to the neck such as motor vehicle accident, she could have an acute paralysis.  I strongly recommended to her and her mother that she followup with you as soon as possible for surgical evaluation.  I agree with the previous physicians who have told her not to exercise as I am sure that her vigorous workouts and weight training since November 2005 have contributed to this problem.  I have recommended that she wear a hard collar while driving.  The results of my consultation were discussed with you telephonically.\",\n",

The patient received 10 ml of 0.5% Marcaine local anesthetic.,TOURNIQUET TIME: , 80 minutes.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:,  Minimal.,DRAINS: , One JP drain was placed.,COMPLICATIONS: , No intraoperative complications or specimens.  Hardware consisted of two 4-5 K-wires, One 6.5, 60 mm partially threaded cancellous screw and one 45, 60 mm partially threaded cortical screw and 2 washers.,HISTORY AND PHYSICAL:,  The patient is a 14-year-old male who reported having knee pain for 1 month.  Apparently while he was playing basketball on 12/22/2007 when he had gone up for a jump, he felt a pop in his knee.  The patient was seen at an outside facility where he was splinted and subsequently referred to Children's for definitive care.  Radiographs confirmed comminuted tibial tubercle avulsion fracture with patella alta.  Surgery is recommended to the grandmother and subsequently to the father by phone.  Surgery would consist of open reduction and internal fixation with subsequent need for later hardware removal.  Risks of surgery include the risks of  anesthesia, infection, bleeding, changes on sensation in most of the extremity, hardware failure, need for later hardware removal, failure to restore extensor mechanism tension, and need for postoperative rehab.  All questions were answered, and father and grandmother agreed to the above plan.,PROCEDURE: , The patient was taken to the operating and placed supine on the operating table.  General anesthesia was then administered.  The patient was given Ancef preoperatively.  A nonsterile tourniquet was placed on the upper aspect of the patient's left thigh.  The patient's extremity was then prepped and draped in the standard surgical fashion.  Midline incision was marked on the skin extending from the tibial tubercle proximally and extremities wrapped in Esmarch.  Finally, the patient had tourniquet that turned in 75 mmHg.  Esmarch was then removed.  The incision was then made.  The patient had significant  tearing of the posterior retinaculum medially with proximal migration of the tibial tubercle which was located in the joint there was a significant comminution and intraarticular involvement.  We were able to see the underside of the anterior horn of both medial and lateral meniscus.  The intraarticular cartilage was restored using two 45 K-wires.  Final position was checked via fluoroscopy and the corners were buried in the cartilage.  There was a large free floating metaphyseal piece that included parts of proximal tibial physis.  This was placed back in an anatomic location and fixed using a 45 cortical screw with a washer.  The avulsed fragment with the patellar tendon was then fixed distally to this area using a 6.5, 60 mm cancellous screw with a washer.  The cortical screw did not provide good compression and fixation at this distal fragment.  Retinaculum was repaired using 0 Vicryl suture as best as possible.  The hematoma was evacuated at the beginning of the case as well as the end.  The knee was copiously irrigated with normal saline.  The subcutaneous tissue was re-approximated using 2-0 Vicryl and the skin with 4-0 Monocryl.  The wound was cleaned, dried, and dressed with Steri-Strips, Xeroform, and 4 x4s.  Tourniquet was released at 80 minutes.  JP drain was placed on the medium gutter.  The extremity was then wrapped in Ace wrap from the proximal thigh down to the toes.  The patient was then placed in a knee mobilizer.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  Subsequently extubated and taken to the recovery in stable condition.,POSTOP PLAN:  ,The patient hospitalized overnight to decrease swelling and as well as manage his pain.  He may weightbear as tolerated using knee mobilizer.  Postoperative findings relayed to the grandmother.  The patient will need subsequent hardware removal.  The patient also was given local anesthetic at the end of the case.\",\n",

A C5-C7 anterior cervical plate fixation (Sofamor Danek titanium window plate) intraoperative fluoroscopy used and intraoperative microscopy used.  Intraoperative SSEP and EMG monitoring used.,ANESTHESIA: , General endotracheal.,COMPLICATIONS:,  None.,INDICATION FOR THE PROCEDURE: , This lady presented with history of cervical pain associated with cervical radiculopathy with cervical and left arm pain, numbness, weakness, with MRI showing significant disk protrusions with the associate complexes at C5-C6 and C6-C7 with associated cervical radiculopathy.  After failure of conservative treatment, this patient elected to undergo surgery.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was brought to the OR and after adequate general endotracheal anesthesia, she was placed supine on the OR table with the head of the bed about 10 degrees.  A shoulder roll was placed and the head supported on a donut support.  The cervical region was prepped and draped in the standard fashion.  A transverse cervical incision was made from the midline, which was lateral to the medial edge of the sternocleidomastoid two fingerbreadths above the right clavicle.  In a transverse fashion, the incision was taken down through the skin and subcutaneous tissue and through the platysmata and a subplatysmal dissection done.  Then, the dissection continued medial to the sternocleidomastoid muscle and then medial to the carotid artery to the prevertebral fascia, which was gently dissected and released superiorly and inferiorly.  Spinal needles were placed into the displaced C5-C6 and C6-C7 to confirm these disk levels using lateral fluoroscopy.  Following this, monopolar coagulation was used to dissect the medial edge of the longus colli muscles off the adjacent vertebrae between C5-C7 and then the Trimline retractors were placed to retract the longus colli muscles laterally and blunt retractors were placed superiorly and inferiorly.  A #15 scalpel was used to do a discectomy at C5-C6 from endplate-to-endplate and uncovertebral joint.  On the uncovertebral joint, a pituitary rongeur was used to empty out any disk material ____________ to further remove the disk material down to the posterior aspect.  This was done under the microscope.  A high-speed drill under the microscope was used to drill down the endplates to the posterior aspect of the annulus.  A blunt trocar was passed underneath the posterior longitudinal ligament and it was gently released using the #15 scalpel and then Kerrison punches 1-mm and then 2-mm were used to decompress further disk calcified material at the C5-C6 level.  This was done bilaterally to allow good decompression of the thecal sac and adjacent neuroforamen.  Then, at the C6-C7 level, in a similar fashion, #15 blade was used to do a discectomy from uncovertebral joint to uncovertebral joint and from endplate-to-endplate using a #15 scalpel to enter the disk space and then the curette was then used to remove the disk calcified material in the endplate, and then high-speed drill under the microscope was used to drill down the disk space down to the posterior aspect of the annulus where a blunt trocar was passed underneath the posterior longitudinal ligament which was gently released.  Then using the Kerrison punches, we used 1-mm and 2-mm, to remove disk calcified material, which was extending more posteriorly to the left and the right.  This was gently removed and decompressed to allow good decompression of the thecal sac and adjacent nerve roots.  With this done, the wound was irrigated.  Hemostasis was ensured with bipolar coagulation.  Vertebral body distraction pins were then placed to the vertebral body of C5 and C7 for vertebral distraction and then a 6-mm allograft performed grafts were taken and packed in either aspect with demineralized bone matrix and this was tapped in flush with the vertebral bodies above and below C5-C6 and C6-C7 discectomy sites.  Then, the vertebral body distraction pins were gently removed to allow for graft seating and compression and then the anterior cervical plate (Danek windows titanium plates) was then taken and sized and placed.  A temporary pin was initially used to align the plate and then keeping the position and then two screw holes were drilled in the vertebral body of C5, two in the vertebral body of C6, and two in the vertebral body of C7.  The holes were then drilled and after this self-tapping screws were placed into the vertebral body of C5, C6, and C7 across the plate to allow the plate to fit and stay flush with the vertebral body between C5, C6, and C7.  With this done, operative fluoroscopy was used to check good alignment of the graft, screw, and plate, and then the wound was irrigated.  Hemostasis was ensured with bipolar coagulation and then the locking screws were tightened down.  A #10 round Jackson-Pratt drain was placed into the prevertebral space and brought out from a separate stab wound skin incision site.  Then, the platysma was approximated using 2-0 Vicryl inverted interrupted stitches and the skin closed with 4-0 Vicryl running subcuticular stitch.  Steri-Strips and sterile dressings were applied.  The patient remained hemodynamically stable throughout the procedure.  Throughout the procedure, the microscope had been used for the disk decompression and high-speed drilling.  In addition, intraoperative SSEP, EMG monitoring, and motor-evoked potentials remained stable throughout the procedure.  The patient remained stable throughout the procedure.',\n",

       " 'PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome with hypertrophy of tonsils and of uvula and soft palate.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome with hypertrophy of tonsils and of uvula and soft palate with deviation of nasal septum.,OPERATION:,  Tonsillectomy, uvulopalatopharyngoplasty, and septoplasty.,ANESTHESIA:,  General anesthetics.,HISTORY: , This is a 51-year-old gentleman here with his wife.  She confirms the history of loud snoring at night with witnessed apnea.  The result of the sleep study was reviewed.  This showed moderate sleep apnea with significant desaturation.  The patient was unable to tolerate treatment with CPAP.  At the office, we observed large tonsils and elongation and thickening of the uvula as well as redundant soft tissue of the palate.  A tortuous appearance of the septum also was observed.  This morning, I talked to the patient and his wife about the findings.  I reviewed the CT images.  He has no history of sinus infections and does not recall a history of nasal trauma.  We discussed the removal of tonsils and uvula and soft palate tissue and the hope that this would help with his airway.  Depending on the findings of surgery, I explained that I might remove that bone spur that we are seeing within the nasal passage.  I will get the best look at it when he is asleep.  We discussed recovery as well.  He visited with Dr. XYZ about the anesthetic produce.,PROCEDURE:,:  General tracheal anesthetic was administered by Dr. XYZ and Mr. Radke.  Afrin drops were placed in both nostrils and a cottonoid soaked with Afrin was placed in each side of the nose.  A Crowe-Davis mouth gag was placed.  The tonsils were very large and touched the uvula.  The uvula was relatively long and very thick and there were redundant folds of soft palate mucosa and prominent posterior and anterior tonsillar pillars.  Also, there was a cryptic appearance of the tonsils but there was no acute redness or exudate.  Retraction of the soft palate permitted evaluation of the nasopharynx with the mirror and the choanae were patent and there was no adenoid tissue present.  A very crowded pharynx was appreciated.  The tonsils were first removed using electrodissection technique.  Hemostasis was achieved with the electrocautery and with sutures of 0 plain catgut.  The tonsil fossae were injected with 0.25% Marcaine with 1:200,000 epinephrine.  There already was more room in the pharynx, but the posterior pharyngeal wall was still obscured by the soft palate and uvula.  The uvula was grasped with the Alice clamp.  I palpated the posterior edge of the hard palate and calculated removal of about a third of the length of the soft palate.  We switched over from the Bayonet cautery to the blunt needle tip electrocautery.  The planned anterior soft palate incision was marked out with the electrocautery from the left anterior tonsillar pillar rising upwards and then extending horizontally across the soft palate to include all of the uvula and a portion of the soft palate, and the incision then extended across the midline and then inferiorly to meet the right anterior tonsillar pillar.  This incision was then deepened with the electrocautery on a cutting current.  The uvular artery just to the right of the midline was controlled with the suction electrocautery.  The posterior soft palate incision was made parallel to the anterior soft palate incision but was made leaving a longer length of mucosa to permit closure of the palatoplasty.  A portion of the redundant soft palate mucosa tissue also was included with the resection specimen and the tissue including the soft palate and uvula was included with the surgical specimen as the tonsils were sent to pathology.  The tonsil fossae were injected with 0.25% Marcaine with 1:200,000 epinephrine.  The soft palate was also injected with 0.25% Marcaine with 1:200,000 epinephrine.  The posterior tonsillar pillars were then brought forward to close to the anterior tonsillar pillars and these were sutured down to the tonsil bed with interrupted 0 plain catgut sutures.  The posterior soft palate mucosa was advanced forward and brought up to the anterior soft palate incision and closure of the soft palate wound was then accomplished with interrupted 3-0 chromic catgut sutures.  A much improved appearance of the oropharynx with a greatly improved airway was appreciated.  A moist tonsil sponge was placed into the nasopharynx and the mouth gag was removed.  I removed the cottonoids from both nostrils.  Speculum exam showed the inferior turbinates were large, the septum was tortuous and it angulated to the right and then sharply bent back to the left.  The septum was injected with 0.25% Marcaine with 1:200,000 epinephrine using a separate syringe and needle.  A #15 blade was used to make a left cheilion incision.,Mucoperichondrium and mucoperiosteum were elevated with the Cottle elevator.  When we reached the deflected portion of the vomer, this was separated from the septal cartilage with a Freer elevator.  The right-sided mucoperiosteum was elevated with the Freer elevator and then with Takahashi forceps and with the 4 mm osteotome, the deflected portion of the septal bone from the vomer was resected.  This tissue also was sent as a separate specimen to pathology.  The intraseptal space was irrigated with saline and suctioned.  The nasal septal mucosal flaps were then sutured together with a quilting suture of 4-0 plain catgut.  I observed no evidence of purulent secretion or polyp formation within the nostrils.  The inferior turbinates were then both outfractured using a knife handle, and now there was a much more patent nasal airway on both sides.  There was good support for the nasal tip and the dorsum and there was good hemostasis within the nose.  No packing was used in the nostrils.  Polysporin ointment was introduced into both nostrils.  The mouth gag was reintroduced and the pack removed from the nasopharynx.  The nose and throat were irrigated with saline and suctioned.  An orogastric tube was placed and a moderate amount of clear fluid suctioned from the stomach and this tube was removed.  Sponge and needle count were reported correct.  The mouth gag having been withdrawn, the patient was then awakened and returned to recovery room in a satisfactory condition.  He tolerated the operation excellently.  Estimated blood loss was about 15-20 cc.  In the recovery room, I observed that he was moving air well and I spoke with his wife about the findings of surgery.',\n",

He had previous lumbar laminectomy at L4-L5.  He was noted to have an isthmic spondylolisthesis.,Previous lumbar laminectomy exacerbated this condition and made it further unstable.  He is suffering from neurogenic claudication.  He was unresponsive to extensive conservative treatment.  He has understanding of the risks, benefits, potential complications, treatment alternatives and provided informed consent.,OPERATIVE TECHNIQUE: , The patient was taken to OR #5 where he was given general anesthetic by the Department of Anesthesia.  He was subsequently placed prone on the Jackson's spinal table with all bony prominences well padded.  His lumbar spine was then sterilely prepped and draped in the usual fashion.  A previous midline incision was extended from approximate level of L3 to S1.  This was in the midline.  Skin and subcutaneous tissue were debrided sharply.  Electrocautery provided hemostasis.  ,Electrocautery was utilized to dissect through subcutaneous tissue of lumbar fascia.  The lumbar fascia was identified and split in the midline.  Subperiosteal dissection was then carried out with electrocautery and ______ elevated from the suspected levels of L3-S1.  Once this was exposed, the transverse processes, a Kocher clamp was placed and a localizing cross-table x-ray confirmed the interspace between the spinous processes of L3-L4.  Once this was completed, a self-retaining retractor was then placed.  With palpation of the spinous processes, the L4 posterior elements were noted to be significantly loosened and unstable.  These were readily mobile with digital palpation.  A rongeur was then utilized to resect the spinous processes from the inferior half of L3 to the superior half of S1.  This bone was morcellized and placed on the back table for utilization for bone grafting.  The rongeur was also utilized to thin the laminas from the inferior half of L3 to superior half of S1.  Once this was undertaken, the unstable posterior elements of L4 were meticulously dissected free until wide decompression was obtained.  Additional decompression was extended from the level of the inferior half of L3 to the superior half of S1.  The microscope was utilized during this portion of procedure for visualization.  There was noted to be no changes during the decompression portion or throughout the remainder of the surgical procedure.  Once decompression was deemed satisfactory, the nerve roots were individually inspected and due to the unstable spondylolisthesis, there was noted to be tension on the L4 and L5 nerve roots crossing the disc space at L4-L5.  Once this was identified, foraminotomies were created to allow additional mobility.  The wound was then copiously irrigated with antibiotic solution and suctioned dry.  Working type screws, provisional titanium screws were then placed at L4-l5.  This was to allow distraction and reduction of the spondylolisthesis.  These were placed in the pedicles of L4 and L5 under direct intensification.  The position of the screws were visualized, both AP and lateral images.  They were deemed satisfactory.,Once this was completed, a provisional plate was applied to the screws and distraction applied across L4-L5.  This allowed for additional decompression of the L5 and L4 nerve roots.  Once this was completed, the L5 nerve root was traced and deemed satisfactory exiting neural foramen after additional dissection and discectomy were performed.  Utilizing a series of interbody spacers, a size 8 mm spacer was placed within the L4-L5 interval.  This was taken in sequence up to a 13 mm space.  This was then reduced to a 11 mm as it was much more anatomic in nature.  Once this was completed, the spacers were then placed on the left side and distraction obtained.  Once the distraction was obtained to 11 mm, the interbody shavers were utilized to decorticate the interbody portion of L4 and L5 bilaterally.  Once this was taken to 11 mm bilaterally, the wound was copiously irrigated with antibiotic solution and suction dried.  A 11 mm height x 9 mm width x 25 mm length carbon fiber cages were packed with local bone graft and Allograft.  There were impacted at the interspace of L4-L5 under direct image intensification.  Once these were deemed satisfactory, the wound was copiously irrigated with antibiotic solution and suction dried.  The provisional screws and plates were removed.  This allowed for additional compression along L4-L5 with the cage instrumentation.  Permanent screws were then placed at L4, L5, and S1 bilaterally.  This was performed under direct image intensification.  The position was verified in both AP and lateral images.  Once this was completed, the posterolateral gutters were decorticated with an AM2 Midas Rex burr down to bleeding subchondral bone.  The wound was then copiously irrigated with antibiotic solution and suction dried.  The morcellized Allograft and local bone graft were mixed and packed copiously from the transverse processes of L4-S1 bilaterally.  A 0.25 inch titanium rod was contoured of appropriate length to span from L4-S1.  Appropriate cross connecters were applied and the construct was placed over the pedicle screws.  They were tightened and sequenced to allow additional posterior reduction of the L4 vertebra.  Once this was completed, final images in the image intensification unit were reviewed and were deemed satisfactory.  All connections were tightened and retightened in Torque 2 specifications.  The wound was then copiously irrigated with antibiotic solution and suction dried.  The dura was inspected and noted to be free of tension.  At the conclusion of the procedure, there was noted to be no changes on the SSEP, EMG, and neurophysiologic monitors.  An 8-inch Hemovac drain was placed exiting the wound.  The lumbar fascia was then approximated with #1 Vicryl in interrupted fashion, the subcutaneous tissue with #2-0 Vicryl interrupted fashion, surgical stainless steel clips were used to approximate the skin.  The remainder of the Hemovac was assembled.  Bulky compression dressing utilizing Adaptic, 4x4, and ABDs was then affixed to the lumbar spine with Microfoam tape.  He was turned and taken to the recovery room in apparent satisfactory condition.  Expected surgical prognosis remains guarded.\",\n",

Coronary artery bypass grafting x3 utilizing left internal mammary artery to left anterior descending, and reverse autogenous saphenous vein graft to the obtuse marginal, posterior descending branch of the right coronary artery.  Total cardiopulmonary bypass,cold blood potassium cardioplegia, antegrade and retrograde, for myocardial protection, placement of temporary pacing wires.,DESCRIPTION:,  The patient was brought to the operating room, placed in supine position.  Adequate general endotracheal anesthesia was induced.  Appropriate monitoring lines were placed.  The chest, abdomen and legs were prepped and draped in a sterile fashion.  The greater saphenous vein was harvested from the right upper leg through interrupted skin incisions and was prepared by ligating all branches with 4-0 silk and flushing with vein solution.  The leg was closed with running 3-0 Dexon subcu, and running 4-0 Dexon subcuticular on the skin, and later wrapped.  A median sternotomy incision was made and the left internal mammary artery was dissected free from its takeoff at the subclavian to its bifurcation at the diaphragm and surrounded with papaverine-soaked gauze.  The sternum was closed.  A right carotid incision was made along the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle and carried down to and through the platysma.  The deep fascia was divided.  The facial vein was divided between clamps and tied with 2-0 silk.  The common carotid artery, takeoff of the external and internal carotid arteries were dissected free, with care taken to identify and preserve the hypoglossal and vagus nerves.  The common carotid artery was double-looped with umbilical tape, takeoff of the external was looped with a heavy silk, distal internal was double-looped with a heavy silk.  Shunts were prepared.  A patch was prepared.  Heparin 50 mg was given IV.  Clamp was placed on the beginning of the takeoff of the external and the proximal common carotid artery.  Distal internal was held with a forceps.  Internal carotid artery was opened with 11-blade.  Potts scissors were then used to extend the aortotomy through the lesion into good internal carotid artery beyond.  The shunt was placed and proximal and distal snares were tightened.  Endarterectomy was carried out under direct vision in the common carotid artery and the internal reaching a fine, feathery distal edge using eversion on the external.  All loose debris was removed and Dacron patch was then sutured in place with running 6-0 Prolene suture, removing the shunt just prior to completing the suture line.  Suture line was completed and the neck was packed.,The pericardium was opened.  A pericardial cradle was created.  The patient was heparinized for cardiopulmonary bypass, cannulated with a single aortic and single venous cannula.  A retrograde cardioplegia cannula was placed with a pursestring of 4-0 Prolene into the coronary sinus, and secured to a Rumel tourniquet.  An antegrade cardioplegia needle sump was placed in the ascending aorta and cardiopulmonary bypass was instituted.  The ascending aorta was cross-clamped and cold blood potassium cardioplegia was given antegrade, a total of 5 cc per kg.  This was followed sumping of the ascending aorta and retrograde cardioplegia, a total of 5 cc per kg to the coronary sinus.  The obtuse marginal 1 coronary was identified and opened, and an end-to-side anastomosis was then performed with running 7-0 Prolene suture.  The vein was cut to length.  Antegrade and retrograde cold blood potassium cardioplegia was given.  The obtuse marginal 2 was not felt to be suitable for bypass, therefore, the posterior descending of the right coronary was identified and opened, and an end-to-side anastomosis was then performed with running 7-0 Prolene suture to reverse autogenous saphenous vein.  The vein was cut to length.  The mammary was clipped distally, divided and spatulated for anastomosis.  Antegrade and retrograde cold blood potassium cardioplegia was given.  The anterior descending was identified and opened. the mammary was then sutured to this with running 8-0 Prolene suture.  Warm blood potassium cardioplegia was given, and the cross-clamp was removed.  A partial-occlusion clamp was placed.  Two aortotomies were made.  The veins were cut to fit these and sutured in place with running 5-0 Prolene suture.  The partial- occlusion clamp was removed.  All anastomoses were inspected and noted to be patent and dry.  Atrial and ventricular pacing wires were placed.  Ventilation was commenced.  The patient was fully warmed.  The patient was weaned from cardiopulmonary bypass and de-cannulated in a routine fashion.  Protamine was given.  Good hemostasis was noted.  A single mediastinal chest tube and bilateral pleural Blake drains were placed.  The sternum was closed with figure-of-eight stainless steel wire, the linea alba with figure-of-eight #1 Vicryl, the sternal fascia with running #1 Vicryl, the subcu with running 2-0 Dexon and the skin with a running 4-0 Dexon subcuticular stitch.',\n",

A time-out process had been followed and then the flexible bronchoscope was inserted through the endotracheal tube after 2 cc of 4% lidocaine had been infused into the endotracheal tube.  First the trachea and the carina had normal appearance.  The scope was passed into the left side and the bronchial system was found to be normal.  There were scars and mucoid secretions.  Then the scope was passed into the right side where brown secretions were obtained and collected in a trap to be sent for culture and sensitivity of aerobic and anaerobic fungi and TB.  First, the basal lobes were explored and found to be normal.  Then, the right upper lobe was selectively cannulated and no abnormalities were found except some secretions were aspirated.  Then, the bronchi going to the three segments were visualized and no abnormalities or mass were found.  Brush biopsy was obtained from one of the segments and sent to Pathology.,The procedure had to be interrupted several times because of the patient's desaturation, but after a few minutes of Ambu bagging, he recovered satisfactorily.,At the end, the patient tolerated the procedure well and was sent to the recovery room in satisfactory condition.,\",\n",

Intraoperatively, the bladder appeared normal with the exception of some minor trabeculations.  The ureteral orifices were normal bilaterally.,DESCRIPTION OF OPERATIVE PROCEDURE:,  This patient was brought to the operating room, a general anesthetic was administered.  She was placed in dorsal lithotomy position.  Her vulva, vagina, and perineum were prepped with Betadine scrubbed in solution.  She was draped in usual sterile fashion.  A Sims retractor was placed into the vagina and Foley catheter was inserted into the bladder.  Two Allis clamps were placed over the mid urethra.  This area was injected with 0.50% lidocaine containing 1:200,000 epinephrine solution.  Two areas suprapubically on either side of midline were injected with the same anesthetic solution.  The stab wound incisions were made in these locations and a sagittal incision was made over the mid urethra.  Metzenbaum scissors were used to dissect bilaterally to the level of the ischial pubic ramus.  The SPARC needles were then placed through the suprapubic incisions and then directed through the vaginal incision bilaterally.  The Foley catheter was removed.  A cystoscopy was performed using a 70-degree cystoscope.  There was noted to be no violation of the bladder.  The SPARC mesh was then snapped onto the needles, which were withdrawn through the stab wound incisions.  The mesh was snugged up against a Mayo scissor held under the mid urethra.  The overlying plastic sheaths were removed.  The mesh was cut below the surface of the skin.  The skin was closed with 4-0 Plain suture.

Arthroscopy of the arthroscopic glenoid labrum.,2.  Rotator cuff debridement shaving glenoid and humeral head.,3.  Biceps tenotomy, right shoulder.,SPECIFICATION: , The entire operative procedure was done in Inpatient Operating Suite, room #1 at ABCD General Hospital.  This was done under interscalene block anesthetic in the modified beachchair position.,HISTORY AND GROSS FINDINGS: , This is a 61-year-old white male who is dominantly right-handed.  He had increasing right shoulder pain and dysfunction for a number of years prior to surgical intervention.  This was gradually done over a period of time.  No specific accident or injury could be seen or pointed.  He was refractory to conservative outpatient therapy.  After discussing alternatives of the care as well as the advantages, disadvantages, risks, complications, and expectations, he elected to undergo the above-stated procedure on this date.,Preoperatively, the patient did not have limitation of motion.  He had gross weakness to his supraspinatus, mildly to the infraspinatus and subscapularis upon strength testing prior to his anesthetic.,Intraarticularly, the patient had an 80% biceps tendon tear that was dislocated.  His rotator interval was resolved as well as his subscapularis with tearing.  The supraspinatus was completely torn, retracted back beyond the level of the labrum and approximately one-third or so of the infraspinatus was involved with the remaining portion being greatly thinned as far as we could observe.  Glenoid labrum had degenerative tear in the inferior surface.  Gross chondromalacia was present to approximately 50% of the humeral head and approximately the upper 40% of the glenoid surface.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE: , The patient was laid supine upon the operative table.  After receiving interscalene block anesthetic by the Anesthesia Department, he was safely placed in a modified beachchair position.  He was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.  The portals were created outside the end posteriorly and then anteriorly.  A full and complete diagnostic arthroscopy was carried out with the above-noted findings.  The shaver was placed anteriorly.  Debridement was carried out to the glenoid labrum tear and the last 20% of the biceps tendon tear was completed.  Debridement was carried out to the end or attachment of the bicep itself.,Debridement was carried out to what could be seen of the remaining rotator cuff there, but then the scope was redirected in a subacromial direction and gross bursectomy carried out.  Debridement was then carried out to the rotator cuff remaining tendon near the tuberosity.  No osteophytes were present.  Because of the massive nature of the tear, the CA ligament was maintained and there were no substantial changes to the subacromial region to necessitate burring.  There was concern because of instability that could be present at the end of this.,Another portal was created laterally to do all of this.  We did what we could to mobilize all sections of the rotator cuff, superiorly, posteriorly, and anteriorly.  We took this back to the level of coracoid base.  We released the coracohumeral ligament basically all but there was no excursion basically all to the portion of the rotator cuff torn.  Because of this, further debridement was carried out.  Debridement had been previously carried out to the humeral head as well as glenoid surface to debride the chondromalacia and take this down to the smooth edge.  Care was taken to not to debride deeper than that.  This was done prior to the above.,All instrumentation was removed.  A Pain-Buster catheter was placed into a separate anterolateral portal cut to length.  Interrupted #4-0 nylon was utilized for portal closures.  Adaptic, 4x4s, ABDs, Elastoplast tape were placed for a compression dressing.,The patient's arm was placed in an arm sling.

The arm was exsanguinated and the tourniquet was elevated to 290 mm/Hg.  A transverse incision was made over the dorsal ganglion.  Using blunt dissection the dorsal ulnar sensory nerve branches and radial sensory nerve branches were dissected and retracted out of the operative field.  The extensor retinaculum was then incised and the extensor tendon was dissected and retracted out of the operative field.  The ganglion was then further dissected to its origin from the dorsal distal scapholunate interosseus ligament and excised in toto.  Care was taken to protect ligament integrity.  Reactive synovium was then removed using soft tissue rongeur technique.  The wound was then infiltrated with 0.25% Marcaine.  The tendons were allowed to resume their normal anatomical position.

Due to the peripheral nature of the tumor located in the mid to lower pole laterally, he has elected to undergo a partial nephrectomy.  Potential complications include but are not limited to,,1.  Infection.,2.  Bleeding.,3.  Postoperative pain.,4.  Herniation from the incision.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:,  Epidural anesthesia was administered in the holding area, after which the patient was transferred into the operating room.  General endotracheal anesthesia was administered, after which the patient was positioned in the flank standard position.  A left flank incision was made over the area of the twelfth rib.  The subcutaneous space was opened by using the Bovie.  The ribs were palpated clearly and the fascia overlying the intercostal space between the eleventh and twelfth rib was opened by using the Bovie.  The fascial layer covering of the intercostal space was opened completely until the retroperitoneum was entered.  Once the retroperitoneum had been entered, the incision was extended until the peritoneal envelope could be identified.  The peritoneum was swept medially.  The Finochietto retractor was then placed for exposure.  The kidney was readily identified and was mobilized from outside Gerota's fascia.  The ureter was dissected out easily and was separated with a vessel loop.  The superior aspect of the kidney was mobilized from the superior attachment.  The pedicle of the left kidney was completely dissected revealing the vein and the artery.  The artery was a single artery and was dissected easily by using a right-angle clamp.  A vessel loop was placed around the renal artery.  The tumor could be easily palpated in the lateral lower pole to mid pole of the left kidney.  The Gerota's fascia overlying that portion of the kidney was opened in the area circumferential to the tumor.  Once the renal capsule had been identified, the capsule was scored using a Bovie about 0.5 cm lateral to the border of the tumor.  Bulldog clamp was then placed on the renal artery.  The tumor was then bluntly dissected off of the kidney with a thin rim of a normal renal cortex.  This was performed by using the blunted end of the scalpel.  The tumor was removed easily.  The argon beam coagulation device was then utilized to coagulate the base of the resection.  The visible larger bleeding vessels were oversewn by using 4-0 Vicryl suture.  The edges of the kidney were then reapproximated by using 2-0 Vicryl suture with pledgets at the ends of the sutures to prevent the sutures from pulling through.  Two horizontal mattress sutures were placed and were tied down.  The Gerota's fascia was then also closed by using 2-0 Vicryl suture.  The area of the kidney at the base was covered with Surgicel prior to tying the sutures.  The bulldog clamp was removed and perfect hemostasis was evident.  There was no evidence of violation into the calyceal system.  A 19-French Blake drain was placed in the inferior aspect of the kidney exiting the left flank inferior to the incision.  The drain was anchored by using silk sutures.  The flank fascial layers were closed in three separate layers in the more medial aspect.  The lateral posterior aspect was closed in two separate layers using Vicryl sutures.  The skin was finally reapproximated by using metallic clips.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.\",\n",

Care was taken to protect pressure points. The back was shaved, scrubbed with Betadine scrub, rinsed with alcohol, and prepped with DuraPrep, and draped in the usual sterile fashion with Ioban drape being used. A midline skin incision was made, excising scar from previous surgery. Dissection was carried down through the subcutaneous tissue with electrocautery technique. The lumbosacral fascia was split to the left of the spinous process, and subperiosteal dissection of the spinous process and lamina, area of previous laminotomy was identified. Cross-table lateral was also made to confirm position. The scar was then loosened from the inferior portion of 4, superior of L5 lamina, and a portion of the lamina was removed. I did identify normal dura. The scar was then lysed from the medial wall. Dura and nerve root were identified and protected with nerve root retractor. The bulging disk fragment was still contained under the longitudinal ligament. A rent was made with the Penfield and a moderately large fragment was removed. The disk space was then entered with a cruciate cut in the annulus, with additional nuclear material being received. When no other fragments could be removed from the disk space, no other fragments were felt in the central canal under the longitudinal ligament, and a Murphy ball could be passed through the foramen without evidence of compression, the decompression was complete. Check was made for CSF leakage, and no evidence of significant epidural bleeding was present. The wound was irrigated with antibiotic solution. Twenty milligrams of Depo-Medrol was placed over the dura and nerve root. A free fat graft from the subcutaneous tissue was then placed over the dura. Closure was obtained with the lumbosacral fascia being reapproximated with #1, running, Vicryl suture. Subcutaneous closure was obtained in layers with 2-0, running, Vicryl suture. Skin closure was obtained with 3-0 Vicryl subcuticular suture. Proxi-Strips and sterile dressing was applied. The skin had been infiltrated with 8 mL of 0.5% Marcaine with epinephrine.,After a sterile dressing was applied, the patient was turned into the supine position on the waiting recovery room stretcher, brought from under the effects of anesthesia, and taken to the recovery room.',\n",

Ligation and stripping of left greater saphenous vein to the level of the knee.,2.  Stripping of multiple left lower extremity varicose veins.,ANESTHESIA:,  General endotracheal.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: , Approximately 150 mL.,SPECIMENS: , Multiple veins.,COMPLICATIONS:,  None.,BRIEF HISTORY:,  This is a 30-year-old Caucasian male who presented for elective evaluation from Dr. X's office for evaluation of intractable pain from the left lower extremity.  The patient has had painful varicose veins for number of years.  He has failed conservative measures and has felt more aggressive treatment to alleviate his pain secondary to his varicose veins.  It was recommended that the patient undergo a saphenous vein ligation and stripping.  He was explained the risks, benefits, and complications of the procedure including intractable pain.  He gave informed consent to proceed.,OPERATIVE FINDINGS:,  The left greater saphenous vein femoral junction was identified and multiple tributaries were ligated surrounding this region.,The vein was stripped from the saphenofemoral junction to the level of the knee.  Multiple tributaries of the greater saphenous vein and varicose veins from the left lower extremity were ligated and stripped accordingly.  Additionally, there were noted to be multiple regions within these veins that were friable and edematous consistent with acute and chronic inflammatory changes making stripping of these varicose veins extremely difficult.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was marked preoperatively in the Preanesthesia Care Unit.  The patient was brought to the operating suite, placed in the supine position.  The patient underwent general endotracheal intubation.  After adequate anesthesia was obtained, the left lower extremity was prepped and draped circumferentially from the foot all the way to the distal section of the left lower quadrant and just right of midline.  A diagonal incision was created in the direction of the inguinal crease on the left.  A self-retaining retractor was placed and the incision was carried down through the subcutaneous tissues until the greater saphenous vein was identified.  The vein was isolated with a right angle.  The vein was followed proximally until a multiple tributary branches were identified.  These were ligated with #3-0 silk suture.  The dissection was then carried to the femorosaphenous vein junction.  This was identified and #0 silk suture was placed proximally and distally and ligated in between.  The proximal suture was tied down.  Distal suture was retracted and a vein stripping device was placed within the greater saphenous vein.  An incision was created at the level of the knee.  The distal segment of the greater saphenous vein was identified and the left foot was encircled with #0 silk suture and tied proximally and then ligated.  The distal end of the vein stripping device was then passed through at its most proximal location.  The device was attached to the vein stripping section and the greater saphenous vein was then stripped free from its canal within the left lower extremity.  Next, attention was made towards the multiple tributaries of the varicose vein within the left lower leg.  Multiple incisions were created with a #15 blade scalpel.  The incisions were carried down with electrocautery.  Next, utilizing sharp dissection with a hemostat, the tissue was spread until the vein was identified.  The vein was then followed to T3 and in all these locations intersecting segments of varicose veins were identified and removed.  Additionally, some segments were removed.  The stripping approach would be vein stripping device.  Multiple branches of the saphenous vein were then ligated and/or removed.  Occasionally, dissection was unable to be performed as the vein was too friable and would tear from the hemostat.  Bleeding was controlled with direct pressure.  All incisions were then closed with interrupted #3-0 Vicryl sutures and/or #4-0 Vicryl sutures.,The femoral incision was closed with interrupted multiple #3-0 Vicryl sutures and closed with a running #4-0 subcuticular suture.  The leg was then cleaned, dried, and then Steri-Strips were placed over the incisions.  The leg was then wrapped with a sterile Kerlix.  Once the Kerlix was achieved, an Ace wrap was placed over the left lower extremity for compression.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to Postanesthesia Care Unit extubated in stable condition.  He will undergo evaluation postoperatively and will be seen shortly in the postanesthesia care unit.\",\n",

The patient had previously been on Coumadin and then heparin.  Heparin was discontinued approximately one-and-a-half hours prior to the procedure.  The patient underwent topical anesthesia with 10 cc of 4% Xylocaine spray to the left nares and nasopharynx.  Blood pressure, EKG, and oximetry monitoring were applied and monitored continuously throughout the procedure.  Oxygen at two liters via nasal cannula was delivered with saturations in the 90% to 100% throughout the procedure.  The patient was premedicated with 50 mg of Demerol and 2 mg of Versed.  After conscious sedation was achieved, the bronchoscope was advanced through the left nares into the nasopharynx and oropharynx.  There was minimal redundant oral soft tissue in the oropharynx.  There was mild erythema.  Clear secretions were suctioned.,Additional topical anesthesia was applied to the larynx and then throughout the tracheobronchial tree for the procedure, a total of 16 cc of 2% Xylocaine was applied.  Vocal cord motion was normal.  The bronchoscope was then advanced through the larynx into the trachea.  There was evidence of moderate inflammation with prominent vascular markings and edema.  No frank blood was visualized.  The area was suction clear of copious amounts of clear white secretions.  Additional topical anesthesia was applied and the bronchoscope was advanced into the left main stem.  The bronchoscope was then sequentially advanced into each segment and sub-segment of the left upper lobe and left lower lobe.  There was significant amount of inflammation, induration, and vascular tortuosity in these regions.  No frank blood was identified.  No masses or lesions were identified.  There was senile bronchiectasis with slight narrowing and collapse during the exhalation.  The air was suctioned clear.  The bronchoscope was withdrawn and advanced into the right main stem.  Bronchoscope was introduced into the right upper lobe and each sub-segment was visualized.  Again significant amounts of tracheobronchitis was noted with vascular infiltration.  In the sub-carina of the anterior segment of the right upper lobe, there was evidence of a submucosal hematoma without frank mass underneath this.  The bronchoscope was removed and advanced into the right middle and right lower lobe.  There was marked injection and inflammation in these regions.  In addition, there was marked vascular engorgement with near frank varicosities identified throughout the region.  Again, white clear secretions were identified.  No masses or other processes were noted.  The area was suctioned clear.  A bronchoalveolar lavage was subsequently performed in the anterior segment of the right lower lobe.  The bronchoscope was then withdrawn and readvanced into the right upper lobe.  Endobronchial biopsies of the carina of the sub-segment and anterior segment of the right upper lobe were obtained.  Minimal hemorrhage occurred after the biopsy, which stopped after 1 cc of 1:1000 epinephrine.  The area remained clear.  No further hemorrhage was identified.  The bronchoscope was subsequently withdrawn.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and was stable throughout the procedure.  No further hemoptysis was identified.

This morning, the patient developed worsening hypoxia with abundant sputum production requiring frequent suctioning from his ET tube.  The patient also had new-appearing atelectasis versus infiltrates in the right lower lobe of his lung on chest x-ray.  Given these findings, it was felt that bronchoscopy could further define source of secretions and send more appropriate specimen for culture if need be.,OPERATION:,  The patient was given additional fentanyl, Versed as well as paralytics for the procedure.  Small bronchoscope was inserted through the ET tube and to the trachea to the level of carina.  There was noted to be thick clear secretions adherent to the trachea walls as well as into the right mainstem bronchus.  Extensive secretions extended down into the secondary airways.  This was lavaged with saline and suctioned dry.  There is no overt specific occlusion of airways, nor was there any purulent-appearing sputum.  The bronchoscope was then advanced into the left mainstem bronchus, and there was noted to be a small amount of similar-appearing secretions which was likewise suctioned and cleaned.  The bronchoscope was removed, and the patient was increased to PEEP of 10 on the ventilator.  Please note that prior to starting bronchoscopy, he was pre oxygenated with 100% O2.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and lavage specimen was sent for gram stain as well as routine culture.',\n",

The pain was described as a constant pain in the middle to lower back and hips. The pain was exacerbated by climbing stairs and in the morning after sleeping. He reported occasional radiation of pain from back into buttocks (greatest on the right side). He has history of chronic feet and leg numbness and paraesthesias related to his neuropathy, but he denied any recent changes in these symptoms in relation to the back pain. He denied any history of trauma. He was treated symptomatically with Acetaminophen with only some relief. He continued to complain intermittently of pain in his back and hips, and occasionally even in his elbows during the next 8 months. In January 2002, plain pelvic films showed no fracture or dislocation of the hips. Elbow films also showed no acute injury, but there were some erosions along the posterior aspect of the olecranon. An MRI was performed of his lumbar spine which showed degenerative disk disease, spondylosis, and annular bulging/herniation at L4-L5 with resultant encroachment on the neural foramen. He was evaluated by neurosurgery, who felt he should not have surgery at this time. His pain continued and progressively worsened, becoming unresponsive to medical therapy including narcotics,In May 2002, as part of a vascular work-up for the patient’s non-healing right toe, an MRA showed extensive vascular disease in the vessels of both legs below the knees and evidence of bilateral trochanteric bursitis.

Lumbar laminectomy for decompression with foraminotomies L3-L4, L4-L5, L5-S1 microtechniques.,2.  Repair of CSF fistula, microtechniques L5-S1, application of DuraSeal.,INDICATIONS:,  The patient is an 82-year-old woman who has about a four-month history now of urinary incontinence and numbness in her legs and hands, and difficulty ambulating.  She was evaluated with an MRI scan, which showed a very high-grade stenosis in her lumbar spine, and subsequent evaluation included a myelogram, which demonstrated cervical stenosis at C4-C5, C5-C6, and C6-C7 as well as a complete block of the contrast at L4-L5 and no contrast at L5-S1 either and stenosis at L3-L4 and all the way up, but worse at L3-L4, L4-L5, and L5-S1.  Yesterday, she underwent an anterior cervical discectomy and fusions C4-C5, C5-C6, C6-C7 and had some improvement of her symptoms and increased strength, even in the recovery room.  She was kept in the ICU because of her age and the need to bring her back to the operating room today for decompressive lumbar laminectomy.  The rationale for putting the surgery is close together that she is normally on Coumadin for atrial fibrillation, though she has been cardioverted.  She and her son understand the nature, indications, and risks of the surgery, and agreed to go ahead.,PROCEDURE: , The patient was brought from the Neuro ICU to the operating room, where general endotracheal anesthesia was obtained.  She was rolled in a prone position on the Wilson frame.  The back was prepared in the usual manner with Betadine soak, followed by Betadine paint.  Markings were applied.  Sterile drapes were applied.  Using the usual anatomical landmarks, linear midline incision was made presumed over L4-L5 and L5-S1.  Sharp dissection was carried down into subcutaneous tissue, then Bovie electrocautery was used to isolate the spinous processes.  A Kocher clamp was placed in the anterior spinous ligament and this turned out to be L5-S1.  The incision was extended rostrally and deep Gelpi's were inserted to expose the spinous processes and lamina of L3, L4, L5, and S1.  Using the Leksell rongeur, the spinous processes of L4 and L5 were removed completely, and the caudal part of L3.  A high-speed drill was then used to thin the caudal lamina of L3, all of the lamina of L4 and of L5.  Then using various Kerrison punches, I proceeded to perform a laminectomy.  Removing the L5 lamina, there was a dural band attached to the ligamentum flavum and this caused about a 3-mm tear in the dura.  There was CSF leak.  The lamina removal was continued, ligamentum flavum was removed to expose all the dura.  Then using 4-0 Nurolon suture, a running-locking suture was used to close the approximate 3-mm long dural fistula.  There was no CSF leak with Valsalva.,I then continued the laminectomy removing all of the lamina of L5 and of L4, removing the ligamentum flavum between L3-L4, L4-L5 and L5-S1.  Foraminotomies were accomplished bilaterally.  The caudal aspect of the lamina of L3 also was removed.  The dura came up quite nicely.  I explored out along the L4, L5, and S1 nerve roots after completing the foraminotomies, the roots were quite free.  Further more, the thecal sac came up quite nicely.  In order to ensure no CSF leak, we would follow the patient out of the operating room.  The dural closure was covered with a small piece of fat.  This was all then covered with DuraSeal glue.  Gelfoam was placed on top of this, then the muscle was closed with interrupted 0 Ethibond.  The lumbodorsal fascia was closed with multiple sutures of interrupted 0 Ethibond in a watertight fashion.  Scarpa's fascia was closed with a running 0 Vicryl, and finally the skin was closed with a running-locking 3-0 nylon.  The wound was blocked with 0.5% plain Marcaine.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:  Estimated blood loss for the case was about 100 mL.,SPONGE AND NEEDLE COUNTS:  Correct.,FINDINGS:  A very tight high-grade stenosis at L3-L4, L4-L5, and L5-S1.  There were adhesions between the dura and the ligamentum flavum owing to the severity and length of the stenosis.,The patient tolerated the procedure well with stable vitals throughout.\",\n",

Since that time, she is felt to have facial asymmetry, which is apparent in publicity photographs for her record promotions.  She had requested a procedure to bring about further facial asymmetry.  She was seen preoperatively by psychiatrist specializing in body dysmorphic disorder as well as analysis of the patient's requesting cosmetic surgery and was felt to be a psychiatrically good candidate.  She did have facial asymmetry with the bit of more fullness in higher cheekbone on the right as compared to the left.  Preoperative workup including CT scan failed to show any skeletal trauma.  The patient was counseled with regard to the risks, benefits, alternatives, and complications of the postsurgical procedure including but not limited to bleeding, infection, unacceptable cosmetic appearance, numbness of the face, change in sensation of the face, facial nerve paralysis, need for further surgery, need for revision, hair loss, etc., and informed consent was obtained.,PROCEDURE:,  The patient was taken to the operating room, placed in supine position after having been marked in the upright position while awake.  General endotracheal anesthesia was induced with a #6 endotracheal tube.  All appropriate measures were taken to preserve the vocal cords in a professional singer.  Local anesthesia consisting of 5/6th 1% lidocaine with 1:100,000 units of epinephrine in 1/6th 0.25% Marcaine was mixed and then injected in a regional field block fashion in the subperiosteal plane via the gingivobuccal sulcus injection on either side as well as into the temporal fossa at the level of the true temporal fascia.  The upper eyelids were injected with 1 cc of 1% Xylocaine with 1:100,000 units of epinephrine.  Adequate time for vasoconstriction and anesthesia was allowed to be obtained.  The patient was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  A 4-0 silk suture was placed in the right lower lid.  For traction, it was brought anteriorly.  The conjunctiva was incised with the needle tip Bovie with Jaeger lid plate protecting the cornea and globe.  A Q-Tip was then used to separate the orbicularis oculi muscle from the fat pad beneath and carried down to the bone.  The middle and medial fat pads were identified and a small amount of fat was removed from each to take care of the pseudofat herniation, which was present.  The inferior oblique muscle was identified, preserved, and protected throughout the procedure.  The transconjunctival incision was then closed with buried knots of 6-0 fast absorbing gut.  Contralateral side was treated in similar fashion with like results and throughout the procedure.  Lacri-Lube was in the eyes in order to maintain hydration.  Attention was next turned to the midface, where a temporal incision was made parallel to the nasojugal folds.  Dissection was carried out with the hemostat down to the true temporal fascia and the endoscopic temporal dissection dissector was used to elevate the true temporal fascia.  A 30-degree endoscope was used to visualize the fat pads, so that we knew we are in the proper plane.  Subperiosteal dissection was carried out over the zygomatic arch and Whitnall's tubercle and the temporal dissection was completed.,Next, bilateral gingivobuccal sulcus incisions were made and a Joseph elevator was used to elevate the periosteum of the midface and anterior face of the maxilla from the tendon of the masseter muscle up to Whitnall's tubercle.  The two dissection planes within joint in the subperiosteal fashion and dissection proceeded laterally out to the zygomatic neurovascular bundle.  It was bipolar electrocauteried and the tunnel was further dissected free and opened.  The endotine 4.5 soft tissue suspension device was then inserted through the temporal incision, brought down into the subperiosteal midface plane of dissection.  The guard was removed and the suspension spikes were engaged into the soft tissues.  The spikes were elevated superiorly such that a symmetrical midface elevation was carried out bilaterally.  The endotine device was then secured to the true temporal fascia with three sutures of 3-0 PDS suture.  Contralateral side was treated in similar fashion with like results in order to achieve facial symmetry and symmetry was obtained.  The gingivobuccal sulcus incisions were closed with interrupted 4-0 chromic and the scalp incision was closed with staples.  The sterile dressing was applied.

Left ventriculogram.,6.  Aortogram.,7.  Percutaneous intervention of the left circumflex and obtuse marginal branch with plano balloon angioplasty unable to pass stent.,NARRATIVE:,  After all risks and benefits were explained to the patient, informed consent was obtained.  The patient was brought to the cardiac catheterization suite.  The right groin was prepped in the usual sterile fashion.  Right common femoral artery was cannulated using a modified Seldinger technique and a long 6-French AO sheath was introduced secondary to tortuous aorta.  Next, Judkins left catheter was used to engage the left coronary system.  Cineangiography was recorded in multiple views.  Next, Judkins right catheter was used to engage the right coronary system.  Cineangiography was recorded in multiple views.  Next, the Judkins right catheter was used to engage the SVG to OM.  Cineangiography was recorded.  Next, the Judkins right was advanced into the left subclavian and exchanged over a long exchange length J-wire for a 4-French left internal mammary artery which was used to engage the LIMA graft to LAD and cineangiography was recorded in multiple views.  Next, an angled pigtail catheter was advanced into the left ventricular cavity.  LV pressures were measured.  LV gram was done and a pullback gradient across the aortic valve was done and recorded.  Next, an aortogram was done and recorded.  At this point, I decided to proceed with percutaneous intervention of the left circumflex.  Therefore, AVA 3.5 guide was used to engage the left coronary artery.  Angiomax bolus and drip was started.  Universal wire was advanced past the lesion and a 2.5-balloon was advanced first to the proximal lesions and predilations were done at 14 atmospheres and then to the distal lesion and predilatation was done at 12 atmospheres.  Next, we attempted to advance a 3.0 x 12 stent to the distal lesion; however, we were unable to pass the stent.  Next, second dilatations were done again with the 2.5 balloon at 18 atmospheres; however, we are unable to break the lesion.  We next attempted a cutting balloon.  Again, we are unable to cross the lesion, therefore a buddy wire technique was used with a PT choice support wire.  Again, we were unable to cross the lesion with the stent.  We then try to cross with a noncompliant balloon, which we were unsuccessful.  We also try to cutting balloon again, we were unsuccessful.  Despite multiple dilatations, we were unable to cross anything beyond the noncompliant balloon across the lesion; therefore, finally the procedure was aborted.  Final images showed no evidence of dissection, perforation, or further complication.  The right groin was filled after taking an image to confirm sheath placement above the bifurcation with excellent results.  The patient tolerated the procedure very well without complications, was taken off the operating table and transferred back to cardiac telemetry floor.,DIAGNOSTIC FINDINGS,1.  The LV.  LVEDP was 4.  LVES is approximately 50%-55% with inferobasal hypokinesis.  No significant MR. No gradient across the aortic valve.,2.  Aortogram.  The ascending aorta shows no significant dilatation or evidence of dissection.  The valve shows no significant aortic insufficiencies.  The abdominal aorta and distal aorta shows significant tortuosities.,3.  The left main.  The left main coronary artery is a large caliber vessel, bifurcating the LAD and left circumflex with some mild distal disease of about 10%-20%.,4.  Left circumflex.  The left circumflex vessel is a large caliber vessel gives off a distal branching obtuse marginal branch.  The upper pole of the OM shows retrograde filling of the distal graft and also at that point approximately a 70%-80% stenosis.  The mid left circumflex is a high-grade 80% diffuse tortuous stenosis.,5.  LAD.  The LAD is a totally 100% occluded vessel.  The LIMA to LAD is patent with only a small-to-moderate caliber LAD.  There is a large diagonal branch coming off the proximal portion of the LAD and that proximal LAD showed some diffuse disease upwards of 60%-70%.  The diagonal shows proximal 80% stenosis.,6.  The right coronary artery:  The right coronary artery is 100% occluded.  There are retrograde collaterals from left to right to the distal PDA and PLV branches.  The SVG to OM is 100% occluded at its take off.  The SVG to PDA is not found; however, presumed 100% occluded given that there is collateral flow to the distal right.,7.  LIMA to LAD is widely patent.,ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: , Attempted intervention to the left circumflex system, only able to perform plano balloon angioplasty, unable to pass stents, noncompliant balloons or cutting balloon.  Final images showed some improvement, however, continued residual stenosis.  At this point, the patient will be transferred back to telemetry floor and monitored.  We can attempt future intervention or continue aggressive medical management.  The patient continues to have residual stenosis in the diagonal; however, due to the length of this procedure, I did not attempt intervention to that diagonal branch.  Possible consideration would be a stress test as an outpatient depending on where patient shows ischemia, focus on treatment to that lesion.',\n",

The patient subsequently went to the operating room on 07/25/2003 for a right hip hemiarthroplasty per the Orthopedics Department.  Subsequently, the patient was doing well postoperatively, however, the patient does have severe O2 and steroid-dependent COPD and at an extreme risk for any procedure.  The patient began developing abdominal pain over the course of the next several days and a consultation was requested on 08/07/2003 for surgical evaluation for upper abdominal pain.  During the evaluation, the patient was found to have an acute acalculous cholecystitis in which nonoperative management was opted for and on 08/08/03, the patient underwent a percutaneous cholecystostomy tube placement to drain the gallbladder.  The patient did well postdrainage.  The patient's laboratory values and biliary values returned to normal and the patient was planned for a removal of the tube with 48 hours of the tubing clamp.  However, once the tube was removed, the patient re-obstructed with recurrent symptoms and a second tube was needed to be placed; this was done on 08/16/2003.  A HIDA scan had been performed, which showed no cystic duct obstruction.  A tube cholecystogram was performed, which showed no cystic or common duct obstruction.  There was abnormal appearance of the gallbladder, however, the pathway was patent.  Thus after failure of two nonoperative management therapies, extensive discussions were made with the family and the patient's only option was to undergo a cholecystectomy.  Initial thoughts were to do a laparoscopic cholecystectomy, however, with the patient's severe COPD and risk for ventilator management, the options were an epidural and an open cholecystectomy under local was made and to be performed.,INTRAOPERATIVE FINDINGS:  ,The patient's gallbladder had some patchy and necrosis areas.  There were particular changes on the serosal surface as well as on the mucosal surface with multiple clots within the gallbladder.  The patient also had no plane between the gallbladder and the liver bed.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE: , After informed written consent, risks and benefits of the procedure were explained to the patient and discussed with the patient's family.  The patient was brought to the operating room after an epidural was performed per anesthesia.  Local anesthesia was given with 1% lidocaine.  A paramedian incision was made approximately 5 cm in length with a #15 blade scalpel.  Next, hemostasis was obtained using electro Bovie cautery.  Dissection was carried down transrectus in the midline to the posterior rectus fascia, which was grasped with hemostats and entered with a #10 blade scalpel.  Next, Metzenbaum scissors were used to extend the incision and the abdomen was entered .  The gallbladder was immediately visualized and brought up into view, grasped with two ring clamps elevating the biliary tree into view.  Dissection with a ______ was made to identify the cystic artery and cystic duct, which were both easily identified.  The cystic artery was clipped, two distal and one proximal to the gallbladder cutting between with Metzenbaum scissors.  The cystic duct was identified.  A silk tie #3-0 silk was placed one distal and one proximal with #3-0 silk and then cutting in between with a Metzenbaum scissors.  The gallbladder was then removed from the liver bed using electro Bovie cautery.  A plane was created.  The hemostasis was obtained using the electro Bovie cautery as well as some Surgicel.  The gallbladder was then removed as specimen, sent to pathology for frozen sections for diagnosis, of which the hemorrhagic cholecystitis was diagnosed on frozen sections.  Permanent sections are still pending.  The remainder of the fossa was hemostatic with the Surgicel and attention was next made to closing the abdomen.  The peritoneum as well as posterior rectus fascia was approximated with a running #0 Vicryl suture and then the anterior rectus fascia was closed in interrupted figure-of-eight #0 Vicryl sutures.  Skin staples were used on the skin and sterile dressings were applied and the patient was transferred to recovery in stable condition.\",\n",

She has done quite well with this.  She now has had worsening left knee pain predominantly on the inside of her knee and has consented for unicompartmental knee replacement on the left.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , The patient was brought to the operating room and placed supine on the operating room table.  After appropriate anesthesia, the left lower extremity was identified with a time out procedure.  Preoperative antibiotics were given.  Left lower extremity was then prepped and draped in usual sterile fashion after applying a thigh tourniquet.  The tourniquet was insufflated after elevation of the limb, and a standard medial parapatellar incision was used.  Soft tissue dissection was carried down the retinaculum, was opened sharply to expose the joint, meniscus that was visible along the tibia was removed.  The anterior fat pad was removed.  The knee was then examined.  The ACL was found to be intact.  The lateral compartment had very minimal arthritis.  There were some osteoarthritic changes of the patellofemoral joint, but these were felt to be mild.  Following this, the tibial external alignment guide was placed and pinned into place in the appropriate place.  Tibial bone cut was made and checked with a feeler gauge and felt to be an adequate resection.  Following this resection, the femoral intramedullary guide was placed without difficulty.  The femoral cutting guide was then placed and referenced off of this femoral intramedullary guide.  Once in the appropriate position, it was pinned and drilled.  This was removed, and the posterior cutting block was inserted.  It was impacted into place.  Posterior bone cut was made for the medium femoral component.  Next, a zero spigot was used and the distal femur was reamed.  Following this, the check of the extension and flexion gaps revealed that an additional 1 mm needed to be reamed, so 1 spigot was used and this was reamed as well.  Next, trial components were placed into the knee and the knee was taken through range of motion and felt to come out to full extension with a 3 mm poly with a good fit.  Next, the tibia was prepared.  The tibial tray was pinned into place, and the cuts for the keel of the tibia were made.  These were removed with a small osteotome from the set.  Following this, a trial tibial with the keel was placed and it did fit nicely.  After this, all trial components were removed.  The knee was copiously irrigated.  Cement was begun mixing.  Drill holes were used along the femur for cement interdigitation.  The wound was cleaned and dried.  Cement was placed on the tibia.  Tibial tray was impacted into place.  Excess cement was removed.  Tibia was placed in the femur.  Femoral component was impacted into place.  Excess cement was removed.  It was held with a 4 mm trial insert and approximately 30 degrees of knee flexion until the cement had hardened.  Following this, it was again trialed with a meniscal bearing implant and it was felt that 3 mm would be the appropriate size.  A 3 mm polyethylene was chosen and inserted in the knee without difficulty, taken through range of motion and found to come out to full extension with no impingement and full flexion.  The intramedullary rod removed from the femur.  The wound was irrigated with normal saline.  The retinaculum was closed with #1 PDS, 2-0 Monocryl was used for the subcutaneous tissue and staples used for the skin.  A sterile dressing was placed.  Tourniquet was then desufflated.  Sponge and needle counts were correct at the end of the procedure.  Dr. Jinnah was present for the surgery.  The patient was transferred to the recovery room in stable condition.  She will be weightbearing as tolerated in the left lower extremity and will be maintained on Lovenox for DVT prophylaxis.  Prior to closure, the posterior capsule was injected with the joint cocktail.',\n",
       " \"PROBLEM:,  Probable Coumadin hypersensitivity.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:,  The patient is an 82-year-old Caucasian female admitted to the Hospital for elective total left knee arthroplasty.  At the time of admission, the patient has a normal prothrombin time and INR of 13.4 seconds and 1.09 respectively and postoperatively, she was placed on Coumadin which is the usual orthopedic surgery procedure for reducing the risk of postoperative thromboembolic activity.  However, the patient's prothrombin time and INR rapidly rose to supratherapeutic levels.  Even though Coumadin was discontinued on 01/21/09, the patient's prothrombin time and INR has continued to rise.  Her prothrombin time is now 83.3 seconds with an INR of 6.52.  Hematology/Oncology consult was requested for recommendation regarding further evaluation and management.,SOCIAL HISTORY: , The patient is originally from Maine.  She has lived in Arizona for 4 years.  She has had 2 children; however, only one is living.  She had one child died from complications of ulcerative colitis.  She has been predominantly a homemaker during her life, but has done some domestic cleaning work in the past.,CHILDHOOD HISTORY: , Negative for rheumatic fever.  The patient has usual childhood illnesses.,ALLERGIES:  ,No known drug allergies.,FAMILY HISTORY: , The patient's mother died from gastric cancer.  She had a brother who died from mesothelioma.  He did have a positive asbestos exposure working in the shipyards.  The patient's father died from motor vehicle accident.  She had a sister who succumbed to pneumonia as a complication to Alzheimer disease.,HABITS: , No use of ethanol, tobacco, illicit, or recreational substances.,ADULT MEDICAL PROBLEMS: , The patient has a history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and hypercholesterolemia, which is all consistent with the metabolic syndrome X.  In addition, the patient's husband, who is present, knows that she has early dementia and has problems with memory and difficulty in processing new information.,SURGERIES: , The patient's only surgery is the aforementioned left knee arthroplasty and bilateral cataract surgery, otherwise negative.,MEDICATIONS: , The patient's medications on admission include:,1.

She has a dressing over the left knee.,SKIN:  Without lesions.,NEURO:  Unable to assess in light of post morphine obtunded state.,ASSESSMENT: , Hypersensitivity to Coumadin.,PLAN: , Gave the patient vitamin K at this time.  Literature suggested oral vitamin K is actually more efficacious than parenteral.  However, in light of the fact that the patient is obtunded and is not taking anything right now in the way of oral food or fluids, we will give this to her in an IM fashion.  Repeat prothrombin time and INR in a.m.  Once she has come down to a more therapeutic range, I would initiate low-molecular weight heparin in the form of Fragmin one time a day or Lovenox on a b.i.d. schedule for 4 to 6 weeks postoperatively.\",\n",

Chronic right ear otalgia.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Pending pathology.,PROCEDURE PERFORMED: , Microsuspension direct laryngoscopy with biopsy.,ANESTHESIA: , General.,INDICATION:,  This is a 50-year-old female who presents to the office with a chief complaint of ear pain on the right side.  Exact etiology of her ear pain had not been identified.  A fiberoptic examination had been performed in the office.  Upon examination, she was noted to have fullness in the right base of her tongue.  She was counseled on the risks, benefits, and alternatives to surgery and consented to such.,PROCEDURE: , After informed consent was obtained, the patient was brought to the Operative Suite where she was placed in supine position.  General endotracheal tube intubation was delivered by the Department of Anesthesia.  The patient was rotated 90 degrees away where a shoulder roll was placed.  A tooth guard was then placed to protect the upper dentition.  The Dedo laryngoscope was then inserted into the oral cavity.  It was advanced on the right lateral pharyngeal wall until the epiglottis was brought into view.  At this point, it was advanced underneath the epiglottis until the vocal cords were seen.  At this point, it was suspended via the Lewy suspension arm from the Mayo stand.  At this point, the Zeiss microscope with a 400 mm lens was brought into the surgical field.  Inspection of the vocal cords underneath the microscope revealed them to be white and glistening without any mucosal abnormalities.  It should be mentioned that the right vocal cord did appear to be slightly more hyperemic, however, there were no mucosal abnormalities identified.  This was confirmed with a laryngeal probe as well as use of mirror evaluated in the subglottic portion as well as the ventricle.  At this point, the scope was desuspended and the microscope was removed.  The scope was withdrawn through the vallecular region.  Inspection of the vallecula revealed a fullness on the right side with a papillomatous type growth that appeared very friable.  Biopsies were obtained with straight-biting cup forceps.  Once hemostasis was achieved, the scope was advanced into the piriform sinuses.  Again in the right piriform sinus, there was noted to be studding along the right lateral wall of the piriform sinus.  Again, biopsies were performed and once hemostasis was achieved, the scope was further withdrawn down the lateral pharyngeal wall.  There were no mucosal abnormalities identified within the oropharynx.  The scope was then completely removed and a bimanual examination was performed.  No neck masses were identified.  At this point, the procedure was complete.  The mouth guard was removed and the patient was returned to Anesthesia for awakening and taken to the recovery room without incident.',\n",
       " 'HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:,  The patient is well known to me for a history of iron-deficiency anemia due to chronic blood loss from colitis.  We corrected her hematocrit last year with intravenous (IV) iron.  Ultimately, she had a total proctocolectomy done on 03/14/2007 to treat her colitis.  Her course has been very complicated since then with needing multiple surgeries for removal of hematoma.  This is partly because she was on anticoagulation for a right arm deep venous thrombosis (DVT) she had early this year, complicated by septic phlebitis.,Chart was reviewed, and I will not reiterate her complex history.,I am asked to see the patient again because of concerns for coagulopathy.,She had surgery again last month to evacuate a pelvic hematoma, and was found to have vancomycin resistant enterococcus, for which she is on multiple antibiotics and followed by infectious disease now.,She is on total parenteral nutrition (TPN) as well.,LABORATORY DATA:,  Labs today showed a white blood count of 7.9, hemoglobin 11.0, hematocrit 32.8, and platelets 1,121,000.  MCV is 89.  Her platelets have been elevated for at least the past week, with counts initially at the 600,000 to 700,000 range and in the last couple of day rising above 1,000,000.  Her hematocrit has been essentially stable for the past month or so.  White blood count has improved.,PT has been markedly elevated and today is 44.9 with an INR of 5.0.  This is despite stopping Coumadin on 05/31/2007, and with administration of vitamin K via the TPN, as well as additional doses IV.  The PT is slightly improved over the last few days, being high at 65.0 with an INR of 7.3 yesterday.,PTT has not been checked since 05/18/2007 and was normal then at 28.,LFTs have been elevated.  ALT is 100, AST 57, GGT 226, alkaline phosphatase 505, albumin low at 3.3, uric acid high at 4.9, bilirubin normal, LDH normal, and pre-albumin low at 16.  Creatinine is at 1.5, with an estimated creatinine clearance low at 41.7.  Other electrolytes are fairly normal.,B12 was assessed on 05/19/2007 and was normal at 941.  Folic acid was normal.  Iron saturation has not been checked since March, and was normal then.  Ferritin has not been checked in a couple of months.,CURRENT MEDICATIONS: , Erythropoietin 45,000 units every week, started 05/16/2007.  She is on heparin flushes, loperamide, niacin, pantoprazole, Diovan, Afrin nasal spray, caspofungin, daptomycin, Ertapenem, fentanyl or morphine p.r.n. pain, and Compazine or Zofran p.r.n. nausea.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: ,GENERAL:  She is alert, and frustrated with her prolonged hospital stay.  She notes that she had epistaxis a few days ago, requiring nasal packing and fortunately that had resolved now.,VITAL SIGNS:  Today, temperature is 98.5, pulse 99, respirations 16, blood pressure 105/65, and pulse is 95.

Midline surgical scar has healed well, with a dressing in place in the middle, with no bleeding noted.,EXTREMITIES:  She has no peripheral edema.,CARDIAC:  Regular rate.,LYMPHATICS:  No adenopathy is noted.,LUNGS:  Clear bilaterally.,IMPRESSION AND PLAN:,  Markedly elevated PT/INR despite stopping Coumadin and administering vitamin K.  I will check mixing studies to see if she has deficiency, which could be due to poor production given her elevated LFTs, decreased albumin, and decreased pre-albumin.,It is possible that she has an inhibitor, which would have to be an acquired inhibitor, generally presenting with an elevated PTT and not PT.  I will check a PTT and check mixing studies if that is prolonged.  It is doubtful that she has a lupus anticoagulant since she has been presenting with bleeding symptoms rather than clotting.  I agree with continuing off of anticoagulation for now.,She has markedly elevated platelet count.  I suspect this is likely reactive to infection, and not from a new myeloproliferative disorder.,Anemia has been stable, and is multifactorial.  Given her decreased creatinine clearance, I agree with erythropoietin support.  She was iron deficient last year, and with her multiple surgeries and poor p.o. intake, may have become iron deficient again.  She has had part of her small bowel removed, so there may be a component of poor absorption as well.  If she is iron deficient, this may contribute also to her elevated platelet counts.  I will check a ferritin.  This may be difficult to interpret because of inflammation.  If it is decreased, plan will be to add iron supplementation intravenously.  If it is elevated, we could consider a bone marrow biopsy to evaluate her iron stores, and also assess her myelopoiesis given the markedly elevated platelet counts.,She needs continued treatment as you are for her infections.,I will discuss the case with Dr. X as well since there is a question as to whether she might need additional surgery.  She is not a surgical candidate now with her elevated PT/INR.',\n",

However, on exam unable to delineate the facial structures, but definite fetal malpresentation.  The fetal heart tones did start and it continued to have variable decelerations with contractions overall are reassuring.  The contraction pattern was inadequate.  It was discussed with the patient's family that in light of the physical exam and with the fetal malpresentation that a cesarean section will be recommended.  All the questions were answered.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , After informed consent was obtained in layman's terms, the patient was taken back to the operating suite and placed in the dorsal lithotomy position with a leftward tilt.  Prior to this, the spinal anesthesia was administered.  The patient was then prepped and draped.  A Pfannenstiel skin incision was made with the first scalpel and carried through to the underlying layer of fascia with the second scalpel.  The fascia was then incised in the midline and extended laterally using Mayo scissors.  The superior aspect of the rectus fascia was then grasped with Ochsners, tented up and the underlying layer of rectus muscle was dissected up bluntly as well as with Mayo scissors.  The superior portion and inferior portion of the rectus fascia was identified, tented up and the underlying layer of rectus muscle was dissected up bluntly as well as with Mayo scissors.  The rectus muscle was then separated in the midline.  The peritoneum was then identified, tented up with hemostats and entered sharply with Metzenbaum scissors.  The peritoneum was then gently stretched.  The vesicouterine peritoneum was then identified, tented up with an Allis and the bladder flap was created bluntly as well as using Metzenbaum scissors.  The uterus was entered with the second scalpel and large transverse incision.  This was then extended in upward and lateral fashion bluntly.  The infant was then delivered atraumatically.  The nose and mouth were suctioned.  The cord was then clamped and cut.  The infant was handed off to the awaiting pediatrician.  The placenta was then manually extracted.  The uterus was exteriorized and cleared of all clots and debris.  The uterine incision was then repaired using #0 chromic in a running fashion marking a U stitch.  A second layer of the same suture was used in an imbricating fashion to obtain excellent hemostasis.  The uterus was then returned to the anatomical position.  The abdomen and the gutters were cleared of all clots.  Again, the incision was found to be hemostatic.  The rectus muscle was then reapproximated with #2-0 Vicryl in a single interrupted stitch.  The rectus fascia was then repaired with #0 Vicryl in a running fashion locking the first stitch and first last stitch in a lateral to medial fashion.  This was palpated and the patient was found to be without defect and intact.  The skin was then closed with staples.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.

The patient complained of clicking noises and stiffness, which affected his daily activities of living.,PROCEDURE: , After all potential complications, risks as well as anticipated benefits of the above-named procedure was discussed at length, the patient's informed consent was obtained.,Operative extremities were then confirmed with the operating surgeons as well as the nursing staff, Department of Anesthesia, and the patient.  The patient was then transferred to preoperative area to operative suite #2 and placed on the operating room table in supine position.  All bony prominences were well padded at this time.  At this time, Department of Anesthesia administered general anesthetic to the patient.  The patient was allowed in DVT study and the right extremity was in the Esmarch study as well as the left.  The nonsterile tourniquet was then applied to the right upper thigh of the patient, but not inflated at this time.  The right lower extremity was sterilely prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  The right upper extremity was then elevated and exsanguinated using an Esmarch and the tourniquet was inflated using 325 mmHg.  The patient was a consideration for a unicompartmental knee replacement.  So, after all bony and soft tissue landmarks were identified, a limited midline longitudinal incision was made directly over the patella.  A sharp dissection was then taken down to the level of the fascia in line with the patella as well as the quadriceps tendon.  Next, a medial parapatellar arthrotomy was performed using the #10 blade scalpel.  Upon viewing of the articular surfaces, there was significant ware in the trochlear groove as well as the medial femoral condyle and it was elected to proceed with total knee replacement.  At this time, the skin incisions as well as the deep incisions were extended proximally and distally in a midline fashion.  Total incision now measured approximately 25 cm.  Retractors were placed.  Next, attention was directed to establishing medial and lateral flaps of the proximal tibia.  Reciprocating osteal elevator was used to establish soft tissue plane and then an electrocautery was then used to subperiosteal strip medially and laterally on the proximal tibia.  At this time, the patella was then everted.  The knee was flexed up to 90 degrees.  Next, using the large drill bit, the femoral canal was then opened in appropriate position.  The intramedullary sizing guide was then placed and the knee was sized to a size F. At this time, the three degrees external rotation holes were then drilled after carefully assessing the epicondylar access as well as the white sideline.  The guide was then removed.  The intramedullary guide was then placed with nails holding the guide in three degrees of external rotation.  Next, the anterior femoral resection guide was then placed and clamped into place using a pointed _________________ was then used to confirm that there would no notching performed.  Next, soft tissue retractors were placed and an oscillating saw was used to make the anterior femoral cut.  Upon checking, it was noted to be flat with no oscillations.  The anterior guide was then removed and the distal femoral resection guide was placed in five degrees of valgus.  It was secured in place using nails.  The intramedullary guide was then removed and the standard distal femoral cut was then made using oscillating saw.,This was then removed and the size F distal finishing femoral guide was then placed on the femur in proper position.  Bony and soft tissue landmarks were confirmed and the resection guide was then held in place using nail as well as spring screws.  Again, the collateral ligament retractors were then placed and the oscillating saw was used to make each of the anterior and posterior as well as each chamfer cut.  A reciprocating saw was then used to cut the trochlear cut and the peg holes were drilled as well.  The distal finishing guide was then removed and osteotome was then used to remove all resected bone.  The oscillating saw was then used to complete the femoral notch cut.  Upon viewing, there appeared to be proper amount of bony resection and all bone was removed completely.  There was no posterior osteophytes noted and no fragments to the posterior aspect.  Next, attention was directed towards the tibia.  The external tibial guide was reflected.  This was placed on the anterior tibia and held in place using nails after confirming the proper varus and valgus position.  The resection guide was then checked and appeared to be sufficient amount of resection in both medial and lateral condyles of the tibia.  Next, collateral ligament retractors were placed as well as McGill retractors for the PCL.  Oscillating saw was then used to make the proximal tibial cut.  Osteotome was used to remove this excess resected bone.  The laminar spreader was then used to check the flexion and extension.  The gaps appeared to be equal.  The external guide was then removed and trial components were placed to a size F femoral component and a 12 mm tibial component on a size 8 tray.  The knee was taken through range of motion and had very good flexion as well as full extension.  There appeared to be good varus and valgus stability as well.  Next, attention was directed towards the patella.  There noted to be a sufficient ware and it was selected to replace the patella.  It was sized with caliper, pre-cut and noted to be 26 mm depth.  The sizing guide was then used and a size 51 resection guide selected.  A 51 mm reamer was then placed and sufficient amount of patella was then removed.  The calcar was then used to check again and there was noted to be 15 mm remaining.  The 38 mm patella guide was then placed on the patella.  It was noted to be in proper size and the three drill holes for the pegs were used.  A trial component was then placed.  The knee was taken through range of motion.  There was noted to be some subluxation lateral to the patellar component and a lateral release was performed.  After this, the component appeared to be tracking very well.  There remained a good range of motion in the knee and extension as well as flexion.  At this time, an AP x-ray of the knee was taken with the trial components in place.  Upon viewing this x-ray, it appeared that the tibial cut was in neutral, all components in proper positioning.  The knee was then copiously irrigated and dried.  The knee was then flexed ___________ placed, and the peg drill guide was placed on the tibia in proper position, held in place with nails.,The four peg holes were then drilled.  The knee again was copiously irrigated and suction dried.  The final components were then selected again consisting of size F femoral components.  A peg size 8 tibial component, a 12 mm height articular surface, size blue, and a 38 mm 9.5 mm thickness All-Poly patella.  Polymethyl methacrylate was then prepared at this time.  The proximal tibia was dried and the cement was then pressed into place.  The cement was then placed on the backside of the tibial component and the tibial component was then impacted into proper positioning.  Next, the proximal femur was cleaned and dried.  Polymethyl methacrylate was placed on the resected portions of the femur as well as the backside of the femoral components.  This was then impacted in place as well.  At this time, all excess cement was removed from both the tibial and femoral components.  A size 12 mm trial tibial articular surface was then put in place.  The knee was reduced and held in loading position throughout the remaining drying position of the cement.  Next, the resected patella was cleaned and dried.  The cement was placed on the patella as well as the backside of the patellar component.  The component was then put in proper positioning and held in place with a clamp.  All excess polymethyl methacrylate was removed from this area as well.  This was held until the cement had hardened sufficiently.  Next, the knee was examined.  All excess cement was then removed.  The knee was taken through range of motion with sufficient range of motion as well as stability.  The final 12 mm height polyethylene tibial component was then put into place and snapped down in proper position.  Again range of motion was noted to be sufficient.  The knee was copiously irrigated and suction dried once again.  A drain was then placed within the knee.

He had epicardial pacing wires removed at the bedside.  Shortly afterwards, he began to feel lightheaded and became pale and diaphoretic.  He was immediately rushed to the operating room for cardiac tamponade following removal of epicardial pacing wires.  He was transported immediately and emergently and remained awake and alert throughout the time period inspite of hypotension with the systolic pressure in the 60s-70s.,DETAILS OF PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was taken emergently to the operating room and placed supine on the operating room table.  His chest was prepped and draped prior to induction under general anesthesia.  Incision was made through the previous median sternotomy chest incision.  Wires were removed in the usual manner and the sternum was retracted.  There were large amounts of dark blood filling the mediastinal chest cavity.  Large amounts of clot were also removed from the pericardial well and chest.  Systematic exploration of the mediastinum and pericardial well revealed bleeding from the right atrial appendix at the site of the previous cannulation.  This was repaired with two horizontal mattress pledgeted #5-0 Prolene sutures.  An additional #0 silk tie was also placed around the base of the atrial appendage for further hemostasis.  No other sites of bleeding were identified.  The mediastinum was then irrigated with copious amounts of antibiotic saline solution.  Two chest tubes were then placed including an angled chest tube into the pericardial well on the inferior border of the heart, as well as straight mediastinal chest tube.  The sternum was then reapproximated with stainless steel wires in the usual manner and the subcutaneous tissue was closed in multiple layers with running Vicryl sutures.

Suppression was attempted, however, unsuccessful.  She presents today with her thyroid goiter.  A thyroidectomy was indicated at this time secondary to the patient's chronic condition.  Indications, alternatives, risks, consequences, benefits, and details of the procedure including specifically the risk of recurrent laryngeal nerve paresis or paralysis or vocal cord dysfunction and possible trach were discussed with the patient in detail.  She agreed to proceed.  A full informed consent was obtained.,PROCEDURE: , The patient presented to ABCD General Hospital on 09/04/2003 with the history was reviewed and physical examinations was evaluated.  The patient was brought by the Department of Anesthesiology, brought back to surgical suite and given IV access and general endotracheal anesthesia.  A 9 cc of 1% lidocaine with 1:100,000 of epinephrine was infiltrated into the area of pre-demarcated above the suprasternal notch.  Time is allowed for full hemostasis to be achieved.  The patient was then prepped and draped in the normal sterile fashion.  A #10 blade was then utilized to make an incision in the pre-demarcated and anesthetized area.  Unipolar electrocautery was utilized for hemostasis.  Finger dissection was carried out in the superior and inferior planes.  Platysma was identified and dissected and a subplatysmal plane was created in the superior and inferior, medial and lateral directions using hemostat, Metzenbaum, and blunt dissection.  The strap muscles were identified.  The midline raphe was not easily identifiable at this time.  An incision was made through what appeared to be in the midline raphe and dissection was carried down to the thyroid.  Sternohyoid and sternothyroid muscles were identified and separated on the patient's right side and then subsequently on the left side.  It was noted at this time that the thyroid lobule on the right side is a bi-lobule.  Kitner blunt dissection was utilized to bluntly dissect the overlying thyroid fascia as well as strap muscles off the thyroid, force in the lateral direction.  This was carried down to the inferior and superior areas.  The superior pole of the right lobule was then identified.  A hemostat was placed in the cricothyroid groove and a Kitner was placed in this area.  A second Kitner was placed on lateral aspect of the superior pole and the superior pole of the right thyroid was retracted inferiorly.  Careful dissection was then carried out in a very meticulous fashion in the superior lobe and identified the appropriate vessels and cauterized with bipolar or ligated with the suture ligature.  This was carried out until the superior pole was identified.  Careful attention was made to avoid nerve injury in this area.  Dissection was then carried down again bluntly separating the inferior and superior lobes.  The bilobed right thyroid was then retracted medially.  The recurrent laryngeal nerve was then identified and tracked to its insertion.  The overlying vessels of the middle thyroid vein as well as the associated structures were then identified and great attention was made to perform a right careful meticulous dissection to remove the fascial attachments superficial to the recurrent laryngeal nerve off the thyroid.  When it was completed, this lobule was then removed from Berry's ligament.  There was noted to be no isthmus at this time and the entire right lobule was then sent to the Pathology for further evaluation.  Attention was then diverted to the patient's left side.  In a similar fashion, the sternohyoid and sternothyroid muscles were already separated.  Army-Navy as well as femoral retractors were utilized to lateralize the appropriate musculature.  The middle thyroid vein was identified.  Blunt dissection was carried out laterally to superiorly once again.  A hemostat was utilized to make an opening in the cricothyroid groove and a Kitner was then placed in this area.  Another Kitner was placed on the lateral aspect of the superior lobe of the left thyroid and retracted inferiorly.  Once again, a careful meticulous dissection was utilized to identify the appropriate structures in the superior pole of the left thyroid and suture ligature as well as bipolar cautery was utilized for hemostasis.  Once again, a careful attention was made not to injure the nerve in this area.  The superior pole was then freed appropriately and blunt dissection was carried down to lateral and inferior aspects.  The inferior aspect was then identified.  The inferior thyroid artery and vein were then identified and ligated.  The left thyroid was then medialized and the recurrent laryngeal nerve has been identified.  A careful dissection was then carried out to remove the fascial attachments superficial to the recurrent laryngeal nerve on the side as close to the thyroid gland as possible.  The thyroid was then removed from the Berry's ligament and it was then sent to Pathology for further evaluation.  Evaluation of the visceral space did not reveal any bleeding at this time.  This was irrigated and pinpoint areas were bipolored as necessary.  Surgicel was then placed bilaterally.  The strap muscles as well as the appropriate fascial attachments were then approximated with a #3-0 Vicryl suture in the midline.  The platysma was identified and approximated with a #4-0 Vicryl suture and the subdermal plane was approximated with a #4-0 Vicryl suture.  A running suture consisting of #5-0 Prolene suture was then placed and fast absorbing #6-0 was then placed in a running fashion.  Steri-Strips, Tincoban, bacitracin and a pressure gauze was then placed.  The patient was then admitted for further evaluation and supportive care.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.

Department of Anesthesia administered general anesthetic.  Once adequately anesthetized, the right lower extremity was placed in a Johnson knee holder.  Care was ensured that all bony prominences were well padded and she was positioned and secured.  After adequately positioned, the right lower extremity was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  Attention was then directed to creation of the arthroscopic portals, both medial and lateral portal were made for arthroscope and instrumentation respectively.  The arthroscope was advanced through the inferolateral portal taking in a suprapatellar pouch.  All compartments were then examined in sequential order with photodocumentation of each compartment.  The patella was noted to have grade-II changes of the inferior surface, otherwise appeared to track within the trochlear groove.  There was mild grooving of the trochlear cartilage.  The medial gutter was visualized.  There was no evidence of loose body.  The medial compartment was then entered.  There was noted to be a large defect on the medial femoral condyle grade III-IV chondromalacia changes with exposed bone in evidence of osteochondral displaced fragment.  There was also noted to be a degenerative meniscal tear of the posterior horn of the medial meniscus.  The arthroscopic probe was then introduced and the meniscus and chondral surfaces were probed throughout its entirety and photos were taken.  At this point, a meniscal shaver was then introduced and the chondral surfaces were debrided as well as any loose bodies removed.  This gave a smooth shoulder to the chondral lesion.  After this, the meniscus was debrided until it had been smooth over the frayed edges.  At this point, the shaver was removed.  The meniscal binder was then introduced and the meniscus was further debrided until the tear was adequately contained at this point.  The shaver was reintroduced and all particles were again removed and the meniscus was smoothed over the edge.  The probe was then reintroduced and the shaver removed, the meniscus was probed ___________ and now found to be stable.  At this point, attention was directed to the rest of the knee.  The ACL was examined.  It was intact and stable.  The lateral compartment was then entered.  There was noted to be a grade II-III changes of the lateral femoral condyle.  Again, with the edge of some friability at the shoulder of this cartilage lesion.  There was noted to be some mild degenerative fraying of the posterior horn of the lateral meniscus.  The probe was introduced and the remaining meniscus appeared stable.  This was then removed and the stapler was introduced.  A chondroplasty and meniscoplasty were then performed until adequately debrided and smoothed over.  The lateral gutter was then visualized.  There was no evidence of loose bodies.  Attention was then redirected back to the medial and femoral condyles.,At this point, a 0.62 K-wire was then placed in through the initial portal, medial portal, as well as an additional poke hole, so we can gain access and proper orientation to the medial femoral lesion.  Microfacial technique was then used to introduce the K-wire into the subchondral bone in multiple areas until we had evidence of some bleeding to allow ___________ of this lesion.  After this was performed, the shaver was then reintroduced and the loose bodies and loose fragments were further debrided.  At this point, the shaver was then moved to the suprapatellar pouch and the patellar chondroplasty was then performed until adequately debrided.  Again, all compartments were then re-visualized and there was no further evidence of other pathology or loose bodies.  The knee was then copiously irrigated and suctioned dry.  All instrumentation was removed.  Approximately 20 cc of 0.25% plain Marcaine was injected into the portal site and the remaining portion intraarticular.

The patient had marked hypertrophy of his nasalis muscle bilaterally contributing to the soft tissue dorsal hump.,3.  The patient had a C-shaped deformity to the left before he had tip ptosis.,INDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURE: , The patient is a 22-year-old Hispanic male who is status post blunt trauma to the nose approximately 9 months with the second episode 2 weeks following and suffered a marked dorsal deformity.  The patient was evaluated, but did not complain of nasal obstruction, and his main complaint was his cosmetic deformity.  He was found to have a C-shaped deformity to the left as well as some tip ptosis.  The patient was recommended to undergo an open septorhinoplasty to repair of this cosmetic defect.,OPERATION IN DETAIL: , After obtaining a full consent from the patient, identified the patient, prepped with Betadine, brought to the operating room and placed in the supine position on the operating table.  The appropriate Esmarch was placed; and after adequate sedation, the patient was subsequently intubated without difficulty.  The endotracheal tube was then secured, and the table was then turned clockwise to 90 degrees.  Three Afrin-soaked cottonoids were then placed in nasal cavity bilaterally.  The septum was then injected with 3 mL of 1% lidocaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine in the subperichondrial plane bilaterally.  Then, 50 additional mL of 1% lidocaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine was then injected into the nose in preparation for an open rhinoplasty.,Procedure was begun by first marking a columellar incision.  This incision was made using a #15 blade.  A lateral transfixion incision was then made bilaterally using a #15 blade, and then, the columellar incision was completed using iris scissors with care not to injure the medial crura.  However, there was a dissection injury to the left medial crura.  Dissection was then taken in the subperichondrial plane over the lower lateral cartilages and then on to the upper lateral cartilage.  Once we reached the nasal bone, a Freer was used to elevate the tissue overlying the nasal bone in a subperiosteal fashion.  Once we had completed exposure of the bony cartilaginous structures, we appreciated a very large dorsal hump, which was made up of both a cartilaginous and bony portions.  There was also an obvious fracture of the right upper lateral cartilage.  There was also marked hypertrophy what appeared to be in the nasalis muscle in the area of the dorsal hump.  The skin was contributing to the patient's cosmetic deformity.  In addition, we noted what appeared to be a small mucocele coming from the area of the fractured cartilage on the right upper lateral cartilage.  This mucocele was attempted to be dissected free, most of which was removed via dissection.  We then proceeded to remove takedown of the dorsal hump using a Rubin osteotome.  The dorsal hump was taken down and passed off the table.  Examination of the specimen revealed the marking amount of scar tissue at the junction of the bone and cartilage.  This was passed off to use later for possible onlay grafts.  There was now a marked open roof deformity of the cartilage and bony sprue.  A septoplasty was then performed throughout and a Kelly incision on the right side.  Subperichondrial planes were elevated on the right side, and then, a cartilage was incised using a caudal and subperichondrial plane elevated on the left side.  A 2 x 3-cm piece of the cardinal cartilage was then removed with care to leave at least 1 cm dorsal and caudal septal strut.  This cartilage was passed down the table and then 2 columellar strut grafts measuring approximately 15 mm in length were then used and placed to close the bony and cartilaginous open roof deformities.  The spreader grafts were sewn in place using three interrupted 5-0 PDS sutures placed in the horizontal fashion bilaterally.  Once these were placed, we then proceeded to work on the bony open roof.  Lateral osteotomies were made with 2-mm osteotomes bilaterally.  The nasal bones were then fashioned medially to close the open roof deformity, and this reduced the width of the bony nasal dorsum.  We then proceeded to the tip.  A cartilaginous strut was then fashioned from the cartilaginous septum.  It was approximately 15 mm long.  This was placed, and a pocket was just formed between the medial crura.  This pocket was taken down to the nasal spine, and then, the strut graft was placed.  The intradermal sutures were then placed using interrupted 5-0 PDS suture to help to provide more tip projection and definition.  The intradermal sutures were then placed to help to align the nasal tip.  The cartilage strut was then sutured in place to the medial crura after elevating the vestibular skin off the medial crura in the area of the plane suturing.  Prior to the intradermal suturing, the vestibular skin was also taken off in the area of the dome.,The columellar strut was then sutured in place using interrupted 5-0 PDS suture placed in a horizontal mattress fashion with care to help repair the left medial crural foot.  The patient had good tip support after this maneuver.  We then proceeded to repair the septal deformity created by taking down the dorsal hump with the Rubin osteotome.  This was done by crushing the remaining cartilage in the morcellizer and then wrapping this crushed cartilage in endogen, which is a radiated collagen.  The autogenous cartilage was wrapped in endogen in a sandwich fashion, and then, a 4-0 chromic suture was placed through this to help with placement of the dorsal onlay graft.,The dorsal onlay was then sewn into position, and then, the 4-0 chromic suture was brought out through this externally to help the superior placement of the dorsal onlay graft.  Once we were happy with the position of the dorsal onlay graft, the graft was then sutured in place using two interrupted 4-0 fast-absorbing sutures inferiorly just above the superior edge of the lower lateral cartilages.  Once we were happy with the placement of this, we did need to take down some of the bony dorsal hump laterally, and this was done using a #6 and then followed with a #3 push grafts.  This wrapping was performed prior to placement of the dorsal onlay graft.,I went through content with the dorsal onlay graft and the closure of the roof deformities as well as placement of the columellar strut, we then felt the patient could use a bit more tip projection; and therefore, we fashioned a radiated rib into a small octagon; and this was sutured in place over the tip using two interrupted 5-0 PDS sutures.,At this point, we were happy with the test results, although the patient did have significant amount of fullness in the dorsal hump area due to soft tissue thick and fullness.  There do not appear to be any other pathology causing the patient dorsal hump and therefore, we felt we have achieved the best cosmetic result at this point.  The septum was reapproximated using a fast-absorbing 4-0 suture and a Keith needle placed in the mattress fashion.  The Kelly incision was closed using two interrupted 4-0 fast-absorbing gut suture.  Doyle splints were then placed within the nasal cavity and secured to the inferior septum using a 3-0 monofilament suture.  The columellar skin was reapproximated using interrupted 6-0 nylon sutures, and the marginal incision of the vestibular skin was closed using interrupted 4-0 chromic sutures.,At the end of the procedure, all sponge, needle, and instrument counts were correct.  A Denver external splint was then applied.  The patient was awakened, extubated, and transported to Anesthesia Care Unit in good condition.\",\n",

Nephrolithotomy.,DIAGNOSIS:,  Right ureteropelvic junction obstruction.,DRAINS:,1.  Jackson-Pratt drain times one from the right flank.,2.  Foley catheter times one.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: , Less than 30 cc.,COMPLICATIONS: , None.,SPECIMENS:,1.  Renal pelvis.,2.  Kidney stones.,INDICATIONS:  ,The patient is a 30-year-old Caucasian gentleman with history of hematuria subsequently found to have right renal stones and patulous right collecting system with notable two right crossing renal arteries.  Up on consideration of various modalities and therapy, the patient decided to undergo surgical therapy.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:  ,The patient was verified by armband and the procedure being robotic-assisted right pyeloplasty with nephrolithotomy was verified, and the procedure was carried out.  After institution of general endotracheal anesthesia and intravenous preoperative antibiotics, the patient was positioned into the right flank position with his right flank elevated.  Great care was taken to pad all pressure points and a right arm hanger was used.  The patient was flexed slightly, and a kidney rest was used.  Sequential compression devices were also placed.  Next, the patient was prepped and draped in normal sterile fashion with povidone-iodine.  Pneumoperitoneum was obtained by placing a Veress needle in the area of the umbilicus after it passed the water test.  A low pressure, high flow pneumoperitoneum was adequately obtained using CO2 gas.  Next, a 12-mm camera port was placed near the umbilicus.  The camera was inserted, and no bowel injury was seen.  Next, under direct vision flanking 8 mm camera ports, a 12 mm assist port, a 5 mm liver retraction port, and 5 mm assist port were placed.  The robot was docked and the instruments passed through respective checks.  Initial attention was directed to mobilizing the right colon from the abdominal wall totally medially.  Next, the right lateral duodenum was cauterized for further access to the right retroperitoneum.  At this point, the right kidney was in clear view, and the fascia was entered.  Initial attention was directed at careful dissection of the renal pelvis and proximal ureter which was done with a combination of electrocautery and blunt dissection.  It became readily apparent that there were two crossing vessels one in the medial inferior region of the kidney and another one in the most inferior portion of the lower pole.  These arteries were dissected carefully and vessel loops were applied.  Next, a small hole was then made in the renal pelvis using electrocautery and the contents of the renal pelvis were suctioned out.  The pyelotomy was extended so that the renal collecting system could be directly inspected.  Sequentially, each major calyx was inspected under direct vision and irrigated.  A total of four round kidney stones were extracted to be sent for analysis to being satisfied for the patient.  At this point, we directed our attention at the proximal right ureter which was dismembered from the remaining renal pelvis.  The proximal ureter was spatulated using cold scissors.  Next, redundant renal pelvis was excised using cold scissors and sent for permanent section.  We then identified the most inferior/dependent portion of the renal pelvis and placed a heel stitch at this for ureteral-renal pelvis anastomosis in a semi running fashion.  3-0 Monocryl sutures were used to re-anastomose the newly spatulated right ureter to the inferior portion of the renal pelvis.  Next, remainder of the pyelotomy was closed to itself also using 2-0 Monocryl sutures.  Before final stitches were placed, a 6x28 ureteral stent was placed anterograde.  This was accomplished by placing the stents over a guidewire, placing the guidewire under direct vision anterograde through the ureter.  This was done until the proximal end was in the renal pelvis, the guidewire was removed, and good proximal curl was verified by direct vision.  Then, the pyelotomy was completely closed again with 2-0 Monocryl sutures.  Next, attention was directed at transposition of the crossing renal artery by fixing it with Vicryl suture that would impinge less upon the renal pelvis.  Good pulsation was verified by direct vision proximal and distal to these pexy sutures.  Next, Gerota's fascia was reapproximated and closed with Vicryl sutures as was the right peritoneum.  Hemostasis appeared excellent at this point.  There was no obvious urine extravasation.  At this time, the procedure was terminated.  The robot was undocked.  Under direct visualization all 8 and 12 mm ports were closed at the level of the fascia with 0 Vicryl sutures in an interrupted fashion.  Then, all skin port sites were closed with 4-0 Monocryl in a subcuticular fashion and Dermabond and band-aids were applied over this.  Also, notably a Jackson-Pratt drain was placed in the area of the right kidney and additional right flank stab incision.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and no immediate perioperative complication was noted.,DISPOSITION: , The patient was discharged to Post Anesthesia Care Unit and subsequently to genitourinary floor to begin his recovery.\",\n",
       " \"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Rotator cuff tear, right shoulder.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Superior labrum anterior and posterior lesion (peel-back), right shoulder.,PROCEDURE PERFORMED:,1.  Arthroscopy with arthroscopic SLAP lesion.,2.  Repair of soft tissue subacromial decompression rotator cuff repair, right shoulder.,SPECIFICATIONS: , The entire operative procedure was done in Inpatient Operating Suite, room #1 at ABCD General Hospital.  This was done under a interscalene block anesthetic and subsequent general anesthetic in the modified beachchair position.,HISTORY AND GROSS FINDINGS:  ,This is a 54-year-old white female suffering an increasing right shoulder pain for a few months prior to surgical intervention.  She had an injury to her right shoulder when she fell off a bike.  She was diagnosed preoperatively with a rotated cuff tear.,Intra-articularly besides we noted a large SLAP lesion, superior and posterior to the attachment of the glenoid labrum from approximately 12:30 back to 10:30.  This acted as a peel-back type of mechanism and was displaced into the joint beyond the superior rim of the glenoid.  This was an obvious avulsion into subchondral bone with bone exposed.  The anterior aspect had degenerative changes, but did not have evidence of avulsion.  The subscapular was noted to be intact.  On the joint side of the supraspinatus, there was noted to be a laminated type of tearing to the rotated cuff to the anterior and mid-aspect of the supraspinatus attachment.,This was confirmed subacromially.  The patient had a type-I plus acromion in outlet view and thus it was elected to not perform a subacromial decompression, but soft tissue release of the CA ligament in a releasing resection type fashion.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE: , The patient was placed supine upon the operative table after she was given interscalene and then general anesthesia by the Anesthesia Department.  She was safely placed in a modified beachchair position.  She was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.  The portals were created from outside the ends, posterior to the scope and anteriorly for an intraoperative portal and then laterally.  She had at least two other portals appropriate for both repair mechanisms described above.,Attention was then turned to the SLAP lesion.  The edges were debrided both on the bony side as well as soft tissue side.  We used the anterior portal to lift up the mechanism and created a superolateral portal through the rotator cuff and into the edge of the labrum.  Further debridement was carried out here.  A drill hole was made just on the articular surface superiorly for a knotless anchor.  A pull-through suture of #2 fiber wire was utilized with the ________.  This was pulled through.  It was tied to the leader suture of the knotless anchor.  This was pulled through and one limb of the anchor loop was grabbed and the anchor impacted with a mallet.  There was excellent fixation of the superior labrum.  It was noted to be solid and intact.  The anchor was placed safely in the bone.  There was no room for further knotless or other anchors.  After probing was carried out, hard copy Polaroid was obtained.,Attention was then turned to the articular side for the rotator cuff.  It was debrided.  Subchondral debridement was carried out to the tuberosity also.  Care was taken to go to the subchondral region but not beyond.  The bone was satisfactory.,Scope was then placed in the subacromial region.  Gross bursectomy was carried out with in the lateral portal.  This was done throughout as well as in the gutters anterolaterally and posteriorly.  Debridement was carried out further to the rotator cuff.  Two types of fixation were carried out, one with a superolateral portal a drill hole was made and anchor of the _knotless suture placed after PDS leader suture placed with a Caspari punch.  There was an excellent reduction of the tear posteriorly and then anteriorly.  Tendon to tendon repair was accomplished by placing a fiber wire across the tendon and tying sutured down through the anterolateral portal.  This was done with a sliding stitch and then two half stitches.  There was excellent reduction of the tear.,Attention was then turned to the CA ligament.  It was released along with periosteum and the undersurface of the anterior acromion.  The CA ligament was not only released but resected.  There was noted to be no evidence of significant spurring with only a mostly type-I acromion.  Thus, it was not elected to perform subacromial decompression for bone with soft tissue only.  A pain buster catheter was placed separately.  It was cut to length.  An interrupted #4-0 nylon was utilized for portal closure.  A 0.5% Marcaine was instilled subacromially.  Adaptic, 4x4s, ABDs, and Elastoplast tape placed for dressing.  The patient's arm was placed in a arm sling.  She was transferred to PACU in apparent satisfactory condition.  Expected surgical prognosis on this patient is fair.\",\n",
       " \"REASON FOR REFERRAL: , Cardiac evaluation and treatment in a patient who came in the hospital with abdominal pain.,HISTORY:,  This is a 77-year-old white female patient whom I have known for the last about a year or so who has underlying multiple medical problems including hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease status post aortocoronary bypass surgery about eight years ago at Halifax Medical Center where she had triple vessel bypass surgery with left internal mammary artery to the left anterior descending artery, saphenous vein graft to the left circumflex and right coronary arteries.  Since then, she has generally done well.  She used to be seeing another cardiologist and apparently she had a stress test in September 2008 and she was otherwise cardiac catheterization and coronary angiography, but the patient declined to have one done and since then she has been on medical therapy.,The patient had been on medical therapy at home and generally doing well.  Recently, she had no leg swelling, undue exertional dyspnea, orthopnea, or paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea.  She denies any rest or exertional chest discomfort.  Yesterday evening, she had her dinner and she was sitting around and she felt discomfort in the chest at about 7:00 p.m.  The discomfort was a crampy pain in the left lower quadrant area, which seemed to radiating to the center of the abdomen and to the right side and it was off and on lasting for a few minutes at a time and then subsiding.  Later on she was nauseous, but she did not have any vomiting.  She denied any diarrhea.  No history of fever or chills.  Since the pain seemed to persist, the patient came to the hospital emergency room at 11:35 p.m. where she was seen and admitted for the same.  She was given morphine, Zofran, Demerol, another Zofran, and Reglan as well as Demerol again and she was given intravenous fluids.  Subsequently, her pain finally went away and she does not have any pain since about 7:00 a.m. this morning.  The patient was admitted however for further workup and treatment.  At the time of my examination this afternoon, the patient is sitting, lying in bed and comfortable and has no abdominal pain of any kind.  She has not been fed any food, however.  The patient also had had pelvis and abdominal CT scan performed, which has been described to be partial small bowel obstruction, internal hernia, volvulus or adhesion most likely in the left flank area.  The patient has had left nephrectomy and splenectomy, which has been described.  A 1.5-mm solid mass is described to be in the lower pole of the kidney.  The patient also has been described to have diverticulosis without diverticulitis on this finding.,Currently however, the patient has no clinical symptoms according to her.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:,  She has had hypertension and hyperlipidemia for the last 15 years, diabetes mellitus for the last eight years, and coronary artery disease for last about eight years or so.

No history of TIA or CVA.  She has one kidney.  She was in a car accident in 1978 and afterwards she had to have left nephrectomy as well as splenectomy because of rupture.  The patient has a history of pulmonary embolism once about eight years ago after her aortocoronary bypass surgery.  She describes this to be a clot on left lung.  I am not sure if she had any long-term treatment, however.,In the past, the patient had aortocoronary bypass surgery in 2003 and incisional hernia surgery in 1979 as well as hysterectomy in 1979 and she had splenectomy and nephrectomy as described in 1978.,FAMILY HISTORY: , Her father died at age of 65 of massive heart attack and mother died at age of 62 of cancer.

The patient was taken to Postanesthesia Care Unit in stable condition.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.,INDICATIONS: , The patient is a 55-year-old female who has had increased pain in to her right shoulder.  X-rays as well as an MRI showed a severe arthritic presentation of the humeral head with mild arthrosis of the glenoid.  She had an intact rotator cuff being at a young age and with potential of glenoid thus it was felt that a hemi-resurfacing was appropriate for her right shoulder focusing in the humeral head.  All risks, benefits, expectations and complications of surgery were explained to her in detail including nerve and vessel damage, infection, potential for hardware failure, the need for revision surgery with potential of some problems even with surgical intervention.  The patient still wanted to proceed forward with surgical intervention.  The patient did receive 1 g of Ancef preoperatively.,PROCEDURE: , The patient was taken to the operating suite, placed in supine position on the operating table.  The Department of anesthesia administered a general endotracheal anesthetic, which the patient tolerated well.  The patient was moved to a beach chair position.  All extremities were well padded.  Her head was well padded to the table.  Her right upper extremity was draped in sterile fashion.  A saber incision was made from the coracoid down to the axilla.  Skin was incised down to the subcutaneous tissue, the cephalic vein was retracted as well as all neurovascular structures were retracted in the case.  Dissecting through the deltopectoral groove, the subscapularis tendon was found as well as the bicipital tendon, 1 finger breadth medial to the bicipital tendon an incision was made.  Subscapularis tendon was released.  The humeral head was brought in to; there were large osteophytes that were removed with an osteotome.  The glenoid then was evaluated and noted to just have mild arthrosis, but there was no need for surgical intervention in this region.  A sizer was placed.  It was felt that size 5 was appropriate for this patient, after which the guide was used to place the stem and pin.  This was placed, after which a reamer was placed along the humeral head and reamed to a size 5.  All extra osteophytes were excised.  The supraspinatus and infraspinatus tendons were intact.  Next, the excess bone was removed and irrigated after which reaming of the central portion of the humeral head was performed of which a trial was placed and showed that there was adequate fit and appropriate fixation.  The arm had excellent range of motion.  There are no signs of gross dislocation.  Drill holes were made into the humeral head after which a size 5 Copeland hemi-resurfacing component was placed into the humeral head, kept down in appropriate position, had excellent fixation into the humeral head.  Excess bone that had been reamed was placed into the Copeland metal component, after which this was tapped into position.  After which the wound site was copiously irrigated with saline and antibiotics and the humeral head was reduced and taken through range of motion; had adequate range of motion, full internal and external rotation as well as forward flexion and abduction.  There was no gross sign of dislocation.  Wound site once again it was copiously irrigated with saline antibiotics.  The subscapularis tendon was approximated back into position with #2 Ethibond after which the bicipital tendon did have significant tear to it; therefore it was tenodesed in to the pectoralis major tendon.  After which, the wound site again was irrigated with saline antibiotics after which subcutaneous tissue was approximated with 2-0 Vicryl.  The skin was closed with staples.  A sterile dressing was placed.  The patient was awakened from general anesthetic and transferred to hospital gurney to the postanesthesia care unit in stable condition.',\n",

The patient was brought to the minor procedure area and sedated per their protocol.  The patient was positioned lying supine.  Skin overlying all areas injected was prepped with chlorhexidine.  The obturator nerves were identified lateral to the adductor longus tendon origin and below the femoral pulse using active EMG stimulation.  Approximately 7 mL was injected on the right side and 5 mL on the left side.  At all sites of phenol injections in this area injections were done at the site of maximum hip adduction contraction with least amount of stimulus.  Negative drawback for blood was done prior to each injection of phenol.  The musculocutaneous nerve was identified in the left upper extremity above the brachial pulse using active EMG stimulation.  Approximately 5 mL of 5% phenol was injected in this location.  Injections in this area were done at the site of maximum elbow flexion contraction with least amount of stimulus.  Negative drawback for blood was done prior to each injection of phenol.,Muscles injected with botulinum toxin were identified using active EMG stimulation.  Approximately 150 units was injected in the knee extensors bilaterally, 100 units in the left pectoralis major, and 50 units in the left wrist flexors.  Total amount of botulinum toxin injected was 450 units diluted 25 units to 1 mL.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and no complications were encountered.\",\n",
       " 'CC: ,Paraplegia.,HX:, This 32 y/o RHF had been performing missionary work in Jos, Nigeria for several years and delivered her 4th child by vaginal delivery on 4/10/97. The delivery was induced with Pitocin, but was otherwise uncomplicated. For the first 4 days post-partum she noted clear liquid diarrhea without blood and minor abdominal discomfort. This spontaneous resolved without medical treatment. The second week post-partum she had 4-5 days of sinusitis, purulent nasal discharge and facial pain. She was otherwise well until 5/4/97 when stationed in a more rural area of Nigeria, she noted a dull ache in both knees (lateral to the patellae) and proximal tibia, bilaterally. The pain was not relieved by massage and seemed more bothersome when seated or supine. She had no sensory loss at the time.,On 5/6/97, she awakened to pain radiating down her knees to her anterior tibia. Over the next few hours the pain radiated circumferentially around both calves, and involved the soles of her feet and posterior BLE to her buttocks. Rising from bed became a laborious task and she required assistance to walk to the bathroom. Ibuprofen provided minimal analgesia. By evening the sole of one foot was numb.,She awoke the next morning, 5/9/97, with \"pins & needles\" sensation in BLE up to her buttocks. She was given Darvocet for analgesia and took an airplane back to the larger city she was based in. During the one hour flight her BLE weakness progressed to a non-weight bearing state (i.e. she could not stand). Local evaluation revealed 3/3 proximal and 4/4 distal BLE weakness. She had a sensory level to her waist on PP and LT testing. She also had mild lumbar back pain. Local laboratory evaluation: WBC 12.7, ESR 10. She was presumed to have Guillain-Barre syndrome and was placed on Solu-Cortef 1000mg qd and Sandimmune IV IgG 12.0 g.,On 5/10/97, she was airlifted to Geneva, Switzerland. Upon arrival there she had total anesthesia from the feet up to the inguinal region, bilaterally. There was flaccid areflexic paralysis of BLE and she was unable to void or defecate. Straight catheterization of the bladder revealed a residual volume of 1000cc. On 5/12/ CSF analysis revealed: Protein 1.5g/l, Glucose 2.2mmol/l, WBC 92 (O PMNS, 100% Lymphocytes), RBC 70, Clear CSF, bacterial-fungal-AFB-cultures were negative. Broad spectrum antibiotics and Solu-Medrol 1g IV qd were started. MRI T-L-spine, 5/12/97 revealed an intradural T12-L1 lesion that enhanced minimally with gadolinium and was associated with spinal cord edema in the affected area. MRI Brain, 5/12/97, was unremarkable and showed no evidence of demyelinating disease. HIV, HTLV-1, HSV, Lyme, EBV, Malaria and CMV serological titers were negative. On 5/15/97 the Schistosomiasis Mekongi IFAT serological titer returned positive at 1:320 (normal<1:80). 5/12/97 CSF Schistosomiasis Mekongi IFAT and ELISA were negative. She was then given a one day course of Praziquantel 3.6g total in 3 doses; and started on Prednisone 60 mg po qd; the broad spectrum antibiotics and Solu-Medrol were discontinued.,On 5/22/97, a rectal biopsy was performed to evaluate parasite eradication. The result came back positive for ova and granulomata after she had left for UIHC. The organism was not speciated. 5/22/97 CSF schistosomiasis ELISA and IFAT titers were positive at 1.09 and 1:160, respectively.

       " 'PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:,  Empyema of the left chest and consolidation of the left lung.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:,  Empyema of the left chest, consolidation of the left lung, lung abscesses of the left upper lobe and left lower lobe.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE: , Left thoracoscopy and left thoracotomy with declaudication and drainage of lung abscesses, and multiple biopsies of pleura and lung.,ANESTHESIA:,  General.,FINDINGS: , The patient has a complex history, which goes back about four months ago when she started having respiratory symptoms and one week ago she was admitted to another hospital with hemoptysis and on her evaluation there which included two CAT scans of chest she was found to have marked consolidation of the left lung with a questionable lung abscess or cavity with hydropneumothorax.  There was also noted to be some mild infiltrates of the right lung.  The patient had a 30-year history of cigarette smoking.  A chest tube was placed at the other hospital, which produced some brownish fluid that had foul odor, actually what was thought to be a fecal-like odor.  Then an abdominal CT scan was done, which did not suggest any communication of the bowel into the pleural cavity or any other significant abnormalities in the abdomen on the abdominal CT.  The patient was started on antibiotics and was then taken to the operating room, where there was to be a thoracoscopy performed.  The patient had a flexible fiberoptic bronchoscopy that showed no endobronchial lesions, but there was bloody mucous in the left main stem bronchus and this was suctioned out.  This was suctioned out with the addition of the use of saline ***** in the bronchus.  Following the bronchoscopy, a double lumen tube was placed, but it was not possible to secure the double lumen to the place so we did not proceed with the thoracoscopy on that day.,The patient was transferred for continued evaluation and treatment.  Today, the double lumen tube was placed and there was some erythema of the mucosa noted in the airways in the bronchi and also remarkably bloody secretions were also noted.  These were suctioned, but it was enough to produce a temporary obstruction of the left mainstem bronchus.  Eventually, the double lumen tube was secured and an attempt at a left thoracoscopy was performed after the chest tube was removed and digital dissection was carried out through that.  The chest tube tract, which was about in the sixth or seventh intercostal space, but it was not possible to dissect enough down to get a acceptable visualization through this tract.  A second incision for thoracoscopy was made about on the sixth intercostal space in the midaxillary line and again some digital dissection was carried out but it was not enough to be able to achieve an opening or space for satisfactory inspection of the pleural cavity.  Therefore the chest was opened and remarkable findings included a very dense consolidation of the entire lung such that it was very hard and firm throughout.  Remarkably, the surface of the lower lobe laterally was not completely covered with a fibrotic line, but it was more the line anterior and posterior and more of it over the left upper lobe.  There were many pockets of purulent material, which had a gray-white appearance to it.  There was quite a bit of whitish fibrotic fibrinous deposit on the parietal pleura of the lung especially the upper lobe.  The adhesions were taken down and they were quite bloody in some areas indicating that the process had been present for some time.  There seemed to be an abscess that was about 3 cm in dimension, all the lateral basilar segment of the lower lobe near the area where the chest tube was placed.  Many cultures were taken from several areas.  The most remarkable finding was a large cavity, which was probably about 11 cm in dimension, containing grayish pus and also caseous-like material, it was thought to be perhaps necrotic lung tissue, perhaps a deposit related to tuberculosis in the cavity.,The apex of the lung was quite densely adhered to the parietal pleura there and the adhesions were quite thickened and firm.,PROCEDURE AND TECHNIQUE:,  With the patient lying with the right side down on the operating table the left chest was prepped and draped in sterile manner.  The chest tube had been removed and initially a blunt dissection was carried out through the old chest tube tract, but then it was necessary to enlarge it slightly in order to get the Thoracoport in place and this was done and as mentioned above we could not achieve the satisfactory visualization through this.  Therefore, the next incision for Thoracoport and thoracoscopy insertion through the port was over the sixth intercostal space and a little bit better visualization was achieved, but it was clear that we would be unable to complete the procedure by thoracoscopy.  Therefore posterolateral thoracotomy incision was made, entering the pleural space and what is probably the sixth intercostal space.  Quite a bit of blunt and sharp and electrocautery dissection was performed to take down adhesions to the set of the fibrinous deposit on the pleural cavity.  Specimens for culture were taken and specimens for permanent histology were taken and a frozen section of one of the most quite dense.  Suture ligatures of Prolene were required.  When the cavity was encountered it was due to some compression and dissection of some of the fibrinous deposit in the upper lobe laterally and anterior and this became identified as a very thin layer in one area over this abscess and when it was opened it was quite large and we unroofed it completely and there was bleeding down in the depths of the cavity, which appeared to be from pulmonary veins and these were sutured with a \"tissue pledget\" of what was probably intercostal nozzle and endothoracic fascia with Prolene sutures.,Also as the upper lobe was retracted in caudal direction the tissue was quite dense and the superior branch of the pulmonary artery on the left side was torn and for hemostasis a 14-French Foley catheter was passed into the area of the tear and the balloon was inflated, which helped establish hemostasis and suturing was carried out again with utilizing a small pledget what was probably intercostal muscle and endothoracic fascia and this was sutured in place and the Foley catheter was removed.  The patch was sutured onto the pulmonary artery tear.  A similar maneuver was utilized on the pulmonary vein bleeding site down deep in the cavity.  Also on the pulmonary artery repair some ***** material was used and also thrombin, Gelfoam and Surgicel.  After reasonably good hemostasis was established pleural cavity was irrigated with saline.  As mentioned, biopsies were taken from multiple sites on the pleura and on the edge and on the lung.  Then two #24 Blake chest tubes were placed, one through a stab wound above the incision anteriorly and one below and one in the inferior pleural space and tubes were brought out through stab wounds necked into the skin with 0 silk.  One was positioned posteriorly and the other anteriorly and in the cephalad direction of the apex.  These were later connected to water-seal suction at 40 cm of water with negative pressure.,Good hemostasis was observed.  Sponge count was reported as being correct.  Intercostal nerve blocks at probably the fifth, sixth, and seventh intercostal nerves was carried out.  Then the sixth rib had been broken and with retraction the fractured ends were resected and rongeur used to smooth out the end fragments of this rib.  Metallic clip was passed through the rib to facilitate passage of an intracostal suture, but the bone was partially fractured inferiorly and it was very difficult to get the suture out through the inner cortical table, so that pericostal sutures were used with #1 Vicryl.  The chest wall was closed with running #1 Vicryl and then 2-0 Vicryl subcutaneous and staples on the skin.  The chest tubes were connected to water-seal drainage with 40 cm of water negative pressure.  Sterile dressings were applied.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and was turned in the supine position where the double lumen endotracheal tube was switched out with single lumen.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and was taken to the intensive care unit in satisfactory condition.',\n",

Monitors placed, including EKG, Pulse oximeter, and BP cuff.  Patient had a pillow placed under the shoulder blades.  The head and neck was allowed to fall back into hyperextension.  The neck region was prepped and draped in sterile fashion with Betadine and alcohol.  Four sterile towels were placed.  The cricothyroid membrane was palpated, then going one finger's breadth lateral from the cricothyroid membrane and one finger's breadth inferior, the carotid pulse was palpated and the sheath was retracted laterally.  A 22 gauge SMK 5-mm bare tipped needle was then introduced in between the cricothyroid membrane and the carotid sheath and directed inferiomedially.  The needle is advanced prudently through the tissues, avoiding the carotid artery laterally.  The tip of the needle is perceived to intersect with the vertebral body of Cervical #7 and this was visualized by fluoroscopy.  Aspiration was cautiously performed after the needle was retracted approximately 1 mm and held steady with left hand.  No venous or arterial blood return is noted.  No cerebral spinal fluid is noted.  Positive sensory stimulation was elicited using the Radionics unit at 50 Hz from 0-0.1 volts and negative motor stimulation was elicited from 1-10 volts at 2 Hz.  After negative aspiration through the 22 gauge SMK 5mm bare tipped needle is absolutely confirmed, 5 cc of solution (solution consisting of 5 cc of 0.5% Marcaine, 1 cc of triamcinolone) was then injected into the stellate ganglion region.  This was done with intermittent aspiration vigilantly verifying negative aspiration.  The stylet was then promptly replaced and neurolysis (nerve decompression) was then carried out for 60 seconds at 80 degrees centigrade.  This exact same procedure using the exact same protocol was repeated one more time to complete the two lesions of the stellate ganglion.  The patient was immediately placed in the sitting position to reduce any side effect from the stellate ganglion block associated with cephalad spread of the solution.  Pressure was placed over the puncture site for approximately five minutes to eliminate any hemorrhage from blood vessels that may have been punctured and a Band-Aid was placed over the puncture site.  Patient was monitored for an additional ten to fifteen minutes and was noted to have tolerated the procedure well without any adverse sequelae.  Significant temperature elevation was noted on the affected side verifying neurolysis of the ganglion.  ,Interpretation of radiograph reveals placement of the 22-gauge SMK 5-mm bare tipped needle in the region of the stellate ganglion on the affected side.

Impingement syndrome.,ANESTHESIA: , General,NAME OF OPERATION:,1.  Arthroscopic subacromial decompression.,2.  Repair of rotator cuff through mini-arthrotomy.,FINDINGS AT OPERATION: , The patient's glenohumeral joint was completely clear, other than obvious tear of the rotator cuff.  The midportion of this appeared to be complete, but for the most part, this was about a 60% rupture of the tendon.  This was confirmed later when the bursal side was opened up.  Note, the patient also had abrasion of the coracoacromial ligament under the anterolateral edge of the acromion.  He did not have any acromioclavicular joint pain or acromioclavicular joint disease noted.,PROCEDURE:,  He was given an anesthetic, examined, prepped, and draped in a sterile fashion in a beach-chair position.  The shoulder was instilled with fluid from posteriorly, followed by the arthroscope.  The shoulder was instilled with fluid from posteriorly, followed by the arthroscope.  Arthroscopy was then carried out in standard fashion using a 30-degree Dionic scope.  With the scope in the posterior portal, the above findings were noted, and an anterior portal was established.  A curved shaver was placed for debridement of the tear.  I established this was about a 60-70% tear with a probable complete area of tear which was very small.  There were no problems at the biceps or the rest of the joint.  The subacromial space showed findings, as noted above, and a thorough subacromial decompression was carried out with a Bovie, rotary shaver, and bur.  I did not debride the acromioclavicular joint.  The lateral portal was then extended to a mini-arthrotomy, and subacromial space was entered by blunt dissection through the deltoid.  The area of weakness of the tendon was found, and was transversely cut, and findings were confirmed.  The diseased tissue was removed, and the greater tuberosity was abraded with a rongeur.  Tendon-to-tendon repair was then carried out with buried sutures of 2-0 Ethibond, giving a very nice repair.  The shoulder was carried through a range of motion.  I could see no evidence of impingement.  Copious irrigation was carried out.  The deltoid deep fascia was anatomically closed, as was the superficial fascia.  The subcutaneous tissue and skin were closed in layers.  A sterile dressing was applied.  The patient appeared to tolerate the procedure well.\",\n",

He understands.  All questions answered and is willing to sign consent.,PROCEDURE PERFORMED:,  Selective coronary angiography of the right coronary artery, left main LAD, left circumflex artery, left ventricular catheterization, left ventricular angiography, angioplasty of totally occluded mid RCA, arthrectomy using 6-French catheter, stenting of the mid RCA, stenting of the proximal RCA, femoral angiography and Perclose hemostasis.,NARRATIVE: , The patient was brought to the cardiac catheterization laboratory in a fasting state.  Both groins were draped and sterilized in the usual fashion.  Local anesthesia was achieved with 2% lidocaine to the right groin area and a #6-French femoral sheath was inserted via modified Seldinger technique in the right common femoral artery.  Selective coronary angiography was performed with #6 French JL4 catheter for the left coronary system and a #6 French JR4 catheter of the right coronary artery.  Left ventricular catheterization and angiography was performed at the end of the procedure with a #6-French angle pigtail catheter.,FINDINGS,1.  Hemodynamics systemic blood pressure 140/70 mmHg.  LVEDP at the end of the procedure was 13 mmHg.,2.  The left main coronary artery is a large with mild diffuse disease in the distal third resulting in less than 20% angiographic stenosis at the take off of the left circumflex artery.  The left circumflex artery is a large caliber vessel with diffuse disease in the ostium of the proximal segment resulting in less than 30% angiographic stenosis.  The left circumflex artery gives rise to a high small obtuse marginal branch that has high moderate-to-severe ostium.  The rest of the left circumflex artery has mild diffuse disease and it gives rise to a second large obtuse marginal branch that bifurcates into an upper and lower trunk.,The LAD is calcified and diffusely disease in the proximal and mid portion.  There is mild nonobstructive disease in the proximal LAD resulting in less than 20% angiographic stenosis.,3.  The right coronary artery is dominant.  It is septal to be occluded in the mid portion.,The findings were discussed with the patient and she opted for PCI.  Angiomax bolus was started.  The ACT was checked.  It was higher in 300.  I have given the patient 600 mg of oral Plavix.,The right coronary artery was engaged using a #6-French JR4 guide catheter.  I was unable to cross through this lesion using a BMW wire and a 3.0x8 mm balloon support.  I was unable to cross with this lesion using a whisper wire.  I was unable to cross with this lesion using Cross-IT 100 wire.  I have also used second #6-French Amplatz right I guide catheter.  At one time, I have lost flow in the distal vessel.  The patient experienced severe chest pain, ST-segment elevation, bradycardia, and hypotension, which responded to intravenous fluids and atropine along with intravenous dopamine.,Dr. X was notified.,Eventually, an Asahi grand slam wire using the same 3.0 x 8 mm Voyager balloon support, I was able to cross into the distal vessel.  I have performed careful balloon angioplasty of the mid RCA.  I have given nitroglycerin under the nursing several times during the procedure.,I then performed arthrectomy using #5-French export catheter.,I performed more balloon predilation using a 3.0 x16 mm Voyager balloon.  I then deployed 4.0 x15 mm, excised, and across the mid RCA at 18 atmospheres with good angiographic result.  Proximal to the proximal edge of the stent, there was still some persistent haziness most likely just diseased artery/diffuse plaquing.  I decided to cover this segment using a second 4.0 x 15 mm, excised, and two stents were overlapped, the overlap was postdilated using the same stent delivery balloon at high pressure with excellent angiographic result.,Left ventricular catheterization was performed with #6-French angle pigtail catheter.  The left ventricle is rather smaller in size.  The mid inferior wall is minimally hypokinetic, ejection fraction is 70%.  There is no evidence of aortic wall stenosis or mitral regurgitation.,Femoral angiography revealed that the entry point was above the bifurcation of the right common femoral artery and I have performed this as Perclose hemostasis.,CONCLUSIONS,1.  Normal left ventricular size and function.  Ejection fraction is 65% to 70%.  No MR.,2.  Successful angioplasty and stenting of the subtotally closed mid RCA.  This was hard, organized thrombus, very difficult to penetrate.  I have deployed two overlapping 4.0 x15 mm excised and with excellent angiographic result.  The RCA is dominant.,3.  No moderate disease in the distal left main.  Moderate disease in the ostium of the left circumflex artery.  Mild disease in the proximal LAD.,PLAN: , Recommend smoking cessation.

The appendix was normal appearing.  The bowel and omentum were normal appearing.  There was no evidence of endometriosis.  Peritoneal surfaces and vesicouterine peritoneum as well as appendix and cul-de-sac were all free of any evidence of endometriosis.,PROCEDURE:,  After informed consent was obtained and all questions were answered to the patient's satisfaction in layman's terms, she was taken to the Operating Room where first a spinal anesthesia with Astramorph was obtained without any difficulty.  She then underwent a general anesthesia with endotracheal tube also without any difficulty.  She was then examined under anesthesia with noted findings as above.  The patient was then placed in dorsal supine position and prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion..  A vertical skin incision was made 1 cm below the umbilicus extending down to 2 cm above the pubic symphysis.  This was made with a first knife and then carried down to the underlying layer of the fascia with the second knife.  Fascia was excised in the midline and extended superiorly and inferiorly with the Mayo scissors.  The rectus muscle was then separated in the midline.  The peritoneum identified and entered bluntly.  The peritoneal incision was then extended superiorly and inferiorly with external visualization of the bladder.  The uterus was markedly evident upon entering the peritoneal cavity.  The uterus was then exteriorized and noted to have the findings as above.  At this point, approximately 10 cc of vasopressin 20 units and 30 cc was injected into the uterine fundus and multiple fibroids were removed by using the incision with the Bovie and then using a blunt and the sharp dissection and grasping with Lahey clamps.  Once the debulking of the uterus was felt appropriate to proceed with the hysterectomy, the uterus was then reapproximated with a few #0 Vicryl sutures in a figure-of-eight fashion.  The round ligaments were identified bilaterally and clamped with the hemostats and transacted with the Metzenbaum scissors.  The round ligaments were then bilaterally tied with the #0 tie and noted to be hemostatic.  The uterovarian vessels bilaterally were then isolated through a vascular window created from taking down the round ligaments.  The uterovarian vessels bilaterally were #0 tied and then doubly clamped with straight Ochsner clamps and transacted and suture tied with a Heaney hand stitch fashion, and both uterine and ovarian vessels were noted to be hemostatic.  At this time, the attention was then turned to the vesicouterine peritoneum, which was tented up with Allis clamps and the bladder flap was then created sharply with Russian pickups and the Metzenbaum scissors.  Then the bladder was bluntly dissected off the underlying cervix with a moist Ray-Tec sponge down to the level of the cervix.,At this point, the uterus was pulled on traction and the uterosacral ligaments were easily visualized.  Using #2-0 PDS suture, the suture was placed through both uterosacral ligaments distally with a backhand stitch fashion throwing the sutures from lateral to medial.  These sutures were then tagged and saved for later.  The uterine vessels were then identified bilaterally and skeletonized, then clamped with straight Ochsner clamps balancing off the cervix, and the uterine vessels were then transacted and suture ligated with #0 Vicryl and noted to be hemostatic.  In a similar fashion, the broad ligament down to the level of the cardinal ligaments was clamped with curved Ochsner and transacted and suture ligated and noted to be hemostatic.  At this point, the Lahey clamp was placed on the cervix and the cervix was tented up.  The pubocervical vesical fascia was transacted with long knife.  Then while protecting posteriorly, using the double-pointed scissors, the vagina was entered with double-pointed scissors at the level of the cervix and was grasped with a straight Ochsner clamp.  The uterus and cervix were then amputated using the Jorgenson scissors and the cuff was outlined with Ochsner clamps.  The cuff was then copiously painted with Betadine soaked sponge.  The Betadine-soaked sponge was placed in the patient's vagina.  Then the cuff was then closed with a #0 Vicryl in a running locked fashion to make sure to bring the ipsilateral cardinal ligaments into the vaginal cuff.  This was accomplished with one #0 Vicryl running stitch and then an Allis clamp was placed in the midsection portion of the cuff and tented up and a #0 Vicryl figure-of-eight was placed in the midsection portion of the cuff.  At this time, the uterosacral ligaments previously tagged needle was brought through the cardinal ligament and the uterosacral ligament on the ipsilateral side.  The needle was cut off and these were then tagged with the hemostats.  The cuff was then closed by taking the running suture and bringing back through the posterior peritoneum, grabbing part of the uterosacral and midsection portion of the posterior peritoneum of the uterosacral and then tying the cuff down to bunch and cuff together.  The suture in the midportion of the cuff was then used to tie down the round ligaments bilaterally to the cuff.  The abdomen was copiously irrigated with warm normal saline.  All areas were noted to be hemostatic.  Then the previously tagged uterosacral sutures were then tied bringing the vaginal cuff angles down to the uterosacral ligaments.  The abdomen was then once again copiously irrigated with warm normal saline.  All areas were noted to be hemostatic.  The sigmoid colon was replaced back into the hollow of the sacrum.  Then the omentum was pulled over the bowel.  After the myomectomy was performed, the GYN Balfour was placed into the patient's abdomen and the bowel was packed away with moist laparotomy sponges.  The GYN Balfour was then removed.  Packing sponges were removed and the fascia was then closed in an interrupted figure-of-eight fashion with #0 Vicryl.,Skin was closed with staples.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  The sponge, lap, and needle counts were correct x2.  The sponge from the patient's vagina was removed and the vagina was noted to be hemostatic.  The patient would be followed throughout her hospital stay.\",\n",

The patient was elected to have a left modified radical mastectomy, she was not interested in a partial mastectomy.  She is aware of the risks and complications of surgery, and wished to proceed.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was taken to the operating room.  She underwent general endotracheal anesthetic.  The TED stockings and venous compression devices were placed on both lower extremities and they were functioning well.  The patient's left anterior chest wall, neck, axilla, and left arm were prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.  The recent biopsy site was located in the upper and outer quadrant of left breast.  The plain incision was marked along the skin.  Tissues and the flaps were injected with 0.25% Marcaine with epinephrine solution and then a transverse elliptical incision was made in the breast of the skin to include nipple areolar complex as well as the recent biopsy site.  The flaps were raised superiorly and just below the clavicle medially to the sternum, laterally towards the latissimus dorsi, rectus abdominus fascia.  Following this, the breast tissue along with the pectoralis major fascia were dissected off the pectoralis major muscle.  The dissection was started medially and extended laterally towards the left axilla.  The breast was removed and then the axillary contents were dissected out.  Left axillary vein and artery were identified and preserved as well as the lung _____.  The patient had several clinically palpable lymph nodes, they were removed with the axillary dissection.  Care was taken to avoid injury to any of the above mentioned neurovascular structures.  After the tissues were irrigated, we made sure there were no signs of bleeding.  Hemostasis had been achieved with Hemoclips.  Hemovac drains x2 were then brought in and placed under the left axilla as well as in the superior and inferior breast flaps.  The subcu was then approximated with interrupted 4-0 Vicryl sutures and skin with clips.  The drains were sutured to the chest wall with 3-0 nylon sutures.

After adequate sedation was achieved by the anesthesia team, the above-mentioned anesthetic mixture was infiltrated directly into the patient's left foot to anesthetize the future surgical sites.  The left ankle was covered with cast padding and an 18-inch ankle tourniquet was placed around the left ankle and set at 250 mmHg.  The left foot was then prepped, scrubbed, and draped in a normal sterile technique.  The left ankle tourniquet was inflated.  Attention was then directed on the dorsolateral aspect of the fifth left metatarsophalangeal joint where a 4-cm linear incision was placed over the fifth left metatarsophalangeal joint parallel and lateral to the course of the extensor digitorum longus to the fifth left toe.  The incision was deepened through the subcutaneous tissues.  All the bleeders were identified, cut, clamped, and cauterized.  The incision was deepened to the level of the capsule and the periosteum of the fifth left metatarsophalangeal joint.  All the tendinous and neurovascular structures were identified and retracted from the site to be preserved.  Using sharp and dull dissection, the soft tissue attachments through the fifth left metatarsal head were mobilized.  The lateral and plantar aspect of the fifth left metatarsal head were adequately exposed and using the sagittal saw a lateral and plantar condylectomy of the fifth left metatarsal head were then achieved.  The bony prominences were removed and passed off the operating table to be sent to pathology for identification.  The remaining sharp edges of the fifth left metatarsal head were then smoothened with the use of a dental rasp.  The area was copiously flushed with saline.  Then, 3-0 Vicryl and 4-0 Vicryl suture materials were used to approximate the periosteal, capsular, and subcutaneous tissues respectively.  The incision was reinforced with Steri-Strips.  Range of motion of the fifth left metatarsophalangeal joint was tested and was found to be excellent and uninhibited.  The patient's left ankle tourniquet at this time was deflated.  Immediate hyperemia was noted to the entire left lower extremity upon deflation of the cuff.  The patient's incision was covered with Xeroform, copious amounts of fluff and Kling, stockinette, and Ace bandage and the patient's left foot was placed in a surgical shoe.  The patient was then transferred to the recovery room under the care of the anesthesia team with her vital signs stable and her vascular status at appropriate levels.

It was accompanied by diaphoresis and shortness of breath.  The patient was felt to be a candidate for mitral valve repair versus mitral valve replacement and underwent a stress test as part of his evaluation for chest pain.  He underwent adenosine Cardiolite, which revealed 2 mm ST segment depression in leads II, III aVF, and V3, V4, and V5.  Stress images revealed left ventricular dilatations suggestive of multivessel disease.  He is undergoing evaluation today as a part of preoperative evaluation and because of the positive stress test.,PROCEDURE: , After risks, benefits, alternatives of the above mentioned procedure were explained to the patient in detail, informed consent was obtained both verbally and writing.  The patient was taken to the Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory where the procedure was performed.  The right inguinal area was sterilely cleansed with a Betadine solution and the patient was draped in the usual manner.  1% lidocaine solution was used to anesthetize the right inguinal area.  Once adequate anesthesia had been obtained, a thin-walled Argon needle was used to cannulate the right femoral artery.,The guidewire was then advanced through the lumen of the needle without resistance and a small nick was made in the skin.  The needle was removed and a pressure was held.  A #6 French arterial sheath was advanced over the guidewire without resistance.  The dilator and guidewire were removed and the sheath was flushed.  A Judkins left #4 catheter was advanced to the ascending aorta under direct fluoroscopic visualization with the use of the guidewire.  The guidewire was removed and the catheter was connected to the manifold and flushed.  The ostium of the left main coronary artery was carefully engaged and limited evaluation was performed after noticing that the patient had a significant left main coronary artery stenosis.  The catheter was withdrawn from the ostium of the left main coronary artery and the guidewire was inserted through the tip of the catheter.  The catheter was removed over guidewire and a Judkins right #4 catheter was advanced to the ascending aorta under direct fluoroscopic visualization with use of a guidewire.

The patient was sedated, and an adequate local anesthetic was administered using 1% lidocaine without epinephrine.  The patient was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.,A standard curvilinear umbilical incision was made, and dissection was carried down to the hernia sac using a combination of Metzenbaum scissors and Bovie electrocautery.  The sac was cleared of overlying adherent tissue, and the fascial defect was delineated.  The fascia was cleared of any adherent tissue for a distance of 1.5 cm from the defect.  The sac was then placed into the abdominal cavity and the defect was closed primarily using simple interrupted 0 Vicryl sutures.  The umbilicus was then re-formed using 4-0 Vicryl to tack the umbilical skin to the fascia.,The wound was then irrigated using sterile saline, and hemostasis was obtained using Bovie electrocautery.  The skin was approximated with 4-0 Vicryl in a subcuticular fashion.  The skin was prepped with benzoin, and Steri-Strips were applied.  A dressing was then applied.

Adequate general endotracheal anesthesia was induced.  Appropriate monitoring lines were placed.  The right neck, chest and left arm were prepped and draped in a sterile fashion.  A small incision was made at the top of the anterior jugular triangle in the right neck.  Through this small incision, the right internal jugular vein was punctured and a guidewire was placed.  It was punctured a 2nd time, and a 2nd guidewire was placed.  The Tessio catheters were assembled.  They were measured for length.  Counter-incisions were made on the right chest.  They were then tunneled through these lateral chest wall incisions to the neck incision, burying the Dacron cuffs.  They were flushed with saline.  A suture was placed through the guidewire, and the guidewire and dilator were removed.  The arterial catheter was then placed through this, and the tear-away introducer was removed.  The catheter aspirated and bled easily.  It was flushed with saline and capped.  This was repeated with the venous line.  It also aspirated easily and was flushed with saline and capped.  The neck incision was closed with a 4-0 Tycron, and the catheters were sutured at the exit sites with 4-0 nylon.  Dressings were applied.  An incision was then made at the left wrist.  The basilic vein was dissected free, as was the radial artery.  Heparin was given, 50 mg.  The radial artery was clamped proximally and distally with a bulldog.  It was opened with a #11 blade and Potts scissors, and stay sutures of 5-0 Prolene were placed.  The vein was clipped distally, divided and spatulated for anastomosis.  It was sutured to the radial artery with a running 7-0 Prolene suture.  The clamps were removed.  Good flow was noted through the artery.  Protamine was given, and the wound was closed with interrupted 3-0 Dexon subcutaneous and a running 4-0 Dexon subcuticular on the skin.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.',\n",

The patient had a chest x-ray and based on that there is concern by the Radiology it could be a foreign body in the right main stem.  The patient has been taken to the operating room for rigid bronchoscopy and foreign body removal.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was taken to the operating room, placed supine, put under general mask anesthesia.  Using a 3.5 rigid bronchoscope we visualized between the cords into the trachea.  There were some secretions but that looked okay.  Got down at the level of the carina to see a foreign body flapping in the right main stem.  I then used graspers to grasp to try to pull into the scope itself.  I could not do that, I thus had to pull the scope out along with the foreign body that was held on to with a grasper.  It appeared to be consisting of some type of plastic piece that had broke off some different object.  I took the scope and put it back down into the airway again.  Again, there was secretion in the trachea that we suctioned out.  We looked down into the right bronchus intermedius.  There was no other pathology noted, just some irritation in the right main stem area.  I looked down the left main stem as well and that looked okay as well.  I then withdrew the scope.  Trachea looked fine as well as the cords.  I put the patient back on mask oxygen to wake the patient up.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.',\n",

Right thoracotomy.,ANESTHESIA:  ,General endotracheal anesthesia with a dual-lumen tube.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , After obtaining informed consent from the patient, including a thorough explanation of the risks and benefits of the aforementioned procedure, the patient was taken to the operating room and general endotracheal anesthesia was administered.  Prior to administration of general anesthesia, the patient had an epidural anesthesia placed.  In addition, he had a dual-lumen endotracheal tube placed.  The patient was placed in the supine position to begin the procedure.  His abdomen and chest were prepped and draped in the standard surgical fashion.  After applying sterile dressings, a #10-blade scalpel was used to make an upper midline incision from the level of the xiphoid to just below the umbilicus.  Dissection was carried down through the linea using Bovie electrocautery.  The abdomen was opened.  Next, a Balfour retractor was positioned as well as a mechanical retractor.  Next, our attention was turned to freeing up the stomach.  In an attempt to do so, we identified the right gastroepiploic artery and arcade.  We incised the omentum and retracted it off the stomach and gastroepiploic arcade.  The omentum was divided using suture ligature with 2-0 silk.  We did this along the greater curvature and then moved to the lesser curvature where the short gastric arteries were taken down with ligation using 2-0 silk.  Next, we turned our attention to performing a Kocher maneuver.  This was done and the stomach was freed up.  We took down the falciform ligament as well as the caudate attachment to the diaphragm.  We enlarged the diaphragmatic hiatus so as to be able to place approximately 3 fingers into the chest.  We also did a portion of the esophageal dissection from the abdomen into the chest area.  The esophagus and the esophageal hiatus were identified in the abdomen.  We next turned our attention to the left gastric artery.  The left gastric artery was identified at the base of the stomach.  We first took the left gastric vein by ligating and dividing it using 0 silk ties.  The left gastric artery was next taken using suture ligature with silk ties followed by 2-0 stick tie reinforcement.  At this point the stomach was freely mobile.  We then turned our attention to performing our jejunostomy feeding tube.  A 2-0 Vicryl pursestring was placed in the jejunum approximately 20 cm distal to the ligament of Treitz.  We then used Bovie electrocautery to open the jejunum at this site.  We placed a 16-French red rubber catheter through this site.  We tied down in place.  We then used 3-0 silk sutures to perform a Witzel.  Next, the loop of jejunum was tacked up to the abdominal wall using 2-0 silk ties.  After doing so and pulling the feeding jejunostomy out through the skin and securing it appropriately, we turned our attention to closing the abdomen.  This was done with #1 Prolene.  We put in a 2nd layer of 2-0 Vicryl.  The skin was closed with 4-0 Monocryl.,Next, we turned our attention to performing the thoracic portion of the procedure.  The patient was placed in the left lateral decubitus position.  The right chest was prepped and draped appropriately.  We then used a #10 blade scalpel to make an incision in a posterolateral, non-muscle-sparing fashion.  Dissection was carried down to the level of the ribs with Bovie electrocautery.  Next, the ribs were counted and the 5th interspace was entered.  The lung was deflated.  We placed standard chest retractors.  Next, we incised the peritoneum over the esophagus.  We dissected the esophagus to just above the azygos vein.  The azygos vein, in fact, was taken with 0 silk ligatures and reinforced with 2-0 stick ties.  As mentioned, we dissected the esophagus both proximally and distally down to the level of the hiatus.  After doing this, we backed our NG tube out to above the level where we planned to perform our pursestring.  We used an automatic pursestring and applied.  We then transected the proximal portion of the stomach with Metzenbaum scissors.  We secured our pursestring and then placed a 28 anvil in the divided proximal portion of the esophagus.  The pursestring was then tied down without difficulty.  Next, we tabularized our stomach using a #80 GIA stapler.  After doing so, we chose a portion of the stomach more distally and opened it using Bovie electrocautery.  We placed our EEA stapler through it and then punched out through the gastric wall.  We connected our anvil to the EEA stapler.  This was then secured appropriately.  We checked to make sure that there was appropriate muscle apposition.  We then fired the stapler.  We obtained 2 complete rings, 1 of the esophagus and 1 of the stomach, which were sent for pathology.  We also sent the gastroesophageal specimen for pathology.  Of note was the fact that the frozen section showed no evidence of tumor and in the proximal distal margins.  We then turned our attention to closing the gastrostomy opening.  This was closed with 2-0 Vicryl in a running fashion.  We then buttressed this with serosal 3-0 Vicryl interrupted sutures.  We returned the newly constructed gastroesophageal anastomosis into the chest and covered it by covering the pleura over it.  Next, we placed two #28-French chest tubes, 1 anteriorly and 1 posteriorly, taking care not to place it near the anastomosis.  We then closed the chest with #2 Vicryl in an interrupted figure-of-eight fashion.  The lung was brought up.  We closed the muscle layers with #0 Vicryl followed by #0 Vicryl; then we closed the subcutaneous layer with 2-0 Vicryl and the skin with 4-0 Monocryl.  Sterile dressing was applied.  The instrument and sponge count was correct at the end of the case.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and was extubated in the operating room and transferred to the ICU in good condition.',\n",

A transverse incision was made in the wrist, between FCR and FCU, one fingerbreadth proximal to the interval between the glabrous skin of the palm and normal forearm skin.  Blunt dissection exposed the antebrachial fascia.  Hemostasis was obtained with bipolar cautery.  A distal-based window in the antebrachial fascia was then fashioned.  Care was taken to protect the underlying contents.  A proximal forearm fasciotomy was performed under direct vision.  A synovial elevator was used to palpate the undersurface of the transverse carpal ligament, and synovium was elevated off this undersurface.  Hamate sounds were then used to palpate the hook of hamate.  The endoscopic instrument was then inserted into the proximal incision.  The transverse carpal ligament was easily visualized through the portal.  Using palmar pressure, the transverse carpal ligament was held against the portal as the instrument was inserted down the transverse carpal ligament to the distal end.,The distal end of the transverse carpal ligament was then identified in the window.  The blade was then elevated, and the endoscopic instrument was withdrawn, dividing the transverse carpal ligament under direct vision.  After complete division o the transverse carpal ligament, the instrument was reinserted.  Radial and ulnar edges of the transverse carpal ligament were identified, and complete release was confirmed.,The wound was then closed with running subcuticular stitch.

I asked him to discuss each symptom individually as he had a very hard time describing the nature of his problems.  He first mentioned that he has neck pain.  He states that he has had this for at least 15 years.  It is worse with movement.  It has progressed very slowly over the course of 15 years.  It is localized to the base of his neck and is sharp in quality.  He also endorses a history of gait instability.  This has been present for a few years and has been slightly progressively worsening.  He describes that he feels unsteady on his feet and \"walks like a duck.\"  He has fallen about three or four times over the past year and a half.,He also describes that he has numbness in his feet.  When I asked him to describe this in more detail, the numbness is actually restricted to his toes.  Left is slightly more affected than the right.  He denies any tingling or paresthesias.  He also described that he is slowly losing control of his hands.  He thinks that he is dropping objects due to weakness or incoordination in his hands.

Extraocular movements are intact without nystagmus.  Facial sensation is normal.  There is no facial, jaw, palate, or tongue weakness.  Hearing is grossly intact.  Shoulder shrug is full.,Motor:  He has normal muscle bulk and tone.  There is no atrophy.  He has few fasciculations in his calf muscles bilaterally.  Manual muscle testing reveals MRC grade 5/5 strength in all proximal and distal muscles of the upper and lower extremities.  There is no action or percussion myotonia or paramyotonia.,Sensory:  He has absent vibratory sensation at the left toe.  This is diminished at the right toe.  Joint position sense is intact.  There is diminished sensation to light touch and temperature at the feet to the knees bilaterally.  Pinprick is intact.  Romberg is absent.

Spondylosis of C6-C7 causing mild bilateral neuroforamining and left paracentral disc herniation causing borderline cord compression.,Thoracic MRI spine without contrast:  Minor degenerative changes without stenosis.,I do not have the MRI of the lumbar spine available to review.,LABORATORY DATA: , 10/07/08:  Vitamin B1 210 (87-280), vitamin B6 6, ESR 6, AST 25, ALT 17, vitamin B12 905, CPK 226 (0-200), T4 0.85, TSH 3.94, magnesium 1.7, RPR nonreactive, CRP 4, Lyme antibody negative, SPEP abnormal (serum protein electrophoresis), but no paraprotein by manifestation, hemoglobin A1c 6.0, aldolase 3.9 and homocystine 9.0.,ASSESSMENT: , The patient is a 63-year-old gentleman with multiple neurologic and nonneurologic symptoms including numbness, gait instability, decreased dexterity of his arms and general fatigue.  His neurological examination is notable for sensory loss in a length-dependent fashion in his feet and legs with scant fasciculations in his calves.  He has fairly normal or very mild increased reflexes including notably the presence of normal ankle jerks.,I think that the etiology of his symptoms is multifactorial.  He probably does have a mild peripheral neuropathy, but the sparing of ankle jerks suggested either the neuropathy is mild or that there is a superimposed myelopathic process such as a cervical or lumbosacral myelopathy.  He really is most concerned about the fatigue and I think it is possible due to suboptimally treated depression and suboptimally treated sleep apnea.  Whether he has another underlying muscular disorder such as a primary myopathy remains to be seen.,RECOMMENDATIONS:,1.  I scheduled him for repeat EMG and nerve conduction studies to evaluate for evidence of neuropathy or myopathy.,2.  I will review his films at our spine conference tomorrow although I am confident in Dr. Z\\'s opinion that there is no surgical indication.,3.  I gave him a prescription for physical therapy to help with gait imbalance training as well as treatment for his neck pain.,4.  I believe that he needs to undergo psychotherapy for his depression.  It may also be worthwhile to adjust his medications, but I will defer to his primary care physician for managing this or for referring him to a therapist.  The patient is very open about proceeding with this suggestion.,5.  He does need to have his sleep apnea better controlled.  He states that he is not compliant because the face mask that he uses does not fit him well.  This should also be addressed.',\n",
       " 'PROCEDURE: , Fiberoptic bronchoscopy.,PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Right lung atelectasis.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Extensive mucus plugging in right main stem bronchus.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:,  Fiberoptic bronchoscopy was carried out at the bedside in the medical ICU after Versed 0.5 mg intravenously given in 2 aliquots.  The patient was breathing supplemental nasal and mask oxygen throughout the procedure.  Saturations and vital signs remained stable throughout.  A flexible fiberoptic bronchoscope was passed through the right naris.  The vocal cords were visualized.  Secretions in the larynx were as aspirated.  As before, he had a mucocele at the right anterior commissure that did not obstruct the glottic opening.  The ports were anesthetized and the trachea entered.  There was no cough reflex helping explain the propensity to aspiration and mucus plugging.  Tracheal secretions were aspirated.  The main carinae were sharp.  However, there were thick, sticky, grey secretions filling the right mainstem bronchus up to the level of the carina.  This was gradually lavaged clear.  Saline and Mucomyst solution were used to help dislodge remaining plugs.  The airways appeared slightly friable, but were patent after the airways were suctioned.  O2 saturations remained in the mid-to-high 90s.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  Specimens were submitted for microbiologic examination.  Despite his frail status, he tolerated bronchoscopy quite well.',\n",

       " 'REASON FOR REFERRAL:,  Chest pain, possible syncopal spells.,She is a very pleasant 31-year-old mother of two children with ADD.,She was doing okay until January of 2009 when she had a partial hysterectomy.  Since then she just says \"things have changed\".  She just does not want to go out anymore and just does not feel the same.  Also, at the same time, she is having a lot of household stressors with both of her children having ADD and ODD and she feels she does not get enough support from her husband.  Her 11-year-old is having a lot of trouble at school and she often has to go there to take care of problems.,In this setting, she has been having multiple cardiovascular complaints including chest pains, which feel \"like cramps\" and sometimes like a dull ache, which will last all day long.  She is also tender in the left breast area and gets numbness in her left hand.  She has also had three spells of \"falling\", she is not really clear on whether these are syncopal, but they sound like they could be as she sees spots before her eyes.  Twice it happened, when getting up quickly at night and another time in the grocery store.  She suffered no trauma.  She has no remote history of syncope.  Her weight has not changed in the past year.,MEDICATIONS: , Naprosyn, which she takes up to six a day.,ALLERGIES:,  Sulfa.,SOCIAL HISTORY: , She does not smoke or drink.

Extremities:  No edema and good distal pulses.,EKG: , Normal sinus rhythm, normal EKG.,ECHOCARDIOGRAM (FOR SYNCOPE): , Essentially normal study.,IMPRESSION:,1.  Syncopal spells - These do sound, in fact, to be syncopal.  I suspect it is simple orthostasis/vasovagal, as her EKG and echocardiogram looks good.  I have asked her to drink plenty of fluids and to not to get up suddenly at night.  I think this should take care of the problem.  I would not recommend further workup unless these spells continue, at which time I would recommend a tilt-table study.,2.  Chest pains - Atypical for cardiac etiology, undoubtedly due to musculoskeletal factors from her emotional stressors.  The Naprosyn is not helping that much, I gave her a prescription for Flexeril and instructed her in its use (not to drive after taking it).,RECOMMENDATIONS:,1.  Reassurance that her cardiac checkup looks excellent, which it does.,2.  Drink plenty of fluids and arise slowly from bed.,3.  Flexeril 10 mg q 6 p.r.n.,4.

The peak workload was 7 METs.  The resting heart rate was 61 beats per minute and the peak heart rate was 173 beats per minute, which was 85% of the age-predicted maximum heart rate response.  The blood pressure response was normal with the resting blood pressure 126/86, and the peak blood pressure of 134/90.  EKG at rest showed normal sinus rhythm with a right-bundle branch block.  The peak stress EKG was abnormal with 2 mm of ST segment depression in V3 to V6, which remained abnormal till about 6 to 8 minutes into recovery.  There were occasional PVCs, but no sustained arrhythmia.  The patient had an episode of supraventricular tachycardia at peak stress.  The ischemic threshold was at a heart rate of 118 beats per minute and at 4.6 METs.  At peak stress, the patient was injected with 30.3 mCi of Cardiolite technetium-99 m sestamibi and myocardial perfusion imaging was obtained, and was compared to resting images.,MYOCARDIAL PERFUSION IMAGING:,1.  The overall quality of the scan was fair in view of increased abdominal uptake, increased bowel uptake seen.,2.  There was a large area of moderate to reduced tracer concentration seen in the inferior wall and the inferior apex.  This appeared to be partially reversible in the resting images.,3.  The left ventricle appeared normal in size.,4.  Gated SPECT images revealed normal wall motion and normal left ventricular systolic function with normal wall thickening.  The calculated ejection fraction was 70% at rest.,CONCLUSIONS:,1.  Average exercise tolerance.,2.  Adequate cardiac stress.,3.  Abnormal EKG response to stress, consistent with ischemia.  No symptoms of chest pain at rest.,4.  Myocardial perfusion imaging was abnormal with a large-sized, moderate intensity partially reversible inferior wall and inferior apical defect, consistent with inferior wall ischemia and inferior apical ischemia.,5.

She is a 68-year-old woman, who is very fearful of the aforementioned procedures.  Risks and benefits of the procedure were explained to her to include bleeding, infection, arterial trauma requiring surgery, access issues and recurrence.  She appears to understand and agrees to proceed.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: , The patient was taken to the Angio Suite, placed in a supine position.  After adequate conscious sedation, both groins were prepped with Chloraseptic prep.  Cloth towels and paper drapes were placed.  Local anesthesia was administered in the common femoral artery and using ultrasound guidance, the common femoral artery was accessed.  Guidewire was threaded followed by a ,4-French sheath.  Through the 4-French sheath a 4-French Omni flush catheter was placed.  The glidewire was removed and contrast administered to identify the level of the renal artery.  Using power injector an aortogram proceeded.,The catheter was then pulled down to the aortic bifurcation.  A timed run-off view of both legs was performed and due to a very abnormal and delayed run-off in the left, I opted to perform an angiogram of the left lower extremity with an isolated approach.  The catheter was pulled down to the aortic bifurcation and using a glidewire, I obtained access to the contralateral left external iliac artery.  The Omni flush catheter was advanced to the left distal external iliac artery.  The glidewire rather exchanged for an Amplatz stiff wire.  This was left in place and the 4-French sheath removed and replaced with a 6-French destination 45-cm sheath.  This was advanced into the proximal superficial femoral artery and an angiogram performed.  I identified a functionally occluded distal superficial femoral artery and after obtaining views of the run off made plans for angioplasty.,The patient was given 5000 units of heparin and this was allowed to circulate.  A glidewire was carefully advanced using Roadmapping techniques through the functionally occluded blood vessels.  A 4-mm x 4-cm angioplasty balloon was used to dilate the area in question.,Final views after dilatation revealed a dissection.  A search for a 5-mm stent was performed, but none of this was available.  For this reason, I used a 6-mm x 80-mm marked stent and placed this at the distal superficial femoral artery.  Post dilatation was performed with a 4-mm angioplasty balloon.  Further views of the left lower extremity showed irregular change in the popliteal artery.  No significant stenosis could be identified in the left popliteal artery and noninvasive scan.  For this reason, I chose not to treat any further areas in the left leg.,I then performed closure of the right femoral artery with a 6-French Angio-Seal device.  Attention was turned to the left femoral artery and local anesthesia administered.  Access was obtained with the ultrasound and the femoral artery identified.  Guidewire was threaded followed by a 4-French sheath.  This was immediately exchanged for the 6-French destination sheath after the glidewire was used to access the distal external iliac artery.  The glidewire was exchanged for the Amplatz stiff wire to place the destination sheath.  The destination was placed in the proximal superficial femoral artery and angiogram obtained.  Initial views had been obtained from the right femoral sheath before removal.,Views of the right superficial femoral artery demonstrated significant stenosis with accelerated velocities in the popliteal and superficial femoral artery.  For this reason, I performed the angioplasty of the superficial femoral artery using the 4-mm balloon.  A minimal dissection plane measuring less than 1 cm was identified at the proximal area of dilatation.  No further significant abnormality was identified.  To avoid placing a stent in the small vessel I left it alone and approached the popliteal artery.  A 3-mm balloon was chosen to dilate a 50 to 79% popliteal artery stenosis.  Reasonable use were obtained and possibly a 4-mm balloon could have been used.  However, due to her propensity for dissection I opted not to.  I then exchanged the glidewire for an O1 for Thruway guidewire using an exchange length.  This was placed into the left posterior tibial artery.  A 2-mm balloon was used to dilate the orifice of the posterior tibial artery.  I then moved the wire to the perineal artery and dilated the proximal aspect of this vessel.  Final images showed improved run-off to the right calf.  The destination sheath was pulled back into the left external iliac artery and an Angio-Seal deployed.,FINDINGS: , Aortogram demonstrates a dual right renal artery with the inferior renal artery supplying the lower one third of the right renal parenchyma.  No evidence of renal artery stenosis is noted bilaterally.  There is a single left renal artery.  The infrarenal aorta, both common iliac and the external iliac arteries are normal.  On the right, a superficial femoral artery is widely patent and normal proximally.  At the distal third of the thigh there is diffuse disease with moderate stenosis noted.  Moderate stenosis is also noted in the popliteal artery and single vessel run-off through the posterior tibial artery is noted.  The perineal artery is functionally occluded at the midcalf.  The dorsal pedal artery filled by collateral at the high ankle level.,On the left, the proximal superficial femoral artery is patent.  Again, at the distal third of the thigh, there is a functional occlusion of the superficial femoral artery with poor collateralization to the high popliteal artery.  This was successfully treated with angioplasty and a stent placement.  The popliteal artery is diffusely diseased without focal stenosis.  The tibioperoneal trunk is patent and the anterior tibial artery occluded at its orifice.,IMPRESSION,1.  Normal bilateral renal arteries with a small accessory right renal artery.,2.  Normal infrarenal aorta as well as normal bilateral common and external iliac arteries.,3.  The proximal right renal artery is normal with moderately severe stenosis in the superficial femoral popliteal and tibial arteries.  Successful angioplasty with reasonable results in the distal superficial femoral, popliteal and proximal posterior tibial artery as described.,4.  Normal proximal left superficial femoral artery with functional occlusion of the distal left superficial femoral artery successfully treated with angioplasty and stent placement.  Run-off to the left lower extremity is via a patent perineal and posterior tibial artery.',\n",
       " \"PRE AND POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Left cervical radiculopathy at C5, C6,OPERATION: , Left C5-6 hemilaminotomy and foraminotomy with medial facetectomy for microscopic decompression of nerve root.,After informed consent was obtained from the patient, he was taken to the OR.  After general anesthesia had been induced, Ted hose stockings and pneumatic compression stockings were placed on the patient and a Foley catheter was also inserted.  At this point, the patient's was placed in three point fixation with a Mayfield head holder and then the patient was placed on the operating table in a prone position.  The patient's posterior cervical area was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  At this time the patient's incision site was infiltrated with 1 percent Lidocaine with epinephrine.  A scalpel was used to make an approximate 3 cm skin incision cephalad to the prominent C7 spinous processes, which could be palpated.  After dissection down to a spinous process using Bovie cautery, a clamp was placed on this spinous processes and cross table lateral x-ray was taken.  This showed the spinous process to be at the C4 level.  Therefore, further soft tissue dissection was carried out caudally to this level after the next spinous processes presumed to be C5 was identified.  After the muscle was dissected off the lamina laterally on the left side, self retaining retractors were placed and after hemostasis was achieved, a Penfield probe was placed in the interspace presumed to be C5-6 and another cross table lateral x-ray of the C spine was taken.  This film confirmed our position at C5-6 and therefore the operating microscope was brought onto the field at this time.  At the time the Kerrison rongeur was used to perform a hemilaminotomy by starting with the inferior margin of the superior lamina.  The superior margin of the inferior lamina of C6 was also taken with the Kerrison rongeur after the ligaments had been freed by using a Woodson probe.  This was then extended laterally to perform a medial facetectomy also using the Kerrison rongeur.  However, progress was limited because of thickness of the bone.  Therefore at this time the Midas-Rex drill, the AM8 bit was brought onto the field and this was used to thin out the bone around our laminotomy and medial facetectomy area.  After the bone had been thinned out, further bone was removed using the Kerrison rongeur.  At this point the nerve root was visually inspected and observed to be decompressed.  However, there was a layer of fibrous tissue overlying the exiting nerve root which was removed by placing a Woodson resector in a plane between the fibrous sheath and the nerve root and incising it with a 15 blade.  Hemostasis was then achieved by using Gelfoam as well as bipolar electrocautery.  After hemostasis was achieved, the surgical site was copiously irrigated with Bacitracin.  Closure was initiated by closing the muscle layer and the fascial layer with 0 Vicryl stitches.  The subcutaneous layer was then reapproximated using 000 Dexon.  The skin was reapproximated using a running 000 nylon.  Sterile dressings were applied.  The patient was then extubated in the OR and transferred to the Recovery room in stable condition.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:,  minimal.\",\n",

Left coronary artery: The left main coronary artery is unremarkable. The left anterior descending has 30 to 40% narrowing with tortuosity in its proximal portion, patent first septal perforator branch. The first diagonal branch is a 2 mm vessel with a 90% ostial stenosis. The second diagonal branch is unremarkable, as are the tiny distal diagonal branches. The intermediate branch is a small, normal vessel. The ostial non-dominant circumflex has some contrast thinning, but no stenosis, normal obtuse marginal branch, and small AV sulcus circumflex branch.,II. Right coronary artery: The right coronary artery is a large, dominant vessel which gives off large posterior descending and posterolateral left ventricular branches. There are luminal irregularities, less than 25%, within the proximal to mid vessel. Some contrast thinning is present in the distal RCA just before the bifurcation into posterior descending and posterolateral branches. A 25%, smooth narrowing at the origin of the posterior descending branch. Posterolateral branch is unremarkable and quite large, with secondary and tertiary branches.,III.

The patient states that the mass has been present for approximately two weeks and has been rapidly growing in size.  The patient also has history of shave biopsy in the past.  The patient does state that he desires surgical excision at this time.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:,  An IV was instituted by the Department of Anesthesia in the preoperative holding area.  The patient was transported from the operating room and placed on the operating room table in the supine position with the safety belt across his lap.  Copious amount of Webril was placed around the left ankle followed by a blood pressure cuff.  After adequate sedation by the Department of Anesthesia, a total of 6 cc mixed with 1% lidocaine plain with 0.5% Marcaine plain was injected in a digital block fashion at the base of the left hallux as well as the left second toe.,The foot was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile orthopedic fashion.  The foot was elevated from the operating table and exsanguinated with an Esmarch bandage.  Care was taken with the exsanguination to perform exsanguination below the level of the digits so as not to rupture the masses.  The foot was lowered to the operating table.  The stockinet was reflected and the foot was cleansed with wet and dry sponge.  A distal Syme's incision was planned over the distal aspect of the left hallux.  The incision was performed with a #10 blade and deepened with #15 down to the level of bone.  The dorsal skin flap was removed and dissected in toto off of the distal phalanx.  There was noted to be in growth of the soft tissue mass into the dorsal cortex with erosion in the dorsal cortex and exposure of cortical bone at the distal phalanx.  The tissue was sent to Pathology where Dr. Green stated that a frozen sample would be of less use for examining for cancer.  Dr. Green did state that he felt that there was an adequate incomplete excision of the soft tissue for specimen.  At this time, a sagittal saw was then used to resect all ends of bone of the distal phalanx.  The area was inspected for any remaining suspicious tissues.  Any suspicious tissue was removed.  The area was then flushed with copious amounts of sterile saline.  The skin was then reapproximated with #4-0 nylon with a combination of simple and vertical mattress sutures.,Attention was then directed to the left second toe.  There was noted to be a dorsolateral mass over the dorsal distal aspect of the left second toe.  A linear incision was made just medial to the tissue mass.  The mass was then dissected from the overlying skin and off of the underlying capsule.  This tissue mass was hard, round, and pearly-gray in appearance.  It does not invade into any other surrounding tissues.  The area was then flushed with copious amounts of sterile saline and the skin was closed with #4-0 nylon.  Dressings consisted of Owen silk soaked in Betadine, 4x4s, Kling, Kerlix, and an Ace wrap.  The pneumatic ankle tourniquet was released and immediate hyperemic flush was noted to all five digits of the left foot.  The patient tolerated the above procedure and anesthesia well without complications.  The patient was transported to PACU with vital signs stable and vascular status intact.  The patient was given postoperative pain prescription for Vicodin and instructed to follow up with Dr. Bonnani in his office as directed.  The patient will be contacted immediately pending the results of pathology.  Cultures obtained in the case were aerobic and anaerobic gram stain, Silver stain, and a CBC.\",\n",
       " \"TITLE OF OPERATION:  ,Total thyroidectomy for goiter.,INDICATION FOR SURGERY:  ,This is a 41-year-old woman who notes that compressive thyroid goiter and symptoms related to such who wishes to undergo surgery.  Risks, benefits, alternatives of the procedures were discussed in great detail with the patient.  Risks include but were not limited to anesthesia, bleeding, infection, injury to nerve, vocal fold paralysis, hoarseness, low calcium, need for calcium supplementation, tumor recurrence, need for additional treatment, need for thyroid medication, cosmetic deformity, and other.  The patient understood all these issues and they wished to proceed.,PREOP DIAGNOSIS: , Multinodular thyroid goiter with compressive symptoms and bilateral dominant thyroid nodules proven to be benign by fine needle aspiration.,POSTOP DIAGNOSIS: , Multinodular thyroid goiter with compressive symptoms and bilateral dominant thyroid nodules proven to be benign by fine needle aspiration.,ANESTHESIA: , General endotracheal.,PROCEDURE DETAIL: , After identifying the patient, the patient was placed supine in a operating room table.  After establishing general anesthesia via oral endotracheal intubation with a 6 Nerve Integrity monitoring system endotracheal tube.  The eyes were then tacked with Tegaderm.  The Nerve Integrity monitoring system, endotracheal tube was confirmed to be working adequately.  Essentially a 7 cm incision was employed in the lower skin crease of the neck.  A 1% lidocaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine were given.  Shoulder roll was applied.  The patient prepped and draped in a sterile fashion.  A 15-blade was used to make the incision.  Subplatysmal flaps were raised to the thyroid notch and sternal respectively.  The strap muscles were separated in the midline.  As we then turned to the left side where the sternohyoid muscle was separated from the sternothyroid muscle there was a very dense and firm thyroid mass on the left side.  The sternothyroid muscle was transected horizontally.  Similar procedure was performed on the right side.,Attention was then turned to identify the trachea in the midline.  Veins in this area and the pretracheal region were ligated with a harmonic scalpel.  Subsequently, attention was turned to dissecting the capsule off of the left thyroid lobe.  Again this was very firm in nature.  The superior thyroid pole was dissected in the superior third artery, vein, and the individual vessels were ligated with a harmonic scalpel.  The inferior and superior parathyroid glands were protected.  Recurrent laryngeal nerve was identified in the tracheoesophageal groove.  This had arborized early as a course underneath the inferior thyroid artery to a very small tiny anterior motor branch.  This was followed superiorly.  The level of cricothyroid membrane upon complete visualization of the entire nerve, Berry's ligament was transected and the nerve protected and then the thyroid gland was dissected over the trachea.  A prominent pyramidal level was also appreciated and dissected as well.,Attention was then turned to the right side.  There was significant amount of thyroid tissue that was very firm.  Multiple nodules were appreciated.  In a similar fashion, the capsule was dissected.  The superior and inferior parathyroid glands protected and preserved.  The superior thyroid artery and vein were individually ligated with the harmonic scalpel and the inferior thyroid artery was then ligated close to the thyroid gland capsule.  Once the recurrent laryngeal nerve was identified again on this side, the nerve had arborized early prior to the coursing underneath the inferior thyroid artery.  The anterior motor branch was then very fine, almost filamentous and stimulated at 0.5 milliamps, completely dissected toward the cricothyroid membrane with complete visualization.  A small amount of tissue was left at the Berry's ligament as the remainder of thyroid level was dissected over the trachea.  The entire thyroid specimen was then removed, marked with a stitch upon the superior pole.  The wound was copiously irrigated, Valsalva maneuver was given, bleeding points controlled.  The parathyroid glands appeared to be viable.  Both the anterior motor branches that were tiny were stimulated at 5 milliamps and confirmed to be working with the Nerve Integrity monitoring system.,Attention was then turned to burying the Surgicel on the wound bed on both sides.  The strap muscles were reapproximated in the midline using a 3-0 Vicryl suture of the sternothyroid horizontal transection and the strap muscles in the midline were then reapproximated.  The 1/8th inch Hemovac drain was placed and secured with a 3-0 nylon.  The incision was then closed with interrupted 3-0 Vicryl and Indermil for the skin.  The patient has a history of keloid formation and approximately 1 cubic centimeter of 40 mg per cubic centimeter Kenalog was injected into the incisional line using a tuberculin syringe and 25-gauge needle.  The patient tolerated the procedure well, was extubated in the operating room table, and sent to postanesthesia care unit in a good condition.  Upon completion of the case, fiberoptic laryngoscopy revealed intact bilateral true vocal fold mobility.\",\n",

Reposition osteotomy with internal screw fixation to correct angulation deformity of proximal phalanx, right foot.,ANESTHESIA:,Local infiltrate with IV sedation.,INDICATION FOR SURGERY: , The patient has had a longstanding history of foot problems.  The foot problem has been progressive in nature and has not been responsive to conservative treatment.  The preoperative discussion with the patient included the alternative treatment options.,The procedure was explained in detail and risk factors such as infection, swelling, scarred tissue; numbness, continued pain, recurrence, and postoperative management were explained in detail.  The patient has been advised, although no guaranty for success could be given, most patients have improved function and less pain.  All questions were thoroughly answered.  The patient requested surgical repair since the problem has reached a point that interferes with her normal daily activities.  The purpose of the surgery is to alleviate the pain and discomfort.,DETAILS OF PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was brought to the operating room and placed in a supine position.  No tourniquet was utilized.  IV sedation was administered and during that time local anesthetic consisting of approximately 10 mL total in a 1:1 mixture of 0.25% Marcaine and 1% lidocaine with epinephrine was locally infiltrated proximal to the operative site.  The lower extremity was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.  Balanced anesthesia was obtained.,PROCEDURE #1: , Distal metaphyseal osteotomy with internal screw fixation with bunionectomy, right foot.  A dorsal curvilinear incision medial to the extensor hallucis longus tendon was made, extending from the distal third of the shaft of the first metatarsal to a point midway on the shaft of the proximal phalanx.  Care was taken to identify and retract the vital structures and when necessary, vessels were ligated via electrocautery.  Sharp and blunt dissection was carried down through the subcutaneous tissue, superficial fascia, and then down to the capsular and periosteal layer, which was visualized.  A linear periosteal capsular incision was made in line with the skin incision.  The capsular tissue and periosteal layer were underscored, free from its underlying osseous attachments, and they refracted to expose the osseous surface.  Inspection revealed increased first intermetatarsal angle and hypertrophic changes to the first metatarsal head.  The head of the first metatarsal was dissected free from its attachment medially and dorsally, delivered dorsally and may be into the wound.,Inspection revealed the first metatarsophalangeal joint surface appeared to be in satisfactory condition.  The sesamoid was in satisfactory condition.  An oscillating saw was utilized to resect the hypertrophic portion of the first metatarsal head to remove the normal and functional configuration.  Care was taken to preserve the sagittal groove.  The rough edges were then smoothed with a rasp.,Attention was then focused on the medial mid portion of the first metatarsal head where a K-wire access guide was positioned to define the apex and direction of displacement for the capital fragment.  The access guide was noted to be in good position.  A horizontally placed, through-and-through osteotomy with the apex distal and the base proximal was completed.  The short plantar arm was from the access guide to proximal plantar and the long dorsal arm was from the access guide to proximal dorsal.  The capital fragment was distracted off the first metatarsal, moved laterally to decrease the intermetatarsal angle to create a more anatomical and functional position of the first metatarsal head.  The capital fragment was impacted upon the metatarsal.,Inspection revealed satisfactory reduction of the intermetatarsal angle and good alignment of the capital fragment.  It was then fixated with 1 screw.  A guide pin was directed from the dorsal aspect of the capital fragment to the plantar aspect of the shaft and first metatarsal in a distal dorsal to proximal plantar direction.  The length was measured, __________ mm cannulated cortical screw was placed over the guide pin and secured in position.  Compression and fixation were noted to be satisfactory.  Inspection revealed good fixation and alignment at the operative site.  Attention was then directed to the medial portion of the distal third of the shaft of the first metatarsal where an oscillating saw was used to resect the small portion of the bone that was created by shifting the capital fragment laterally.  All rough edges were rasped smooth.  Examination revealed there was still lateral deviation of the hallux.  A second procedure, the reposition osteotomy of the proximal phalanx with internal screw fixation to correct angulation deformity was indicated., ,PROCEDURE #2:,  Reposition osteotomy with internal screw fixation to correct angulation deformity, proximal phalanx, right hallux.  The original skin incision was extended from the point just distal to the interphalangeal joint.  All vital structures were identified and retracted.  Sharp and blunt dissection was carried down through the subcutaneous tissue, superficial fascia, and down to the periosteal layer, which was underscored, free from its underlying osseous attachments and reflected to expose the osseous surface.  The focus of the deformity was noted to be more distal on the hallux.  Utilizing an oscillating saw, a more distal, wedge-shaped transverse oblique osteotomy was made with the apex being proximal and lateral and the base medial distal was affected.  The proximal phalanx was then placed in appropriate alignment and stabilized with a guide pin, which was then measured, __________ 14 mm cannulated cortical screw was placed over the guide pin and secured into position.,Inspection revealed good fixation and alignment at the osteotomy site.  The alignment and contour of the first way was now satisfactorily improved.  The entire surgical wound was flushed with copious amounts of sterile normal saline irrigation.  The periosteal and capsular layer was closed with running sutures of #3-0 Vicryl.  The subcutaneous tissue was closed with #4-0 Vicryl and the skin edges coapted well with #4-0 nylon with running simples, reinforced with Steri-Strips.,Approximately 6 mL total in a 1:1 mixture of 0.25% Marcaine and 1% lidocaine plain was locally infiltrated proximal to the operative site for postoperative anesthesia.  A dressing consisting of Adaptic and 4 x 4 was applied to the wound making sure the hallux was carefully splinted, followed by confirming bandages and an ACE wrap to provide mild compression.  The patient tolerated the procedure and anesthesia well and left the operating room to recovery room in good postoperative condition with vital signs stable and arterial perfusion intact as evident by the normal capillary fill time.,A walker boot was dispensed and applied.  The patient should wear it when walking or standing., ,The next office visit will be in 4 days.  The patient was given prescriptions for Percocet 5 mg #40 one p.o. q.4-6h. p.r.n. pain, along with written and oral home instructions.

In a retrograde fashion, the proximal anastomosis was patent.  There was no narrowing within the forearm graft.  Both veins were flushed with heparinized saline and controlled with a vascular clamp.  A longitudinal incision was then created in the upper arm just deep into the subcutaneous tissue fascia.  Utilizing both blunt and sharp dissection, the brachial vein as well as distal anastomosis was isolated.  The distal anastomosis amputated off the fistula and oversewn with continuous running #6-0 Prolene suture tied upon itself.  The vein was controlled with vascular clamps.  Longitudinal venotomy created along the anteromedial wall.  A 7 mm graft was brought on to the field and this was cut to shape and size.  This was sewed to the graft in an end-to-side fashion with U-clips anchoring the graft at the heel and toe with interrupted #6-0 Prolene sutures.  Good backflow bleeding was confirmed.  The vein flushed with heparinized saline and graft was controlled with vascular clamp.  The end of the insertion graft was cut to shape in length and sutured to the graft in an end-to-end fashion with continuous running #6-0 Prolene suture.  Good backflow bleeding was confirmed.  The graftotomy was then closed with interrupted #6-0 Prolene suture.  Flow through the fistula was permitted, a good flow passed.  The wound was copiously irrigated with antibiotic solution.

She states that the methadone did not work for her.  She was \"immune\" to oxycodone.  She had been on tramadol before and was placed back on that.  There was some question that this may have been causing some dizziness.  She also was on clonazepam and alprazolam for the underlying bipolar disorder.,Apparently, her husband was in this afternoon.  He had a box of her pain medications.  It is unclear whether she took a bunch of these or precisely what happened.  I was contacted that she was less responsive.  She periodically has some difficulty to arouse due to pain medications, which she has been requesting repeatedly, though at times does not appear to have objective signs of ongoing pain.  The nurse found her and was unable to arouse her at this point.  There was a concern that she had taken some medications from home.  She was given Narcan and appeared to come around some.  Breathing remained somewhat labored and she had some diffuse scattered rhonchi, which certainly changed from this a.m.  Additional Narcan was given as well as some medications to reverse a possible benzodiazepine toxicity.  With O2 via mask, oxygenation was stable at 90% to 95% after initial hypoxia was noted.  A chest x-ray was obtained at this time.  An ECG was obtained, which shows a sinus tachycardia, noted to have ischemic abnormalities.,In light of the acute decompensation, she was then transferred to the ICU.  We will continue the IV Zosyn.  Respiratory protocol with respiratory management.  Continue alprazolam p.r.n., but avoid if she appears sedated.  We will attempt to avoid additional pain medications, but we will continue with the Dilaudid for time being.

Due to the IUGR as well a decision for a C-section was made.,PROCEDURE: , The patient was taken to the operating room and placed in a seated position with standard spinal form of anesthesia administered by the Anesthesia Department.  The patient was then repositioned, prepped and draped in a slight left lateral tilt.  Once this was completed first knife was used to make a low transverse skin incision approximately two fingerbreadths above the pubic symphysis.  This was extended down to the level of the fascia.  The fascia was nicked in the center and extended in transverse fashion.  Edges of the fascia were grasped with Kocher and both blunt and sharp dissection both caudally and cephalic was completed consistent with the Pfannenstiel technique.  The abdominal rectus muscle was divided in the center, extended in vertical fashion and the peritoneum was entered at a high point and extended in vertical fashion.  Bladder blade was put in place and a bladder flap was created with the use of Metzenbaum and pickups and then bluntly dissected via cautery and reincorporated in the bladder blade.  Second knife was used to make a low transverse uterine incision with care being taken to avoid the presenting part of fetus.  Presenting part was vertex, the head was delivered, followed by the remaining portion of the body.  The mouth and nose were suctioned through bulb syringe and the cord was doubly clamped and cut and then the newborn handed off to waiting nursing personnel.  Cord pH blood and cord blood was obtained.  The placenta was delivered manually and the uterus was externalized and the lining was cleaned off any remaining placental fragments and blood and the incisional edges were reapproximated with 0-chromic and a continuous locking stitch with a second layer used to imbricate the first.  The bladder flap was re-peritonized with Gelfoam underneath and abdomen was irrigated with copious amounts of saline and the uterus was placed back in its anatomical position.  The gutters were wiped clean of any remaining blood and fluid and the edges of the perineum grasped with hemostats and continuous locking stitches of 2-0 Vicryl was used to reapproximate the abdominal rectus muscle as well as the perineum.  This area was then irrigated.  Cautery was used for adequate hemostasis, corners of the fascia grasped with hemostats and continuous locking stitch of 1-Vicryl was started at both corners and overlapped in the center.

She was advised regarding treatment options including radical hysterectomy versus radiation and the former was recommended. ,FINDINGS: , During the examination under anesthesia, the cervix was noted to be healing well from recent cone biopsy and no nodularity was noted in the supporting ligaments.  During the exploratory laparotomy, there was no evidence of disease extension into the broad ligament or bladder flap.  There was no evidence of intraperitoneal spread or lymphadenopathy.  ,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was brought to the Operating Room with an IV in place.  Anesthetic was administered after which she was examined under anesthesia.  The vagina was then prepped and a Foley catheter was placed.  She was prepped and draped.

The Bookwalter retractor was placed, and bowel was packed.  Clamps were placed on the broad ligament for traction.  The retroperitoneum was opened by incising lateral and parallel to the infundibulopelvic ligaments.  The round ligaments were isolated, divided and ligated.  The peritoneum overlying the vesicouterine fold was incised, and the bladder was mobilized using sharp dissection.  The pararectal and paravesical spaces were opened, and the broad ligament was palpated with no evidence of suspicious findings or disease extension.  The utero-ovarian ligaments were then isolated, divided and doubly ligated.  Tubes and ovaries were mobilized.  The ureters were dissected free from the medial leaf of the peritoneum.  When the crossover of the uterine artery was reached, and the artery was isolated at its origin, divided and ligated.  The uterine artery pedicle was dissected anteriorly over the ureter.  The ureter was tunneled through the broad ligament using right angle clamps for tunneling after which each pedicle was divided and ligated.  This was continued until the insertion point of the ureter into the bladder trigone.  The peritoneum across the cul-de-sac was divided, and the rectovaginal space was opened.  Clamps were placed on the uterosacral ligaments at their point of origin.  Tissues were divided and suture ligated.  Clamps were placed on the paravaginal tissues, which were then divided, and suture ligated.  The vagina was then clamped and divided at the junction between the middle and upper third.  The vaginal vault was closed with interrupted figure-of-eight stitches.  Excellent hemostasis was noted.,Retractors were repositioned in the retroperitoneum for the lymphadenectomy.  The borders of dissection included the bifurcation of the common iliac artery superiorly, the crossover of the deep circumflex iliac vein over the external iliac artery inferiorly, the psoas muscle laterally and the anterior division of the hypogastric artery medially.  The obturator nerves were carefully isolated and preserved bilaterally and served as the posterior border of dissection.  Ligaclips were applied where necessary.  After removal of the lymph node specimens, the pelvis was irrigated.  The ovaries were transposed above the pelvic brim using running stitches.  Packs and retractors were removed, and peritoneum was closed with a running stitch.  Subcutaneous tissues were irrigated, and fascia was closed with a running mass stitch using delayed absorbable suture.  Subcutaneous adipose was irrigated, and Scarpa's fascia was closed with a running stitch.  Skin was closed with a running subcuticular stitch.

Nothing was done about it at that time as the patient appeared to not be symptomatic, but he continues to have nausea and vomiting with abdominal pain, but the fact that pneumatosis was found 2 days ago and the patient has survived this long indicates this may be a benign process at the moment, and I would recommend getting a repeat CT scan to assess it further to see if there is worsening of pneumatosis versus resolution to further evaluate the liver lesions and make decisions regarding planning at that time.  The patient has frequent desaturations secondary to his aspiration pneumonia, and any surgical procedure or any surgical intervention would certainly require intubation, which would then necessitate long-term ventilator care as he is not someone who would be able to come off of a ventilator very well in his current state.  So we will look at the CT scan and make decisions based on the findings as far as that is concerned.',\n",

The right lower extremity was protectively padded.  The left leg was propped with multiple blankets.  The hip was then prepped and draped in the usual manner.  A posterior incision was made on the posterolateral aspect of the left hip down to the skin and subcutaneous tissues.  Hemostasis was achieved utilizing electrocautery.  Gluteus fascia was incised in line with a skin incision and the muscle was split posteriorly.  The external rotators were identified after removal of the trochanteric bursa.  Hemostat was utilized to separate the external rotators from the underlying capsule, they were then transected off from their attachment at the posterior intertrochanteric line.  They were then reflected distally.  The capsule was then opened in a T-fashion utilizing the cutting cautery.  Fraction hematoma exuded from the hip joint.  The cork screw was then impacted into the femoral head and it was removed from the acetabulum.  Bone fragments were removed from the neck and acetabulum.  The acetabulum was then inspected and noted to be free from debris.  The proximal femur was then delivered into the wound with the hip internally rotated.,A mortise chisel was then utilized to take the cancellous bone from the proximal femur.  The T-handle broach was then passed down the canal.  The canal was then sequentially broached up to a medium broach.  The calcar was then plained with the hand plainer.  The trial components were positioned into place.  The medium component fit fairly well with the medium 28 mm femoral head.  Once the trial reduction was performed, the hip was taken through range of motion.  There was physiologic crystalling with longitudinal traction.  There was no tendency towards dislocation with flexion of the hip past 90 degrees.  The trial implants were then removed.  The acetabulum was then copiously irrigated with gentamicin solution and suctioned dry.  The medium fenestrated femoral stem was prepared by placing a large segment of bone from the femoral head into the fenestration making it a little larger than the width of the implant to provide a press fit.  The implant was then impacted into place.  The 28 mm femoral head was impacted on the mortise stapler of the femoral stem followed by placement of the 50 mm bipolar cup.  The acetabulum was once again inspected, was free of debris.  The hip was reduced.  It was taken through full range of motion.  There was no tendency for dislocation.  The wound was copiously irrigated with gentamicin solution.  The capsule was then repaired with interrupted #1 Ethibond suture.  External rotators were then reapproximated to the posterior intertrochanteric line utilizing #1 Ethibond in a modified Kessler type stitch.  The wound was once again copiously irrigated with gentamicin solution and suctioned dry.  Gluteus fascia was approximated with interrupted #1 Ethibond.  Subcutaneous layers were approximated with interrupted #2-0 Vicryl and skin approximated with staples.  A bulky dressing was applied to the wound.  The patient was then transferred to the hospital bed, an abductor pillow was positioned into place.  Circulatory status was intact to the extremity at completion of the case.',\n",

The patient suffered a fracture of a distal tibia and fibula as well as her great toe on the left side at that time.  The patient was evaluated by the emergency room and did undergo further evaluation due to loss of consciousness.  She underwent a provisional reduction and splinting in the emergency room followed by further evaluation for her heart and brain by the Medicine Service following this and she was appropriate for surgical intervention.  Due to the comminuted nature of her tibia fracture as well as soft tissue swelling, the patient is in need of a staged surgery with the 1st stage external fixation followed by open treatment and definitive plate and screw fixation.  The patient had swollen lower extremities, however, compartments were soft and she had no sign of compartment syndrome.  Risks and benefits of procedure were discussed in detail with the patient and her husband.  All questions were answered, and consent was obtained.  The risks including damage to blood vessels and nerves with painful neuroma or numbness, limb altered function, loss of range of motion, need for further surgery, infection, complex regional pain syndrome and deep vein thrombosis were all discussed as potential risks of the surgery.,FINDINGS:,1.  There was a comminuted distal tibia fracture with a fibular shaft fracture.  Following traction, there was adequate coronal and sagittal alignment of the fracture fragments and based on the length of the fibula, the fracture fragments were out to length.,2.  The base of her proximal phalanx fracture was assessed and reduced with essentially no articular step-off and approximately 1-mm displacement.  As the reduction was stable with buddy taping, no pinning was performed.,3.  Her compartments were full, but not firm nor did she have any sign of compartment syndrome and no compartment releases were performed.,OPERATIVE REPORT IN DETAIL:  ,The patient was identified in the preoperative holding area.  The left leg was identified and marked at the surgical site of the patient.  She was then taken to the operating room where she was transferred to the operating room in the supine position, placed under general anesthesia by the anesthesiology team.  She received Ancef for antibiotic prophylaxis.  A time-out was then undertaken verifying the correct patient, extremity, visibility of preoperative markings, availability of equipment, and administration of preoperative antibiotics.  When all was verified by the surgeon, anesthesia and circulating personnel left lower extremity was prepped and draped in the usual fashion.  At this point, intraoperative fluoroscopy was used to identify the fracture site as well as the appropriate starting point both in the calcaneus for a transcalcaneal cross stent and in the proximal tibia with care taken to leave enough room for later plate fixation without contaminating the future operative site.  A single centrally threaded calcaneal cross tunnel was then placed across the calcaneus parallel to the joint surface followed by placement of 2 Schantz pins in the tibia and a frame type external fixator was then applied in traction with attempts to get the fracture fragments out to length, but not overly distract the fracture and restore coronal and sagittal alignment as much as able.  When this was adequate, the fixator apparatus was locked in place, and x-ray images were taken verifying correct placement of the hardware and adequate alignment of the fracture.  Attention was then turned to the left great toe, where a reduction of the proximal phalanx fracture was performed and buddy taping as this provided good stability and was least invasive.  X-rays were taken showing good reduction of the base of the proximal phalanx of the great toe fracture.  At this point, the pins were cut short and capped to protect the sharp ends.  The stab wounds for the Schantz pin and cross pin were covered with gauze with Betadine followed by dry gauze, and the patient was then awakened from anesthesia and transferred to the progressive care unit in stable condition.  Please note there was no break in sterile technique throughout the case.,PLAN:  ,The patient will require definitive surgical treatment in approximately 2 weeks when the soft tissues are amenable to plate and screw fixation with decreased risk of wound complication.  She will maintain her buddy taping in regards to her great toe fracture.',\n",

Xylocaine 1% was administered and a transverse antecubital incision was made over the venous limb of the graft, which was dissected out and encircled with a vessel loop.  The runoff vein was dissected out and encircled with the vessel loop as well.  A longitudinal incision was made over the venous anastomosis.  There was a narrowing in the area and slightly the incision was extended more proximally.  There was good back bleeding from the vein as well as bleeding from the more distal vein.  These were occluded with noncrushing DeBakey clamps and the patient was given 5000 units of heparin intravenously.  A #4 Fogarty was used to extract thrombus from the graft systematically until the arterial plug was removed and excellent inflow was established.  There was a narrowing in the mid portion of the venous limb of the graft, which was dilated with a #5 coronary dilator.  The Fogarty catheter was then passed up the vein, but no clot was obtained.  A patch PTFE material was fashioned and was sutured over the graftotomy with running 6-0 Gore-Tex suture.  Clamps were removed and flow established.  A thrill was easily palpable.  Hemostasis was achieved and the wound was irrigated and closed with 3-0 Vicryl subcutaneous suture followed by 4-0 nylon on the skin.  A sterile dressing was applied.

As you are well aware, he is a pleasant 64-year-old gentleman who unfortunately is suffering from end-stage COPD, who required tracheostomy tube placement about three months ago when being treated for acute exacerbation of COPD and having difficulty coming off ventilatory support.  He now resides in an extended care facility with a capped tracheostomy tube, and he unfortunately states he has had not had to use the tracheostomy tube since his discharge and admission to the extended care facility.  He requires constant oxygen administration and has been having no problems with shortness of breath, worsening, requiring opening the tracheostomy tube site.  He states there has been some tenderness associated with the tracheostomy tube and difficulty with swallowing and he wishes to have it removed.  Apparently there is no history of any airway issues while sleeping or need for uncapping the tube and essentially the tube has just remained present for months capped in his neck.  No history of any previous tracheostomy tube insertion.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: , COPD, history of hypercarbic hypoxemia, history of coronary artery disease, history of previous myocardial infarction, and history of liver cirrhosis secondary to alcohol use.,PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  ,Tonsillectomy, adenoidectomy, cholecystectomy, appendectomy, hernia repair, and tracheostomy.,FAMILY HISTORY:  ,Strong for heart disease, coronary artery disease, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and cerebrovascular accident.,CURRENT MEDICATIONS:,  Prevacid, folic acid, aspirin, morphine sulfate, Pulmicort, Risperdal, Colace, clonazepam, Lotrisone, Roxanol, Ambien, Zolpidem tartrate, simethicone, Robitussin, and prednisone.,ALLERGIES: , Nitroglycerin.,SOCIAL HISTORY: , The patient has a 25-year-smoking history, which I believe is quite heavy and he has a significant alcohol use in the past.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  ,VITAL SIGNS:  Age 64, blood pressure is 110/78, pulse 96, and temperature is 98.6.,GENERAL:  The patient was examined in his wheelchair, resting comfortably, in no acute distress.,HEAD:  Normocephalic.

History of cirrhosis of liver.,RECOMMENDATIONS: , I discussed with the patient in detail after fiberoptic laryngoscopy and limited bronchoscopy was performed in the office whether or not to pull out the tracheostomy tube.  His vocal cords moved well, and I do not see any signs of granuloma or airway obstruction either in the supraglottic or subglottic region, and I felt he would tolerate the tube being removed with close monitoring by nursing at his extended care facility.  I did impress the fact that I believe he probably will have other events requiring airway support, which could include intubation, and if the intubation is prolonged a tracheostomy may be needed.  Creation of a long-term tracheostoma may be beneficial whereas the patient would not need such a long tracheostomy tube, and I informed the patient there are other options other than the tube he has at the present time.  The patient still wished to have the tube removed and he is aware he may need to have it replaced or he may have trouble with the area healing or scarring or he could end up having an emergent airway situation with the tube gone, but wishes to have it removed, and I did remove it today.  Dressing was applied and we will see him back next week to make sure everything is healing properly.',\n",

The patient had subsequently been taken to the operating room by Department of Otolaryngology and a direct laryngoscope was performed.  The patient was noted at that time to have transglottic edema.  Biopsies were taken.  At the time of surgery, it was decided that the patient required a tracheostomy for maintenance of continued ventilation and airway protection.  The patient is currently postop day #6 and appears to be unable to be weaned from ventilator at this time and may require prolonged ventricular support.  A decision was made to perform tracheostomy change.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: , The patient was seen in the Intensive Care Unit.  The patient was placed in a supine position.  The neck was then extended.  The sutures that were previously in place in the #6 Shiley with proximal extension were removed.  The patient was preoxygenated to 100%.  After several minutes, the patient was noted to have a pulse oximetry of 100%.  The IV tubing that was supporting the patient's trache was then cut.  The tracheostomy tube was then suctioned.,The inner cannula was then removed from the tracheostomy and a nasogastric tube was placed down the lumen of the tracheostomy tube as a guidewire.  The tracheostomy tube was then removed over the nasogastric tube and the operative field was suctioned.

Nature of the proposed procedure including risks and complications involving bleeding, infection, alteration of voice, speech, or swallowing, hoarseness changing permanently, recurrence of stenosis despite a surgical intervention, airway obstruction necessitating a tracheostomy now or in the future, cardiorespiratory, and anesthetic risks were all discussed in length.  The patient states she understood and wished to proceed.,DESCRIPTION OF THE OPERATION,The patient was taken to the operating room, placed on table in supine position.  Following adequate general anesthesia, the patient was prepared for endoscopy.  The top sliding laryngoscope was then inserted in the oral cavity, pharynx, and larynx examined. In the oral cavity, she had good dentition.  Tongue and buccal cavity mucosa were without ulcers, masses, or lesions.  The oropharynx was clear.  The larynx was then manually suspended.  Epiglottis area, epiglottic folds, false cords, true vocal folds with some mild edema, but otherwise, without ulcers, masses, or lesions, and the supraglottic and glottic airway were widely patent.  The larynx was manually suspended and a 5 x 30 pediatric rigid bronchoscope was passed through the vocal folds.  At the base of the subglottis, there was a narrowing and in the upper trachea, restenosis had occurred.  Moderate amount of mucoid secretions, these were suctioned, following which the area of stenosis was dilated.  Remainder of the bronchi was then examined.  The mid and distal trachea were widely patent.  Pale pink mucosa takeoff from mainstem bronchi were widely patent without ulcers, lesions, or evidence of scarring.  The scope was pulled back and removed and following this, a 6 x 30 pediatric rigid bronchoscope was passed through the larynx and further dilatation carried out.

In fact, he had an episode three weeks ago in which he was seen at the emergency room after experiencing sudden onset of abdominal pain and vomiting. An x-ray was performed, which showed no signs of obstruction per his report.  He thinks that the inciting factor of this incident was too many grapes eaten the day before.  He has had similar symptoms suggestive of obstruction when eating oranges or other high-residue fruits in the past.  The patient's normal bowel pattern is loose stools and this is unchanged recently.  He has not had any rectal bleeding. He asks today about a rope-like vein on his anterior right arm that has been a little tender and enlarged after he was in the emergency room and they had difficulty with IV insertion.  He has not had any fever, red streaking up the arm, or enlargement of lymph nodes.  The tenderness has now completely resolved.  , ,He had a colonoscopy performed in August of 2003, by Dr. S.  An anastomotic stricture was found at the terminal ileum/cecum junction.  Dr. S recommended that if the patient experienced crampy abdominal pain or other symptoms of obstruction, that he may consider balloon dilation.  No active Crohn's disease was found during the colonoscopy.  , ,Earlier this year, he experienced a non-specific hepatitis with elevation of his liver function tests.  At that time he was taking a lot of Tylenol for migraine-type headaches.  Under Dr. S's recommendation, he stopped the Imuran for one month and reduced his dose of Tylenol.  Since that time his liver enzymes have normalized and he has restarted the Imuran with no problems.  , ,He also reports heartburn that is occurring on a slightly more frequent basis than it has in the past.

Anterior instrumentation by Uniplate construction C5, C6, and C7 (22845); with intraoperative x-ray x2.,ANESTHESIA:  ,General.,OPERATIONS: , The patient was brought to the operating room and placed in the supine position where general anesthesia was administered.  Then the anterior aspect of the neck was prepped and draped in the routine sterile fashion.  A linear skin incision was made in the skin fold line from just to the right of the midline to the leading edge of the right sternocleidomastoid muscle and taken sharply to platysma, which was dissected in a subplatysmal manner and then with only blunt dissection, the prevertebral space was encountered and localizing intraoperative x-ray was obtained once cauterized the longus colli muscle bilaterally allowed for the placement along its mesial portion of self-retaining retractors for exposure of tissues.  Prominent anterior osteophytes once identified and compared to preoperative studies were removed at C5-C6 and then at C6-C7 with rongeur, allowing for an annulotomy with an #11 blade through collapsed disc space at C5-6, and even more collapsed at C6-C7.  Gross instability appeared and though minimally at both interspaces and residual disc were removed then with the straight disc forceps providing a discectomy at both levels, sending to Pathology in a routine fashion as disc specimen.  This was sent separately and allowed for residual disc removal of power drill where drilling extended in normal cortical and cancellous elements of the C5 and C6 interspaces and at C6-C7 removing large osteophytes and process, residual osteophytes from which were removed finally with 1 and 2 mm micro Kerrison rongeurs allowing for excision of other hypertrophied ligament posteriorly as well.  This allowed for the bulging into the interspace of the dura, sign of decompressed status, and this was done widely bilaterally to decompress the nerve roots themselves and this was assured by inspection with a double ball dissector as needed.  At no time during the case was there evidence of CSF leakage and hemostasis was well achieved with pledgets of Gelfoam and subsequently removed with copious amounts of antibiotic irrigation as well as Surgifoam.  Once hemostasis well achieved, Bengal cage was filled with the patient's own bone elements of appropriate size, and this was countersunk into position and quite tightly applied it at first C5-C6, then secondly at C6-C7.  These were checked and found to be well applied and further stability was then added by placement nonetheless of a Uniplate of appropriate size.  The appropriate size screws and post-placement x-ray showed well-aligned elements and removal of osteophytes, etc.  The wound was again irrigated with antibiotic solution, inspected, and finally closed in a multiple layered closure by approximation of platysma with interrupted #3-0 Vicryl and the skin with subcuticular stitch of #4-0 Vicryl incorporating a Penrose drain from vertebral space externally through the skin wound and safety pin, and later incorporated itself into sterile bandage.,Once the bandage was placed, the patient was taken, extubated from the operating room to the Recovery area, having in stable, but guarded condition.  At the conclusion of the case, all instrument, needle, and sponge counts were accurate and correct.  There were no intraoperative complications of any type.\",\n",

The patient\\'s sister-in-law was present throughout this assessment and provided all the patient\\'s previous medical history.  Based on the sister-in-law\\'s report, the patient had a stroke on 09/19/08.  The patient spent 6 weeks at XY Medical Center, where she was subsequently transferred to XYZ for therapy for approximately 3 weeks.  ABCD brought the patient to home the Monday before Thanksgiving, because they were not satisfied with the care the patient was receiving at a skilled nursing facility in Tucson.  The patient\\'s previous medical history includes a long history of illegal drug use to include cocaine, crystal methamphetamine, and marijuana.  In March of 2008, the patient had some type of potassium issue and she was hospitalized at that time.  Prior to the stroke, the patient was not working and ABCD reported that she believes the patient completed the ninth grade, but she did not graduate from high school.  During the case history, I did pose several questions to the patient, but her response was often \"no.\"  She was very emotional during this evaluation and crying occurred multiple times.,OBJECTIVE:  ,To evaluate the patient\\'s overall communication ability, a Western Aphasia Battery was completed.  Also tests were not done due to time constraint and the patient\\'s severe difficulty and emotional state.  Speech automatic tests were also completed to determine if the patient had any functional speech.,ASSESSMENT:,  Based on the results of the Weston aphasia battery, the patient\\'s deficits most closely resemble global aphasia.  On the spontaneous speech subtest, the patient responded \"no\" to all questions asked except for how are you today where she gave a thumbs-up.  She provided no responses to picture description task and it is unclear if the patient was unable to follow the direction or if she was unable to see the picture clearly.  The patient\\'s sister-in-law did state that the patient wore glasses, but she currently does not have them and she did not know the extent the patient\\'s visual deficit.,On the auditory verbal comprehension portion of the Western Aphasia Battery, the patient answered \"no\" to all \"yes/no\" questions.  The auditory word recognition subtest, the patient had 5 out of 60 responses correct.  With the sequential command, she had 10 out of 80 corrects.  She was able to shut her eyes, point to the window, and point to the pen after directions.  With repetition subtest, she repeated bed correctly, but no other stimuli.  At this time, the patient became very emotional and repeatedly stated \"I can\\'t\".  During the naming subtest of the Western Aphasia Battery, the patient\\'s responses contained numerous paraphasias and her speech was often unintelligible due to jargon.  The word fluency test was not administered and the patient scored 2 out of 10 on the sentence completion task and 0 out of 10 on the responsive speech.  In regards to speech automatics, the patient is able to count from 1 to 9 accurately; however, stated 7 instead of 10 at the end of the task.  She is not able to state the days of the week or months in the year or her name at this time.  She cannot identify the day on calendar and was unable to verbally state the date or month.,DIAGNOSTIC IMPRESSION:  ,The patient\\'s communication deficits most closely resemble global aphasia where she has difficulty with both receptive as well as expressive communication.  She does perseverate and is very emotional due to probable frustration.  Outpatient skilled speech therapy is recommended to improve the patient\\'s functional communication skills.,PATIENT GOAL: , Her sister-in-law stated that they would like to improve upon the patient\\'s speech to allow her to communicate more easily at home.,PLAN OF CARE: , Outpatient skilled speech therapy two times a week for the next 12 weeks.  Therapy to include aphasia treatment and home activities.,SHORT-TERM GOALS (8 WEEKS):,1.  The patient will answer simple \"yes/no\" questions with greater than 90% accuracy with minimal cueing.,2.  The patient will be able to complete speech automatic tasks with greater than 80% accuracy without models or cueing.,3.  The patient will be able to complete simple sentence completion and/or phrase completion with greater than 80% accuracy with minimal cueing.,4.  The patient will be able to follow simple one-step commands with greater than 80% accuracy with minimal cueing.,5.  The patient will be able to name 10 basic everyday objects with greater than 80% accuracy with minimal cueing.,SHORT-TERM GOALS (12 WEEKS):,  Functional communication abilities to allow the patient to express her basic wants and needs.',\n",

The patient states that he was working in his garage over the past few days when he noticed some redness and edema in his right foot.  He notes some itching as well as increasing pain and redness in the right foot and presented to ABCD General Hospital Emergency Room.  He was evaluated by the Emergency Room staff as well as the medical team and the Department of Orthopedics.  It was noted upon x-ray a foreign body in his foot and he had significant amount of cellulitis as well ________ right lower extremity.  After a long discussion held with the patient, it was elected to proceed with irrigation debridement and removal of the foreign body.,PROCEDURE: , After all potential complications, risks, as well as anticipated benefits of the above-named procedures were discussed at length with the patient, informed consent was obtained.  The operative extremity was then confirmed with the patient, operative surgeon, the Department of Anesthesia and nursing staff.  The patient was then transferred to preoperative area to Operative Suite #5 and placed on the operating table in supine position.  All bony prominences were well padded at this time.  The Department of Anesthesia was administered spinal anesthetic to the patient.  Once this anesthesia was obtained, the patient's right lower extremity was sterilely prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  Upon viewing of the plantar aspect of the foot, there was noted to be a swollen ecchymotic area with a small hole in it, which purulent fluid was coming from.  At this time, after all bony and soft tissue landmarks were identified as well as the localization of the pus, a 2 cm longitudinal incision was made directly over this area, which was located between the second and third metatarsal heads.  Upon incising this, there was a foul smelling purulent fluid, which flowed from this region.  Aerobic and anaerobic cultures were taken as well as gram stain.  The area was explored and it ________ to the dorsum of the foot.  There was no obvious joint involvement.  After all loculations were broken, 3 liters antibiotic-impregnated fluid were pulse-evac through the wound.  The wound was again inspected with no more gross purulent or necrotic appearing tissue.  The wound was then packed with an iodoform gauge and a sterile dressing was applied consisting of 4x4s, floss, and Kerlix covered by an Ace bandage.  At this time, the Department of Anesthesia reversed the sedation.  The patient was transferred back to the hospital gurney to Postanesthesia Care Unit.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and there were no complications.,DISPOSITION:  ,The patient will be followed on a daily basis for possible repeat irrigation debridement.\",\n",

Rigid bronchoscopy with removal of foreign body, prolonged procedure taking two hours to remove the stent piecemeal in a very difficult and trying situation.,2.  Excision of granulation tissue tumor.,3.  Bronchial dilation with a balloon bronchoplasty, right main bronchus.,4.  Argon plasma coagulation to control bleeding in the trachea.,5.  Placement of a tracheal and bilateral bronchial stents with a silicon wire stent.,ENDOSCOPIC FINDINGS:,1.  Normal true vocal cords.,2.  Proximal trachea with high-grade occlusion blocking approximately 90% of the trachea due to granulation tissue tumor and break down of metallic stent.,3.  Multiple stent fractures in the mid portion of the trachea with granulation tissue.,4.  High-grade obstruction of the right main bronchus by stent and granulation tissue.,5.  Left main bronchus was covered by the distal portion of the stent and was only being ventilated through the struts of the stent.,6.  All in all a high-grade terrible airway obstruction with involvement of the carina, left and right main stem bronchus, mid, distal, and proximal trachea.,TECHNIQUE IN DETAIL: , After informed consent was obtained from the patient, he was brought into the operating field.  A rapid sequence induction was done.  He was intubated with a rigid scope.  Jet ventilation technique was carried out using a rigid and flexible scope.  A thorough airway inspection was carried out with findings as described above.,Dr. D was present in the operating room and we conferred on operative strategy and agreed that the best of strategy would be to first dilate the right main bronchus, cauterize it to control bleeding and then piecemeal removed the stent from distal to proximal.  This is the technique that was carried out in a painstaking fashion removing bits of the stent piecemeal with finally getting all of the visible stent out of the airway.  It should be noted that Dr. Donovan and I felt that two of the metallic stents were probably in place but we cannot be sure because of the terrible anatomy and the fact that the stent pieces were coming out twisted metal in fragments.  Nevertheless, all the visible stent was removed, and the airway was much better after with the dilation of balloon and the rigid scope.  We took measurements and decided to place stents in the trachea, left and right main bronchus using a Dumon Y-stent.  It was measured 18 mm in tracheal diameter and 14 mm in bronchial diameter.  The right main stem stent was 2.25 cm in length, the left main stem stent was 3 cm in length and the tracheal portion was 9 cm in length.  After it was placed, excellent placement was achieved with the proximal end of the stent 3 cm below the true vocal cords.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and was brought to the recovery room extubated.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION:,  The patient was brought to the operating room and appropriately identified.  Local anesthesia was obtained with a 50/50 mixture of 2% lidocaine and 0.75% bupivacaine given as a peribulbar block.  The patient was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  A lid speculum was used to provide exposure to the right eye.,A limited conjunctival peritomy was created with Westcott scissors to expose the supranasal and, separately, the supratemporal and inferotemporal quadrants.  Calipers were set at 3.5 mm and a mark was made 3.5 mm posterior to the limbus in the inferotemporal quadrant.,A 5-0 nylon suture was passed through partial-thickness sclera on either side of this mark.  The MVR blade was used to make a sclerotomy between the pre-placed sutures.  An 8-0 nylon suture was then pre-placed for later sclerotomy closure.  The infusion cannula was inspected and found to be in good working order.  The infusion cannula was placed in the vitreous cavity and secured with the pre-placed sutures.  The tip of the infusion cannula was directly visualized and found to be free of any overlying tissue and the infusion was turned on.,Additional sclerotomies were made 3.5 mm posterior to the limbus in the supranasal and supratemporal quadrants.  The light pipe and vitrectomy handpieces were then placed in the vitreous cavity and a vitrectomy was performed.  There was moderately severe vitreous hemorrhage, which was removed.  Once a view of the posterior pole could be obtained, there were some diabetic membranes emanating along the arcades.  These were dissected with curved scissors and judicious use of the vitrectomy cutter.  There was some bleeding from the inferotemporal frond.  This was managed by raising the intraocular pressure and using intraocular cautery.  The surgical view became cloudy and the corneal epithelium was removed with a beaver blade.  This improved the view.  There is an area suspicious for retinal break near where the severe traction was inferotemporally.  The Endo laser was used to treat in a panretinal scatter fashion to areas that had not received previous treatment.  The indirect ophthalmoscope was used to examine the retinal peripheral for 360 degrees and no tears, holes or dialyses were seen.  There was some residual hemorrhagic vitreous skirt seen.  The soft-tip cannula was then used to perform an air-fluid exchange.  Additional laser was placed around the suspicious area inferotemporally.  The sclerotomies were then closed with 8-0 nylon suture in an X-fashion, the infusion cannula was removed and it sclerotomy closed with the pre-existing 8-0 nylon suture.,The conjunctiva was closed with 6-0 plain gut.  A subconjunctival injection of Ancef and Decadron were given and a drop of atropine was instilled over the eye.  The lid speculum was removed.  Maxitrol ointment was instilled over the eye and the eye was patched.  The patient was brought to the recovery room in stable condition.',\n",

She received treatment from Dr. X and also Dr. Y,DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES:,  June 27, 2006, EMG and nerve conduction velocity right upper extremity showed a moderate right carpal tunnel syndrome.  No evidence of a right cervical radiculopathy or ulnar neuropathy at the wrist or elbow.  January 29, 2007, EMG right upper extremity was normal and there was a normal nerve conduction velocity.  At the time of the examination, she complained of a constant pain in the olecranon and distal triceps with tingling in the right long, ring and small fingers, and night pain.  The pain was accentuated by gripping or opening the jar.  She is taking four Aleve a day and currently does not have any other treatment.,RECORDS REVIEWED: , Injury and illness incident report, US Healthworks records; Z physician review; Y office notes; X office notes who noted that on examination of the right elbow that the ulnar nerve subluxed with flexion and extension of the elbow.,EXAMINATION: , Examination of her right elbow revealed no measurable atrophy of the upper arm.  She was markedly tender over the medial epicondyle, but also the olecranon and distal process and she was exquisitely tender over the ulnar nerve.  I did not detect subluxation of the ulnar nerve with flexion and extension.  With this, she was extremely tender in this area.  There is no instability of the elbow.  Range of motion was 0 to 145 degrees, flexion 90 degrees of pronation and supination.  The elbow flexion test was positive.  There is normal motor power in the elbow and also on the right hand, specifically in the ulnar intrinsics.  There was diminished sensation on the right ring and small fingers, specifically the ulnar side of the ring finger of the entire small finger.  There was no wasting of the intrinsics.  No clawing of the hand.  Examination of the right wrist revealed extension 45 degrees, flexion 45 degrees, radial deviation 15 degrees, and ulnar deviation 35 degrees.  She was tender over the dorsum of the hand over the ulnar head and the volar aspect of the wrist.  Wrist flexion causes paresthesias on the right ring and small fingers.  Grasp was weak.  There was no sign of causalgia, but no measurable atrophy of the forearm.  No reflex changes.,QUESTION:,  Ms. Xxxxx has filed an application of additional allowance of right cubital tunnel syndrome.  Based on the current objective findings, mechanism of injury, medical records or diagnostic studies, does the medical evidence support the existence of the requested condition?,ANSWER:,  Yes.  She has a positive elbow flexion test and she is markedly tender over the ulnar nerve at the elbow and also has diminished sensation in the ulnar nerve distribution, specifically in the entire right small finger and the ulnar half of the ring finger.  I did not find the subluxation of the ulnar nerve with flexion and extension with Dr. X did previously find on his examination.,QUESTION: , If you find these conditions exist, are they a direct and proximate result of April 26, 2006, injury?,ANSWER: , Yes.  Repeated flexion and extension would irritate the ulnar nerve particularly if it was subluxing which it could very well have which Dr. X objectively identified on his examination.  Therefore, I believe it is a direct and proximate result of April 26, 2006, injury.,QUESTION: , Do you find that Ms. Xxxxx's injury or disability is caused by natural deterioration of tissue, organ or part of the body?,ANSWER: , No.,QUESTION:,  In addition, if you find that the condition exists, are there non-occupational activities or intervening injuries that could have contributed to Ms. Xxxxx's condition?,ANSWER: , It is possible that direct injury to the ulnar nerve at the elbow could cause this syndrome; however, there is no history of this and the records do not indicate an injury of this type.,QUESTION: ,\",\n",
       " 'CHIEF COMPLAINT:,  Status epilepticus.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  ,The patient is a 6-year-old male who is a former 27-week premature infant who suffered an intraventricular hemorrhage requiring shunt placement, and as a result, has developmental delay and left hemiparesis.  At baseline, he can put about 2 to 4 words together in brief sentences.  His speech is not always easily understood; however, he is in a special education classroom in kindergarten.  He ambulates independently, but falls often.  He has difficulty with his left side compared to the right, and prefers to use the right upper extremity more than the left.  Mother reports he postures the left upper extremity when running.  He is being followed by Medical Therapy Unit and has also been seen in the past by Dr. X.  He has not received Botox or any other interventions with regard to his cerebral palsy.,The patient did require one shunt revision, but since then his shunt has done well.,The patient developed seizures about 2 years ago.  These occurred periodically, but they are always in the same and with the involvement of the left side more than right and he had an eye deviation forcefully to the left side.  His events, however, always tend to be prolonged.  He has had seizures as long as an hour and a half.  He tends to require multiple medications to stop them.  He has been followed by Dr. Y and was started on Trileptal.  At one point, The patient was taken off his medication for presumed failure to prevent his seizures.  He was more recently placed on Topamax since March 2007.  His last seizures were in March and May respectively.  He is worked up to a dose of 25 mg capsules, 2 capsules twice a day or about 5 mg/kg/day at this point.,The patient was in his usual state of health until early this morning and was noted to be in seizure.  His seizure this morning was similar to the previous seizures with forced deviation of his head and eyes to the left side and convulsion more on the left side than the right.  Family administered Diastat 7.5 mg x1 dose.  They did not know they could repeat this dose.  EMS was called and he received lorazepam 2 mg and then in the emergency department, 15 mg/kg of fosphenytoin.  His seizures stopped thereafter, since that time, he had gradually become more alert and is eating, and is nearly back to baseline.  He is a bit off balance and tends to be a bit weaker on the left side compared to baseline postictally.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: , At this time, he is positive for a low-grade fever, he has had no signs of illness otherwise.  He does have some fevers after his prolonged seizures.  He denies any respiratory or cardiovascular complaints.  There is no numbness or loss of skills.  He has no rashes, arthritis or arthralgias.  He has no oropharyngeal complaints.  Visual or auditory complaints.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: , Also positive for some mild scoliosis.,SOCIAL HISTORY: , The patient lives at home with mother, father, and 2 other siblings.  There are no ill contacts.,FAMILY HISTORY: , Noncontributory.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,GENERAL:  The patient is a well-nourished, well-hydrated male, in no acute distress.,VITAL SIGNS:  His vital signs are stable and he is currently afebrile.,HEENT:  Atraumatic and normocephalic.  Oropharynx shows no lesions.,NECK:  Supple without adenopathy.,CHEST:  Clear to auscultation.,CARDIOVASCULAR:  Regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs.,ABDOMEN:  Benign without organomegaly.,EXTREMITIES:  No clubbing, cyanosis or edema.,NEUROLOGIC:  The patient is alert and will follow instructions.  His speech is very dysarthric and he tends to run his words together.  He is about 50% understandable at best.  He does put words and sentences together.  His cranial nerves reveal his pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light.  His extraocular movements are intact.  His visual fields are full.  Disks are sharp bilaterally.  His face shows left facial weakness postictally.  His palate elevates midline.  Vision is intact bilaterally.  Tongue protrudes midline.,Motor exam reveals clearly decreased strength on the left side at baseline.  His left thigh is abducted at the hip at rest with the right thigh and leg straight.  He has difficulty using the left arm and while reaching for objects, shows exaggerated tremor/dysmetria.  Right upper extremity is much more on target.  His sensations are intact to light touch bilaterally.  Deep tendon reflexes are 2+ and symmetric.  When sitting up, he shows some truncal instability and tendency towards decreased truncal tone and kyphosis.  He also shows some scoliotic curve of the spine, which is mild at this point.  Gait was not tested today.,IMPRESSION: , This is a 6-year-old male with recurrent status epilepticus, left hemiparesis, history of prematurity, and intraventricular hemorrhage.  He is on Topamax, which is at a moderate dose of 5 mg/kg a day or 50 mg twice a day.  At this point, it is not clear whether this medication will protect him or not, but the dose is clearly not at maximum, and he is tolerating the dose currently.  The plan will be to increase him up to 50 mg in the morning, and 75 mg at night for 2 weeks, and then 75 mg twice daily.  Reviewed the possible side effects of higher doses of Topamax, they will monitor him for language issues, cognitive problems or excessive somnolence.  I also discussed his imaging studies, which showed significant destruction of the cerebellum compared to other areas and despite this, the patient at baseline has a reasonable balance.  The plan from CT standpoint is to continue stretching program, continue with medical therapy unit.  He may benefit from Botox.,In addition, I reviewed the Diastat protocol with parents and given the patient tends to go into status epilepticus each time, they can administer Diastat immediately and not wait the standard 2 minutes or even 5 minutes that they were waiting before.  They are going to repeat the dose within 10 minutes and they can call EMS at any point during that time.  Hopefully at home, they need to start to abort these seizures or the higher dose of Topamax will prevent them.  Other medication options would include Keppra, Zonegran or Lamictal.,FOLLOWUP: , Followup has already been scheduled with Dr. Y in February and they will continue to keep that date for followup.',\n",

The skin, subcutaneous tissue, and fascia of the pectoralis major muscle medially beneath the inferior third of the right clavicle was infiltrated with 0.5% Marcaine with epinephrine.  An incision transverse, parallel, and inferior to the middle third of the right clavicle was performed.  A subcutaneous pocket on the surface of the pectoralis major muscle was created.  The muscular fascia was also infiltrated with 0.5% Marcaine with epinephrine.  With the patient in the Trendelenburg position, utilizing the provided introducer needle, the right subclavian vein was cannulated.  A guidewire was passed without difficulty and the needle was removed.  Fluoroscopy confirmed satisfactory position of the guidewire in the right atrium.  A dilator and sheath was passed over the guidewire.  The guidewire and dilator were removed and a provided catheter was inserted through the sheath and the sheath was carefully withdrawn.  Fluoroscopy again confirmed satisfactory position of the catheter and the catheter under fluoroscopic guidance was retracted into the superior vena cava.  The catheter had been preflushed with dilute heparin solution (100 units/mL).  The port, which had been preflushed with saline, was attached to the catheter at approximately 13 cm level.  The locking cap had been placed on the catheter.  The port was connected to the catheter and the locking cap was secured.  The port was again flushed with dilute heparin solution and placed within the subcutaneous pocket.  Fluoroscopy again confirmed satisfactory position.  A hard copy of the fluoroscopy was obtained.  The catheter and port were secured to the pectoralis fascia in four locations with 2-0 Prolene suture.  Site was irrigated with saline.  Hemostasis was verified.  The subcutaneous tissue was approximated with interrupted 2-0 Vicryl suture.  The subcutaneous and dermis were closed with a running subcuticular 3-0 Vicryl suture.  A 0.25-inch Steri-Strips were applied.  The provided needle and butterfly attachment was flushed with saline, passed through the skin into the port, and then flushed again with dilute heparin solution thus confirmed satisfactory.  The site was dressed with Tegaderm type dressing and the needle catheters were covered with 4x4's and paper tape.  Estimated blood loss was less than 15 mL.

Preoperative evaluation included a CT scan, which showed focal mass.  CT and PET confirmed anterior lesion.  Therefore the patient was seen in our thoracic tumor board where it was recommended to have resection performed with chest wall reconstruction.  In the outpatient setting, the patient was willing to proceed.,PROCEDURE PERFORMED IN DETAIL: , After informed consent was obtained, the patient identified correctly.  She was taken to the operating room where an epidural catheter was placed by Anesthesia without difficulty.  She was sedated and intubated with double-lumen endotracheal tube without difficulty.  She was positioned with left side up.  Appropriate pressure points were padded.  The left chest was prepped and draped in the standard surgical fashion.  The skin incision was made in the posterior axillary line, approximately 7th intercostal space with #10 blade, taken down through tissues and Bovie electrocautery.,Pleura was entered.  There was good deflation of the left lung.  __________ port was placed, followed by the 0-degree 10-mm scope with appropriate patient positioning.  Posteriorly a pedunculated 2.5 x 3-cm pleural-based mass was identified on the anterior chest wall.  There were thin adhesions to the pleura, but no invasion of the chest wall that could be identified.  The tumor was very mobile and was on a pedunculated stalk, approximately 1.5 cm.  It was felt that this could be resected without the need of chest wall reconstruction because of the narrow stalk.,Therefore a 2nd port was placed in the anterior axillary line approximately 8th intercostal space in the usual fashion.  Camera was placed through this port.  Laparoscopic scissors were placed through the posterior port, but it was necessary to have another instrument to provide more tension than just gravity.  Therefore because of the need to bring the specimen through the chest wall, a small 3-cm thoracotomy was made, which incorporated the posterior port site.  This was taken down to the subcutaneous tissue with Bovie electrocautery.  Periosteal elevator was used to lift the intercostal muscle off.  The ribs were not spread.  Through this 3-cm incision, both the laparoscopic scissors as well as Prestige graspers could be placed.  Prestige graspers were used to pull the specimen from the chest wall.  Care was taken not to injure the capsule.  The laparoscopic scissors on cautery were used to resect the parietal pleural off of the chest wall.  Care was taken not to transect the stalk.  Specimen came off the chest wall very easily.  There was good hemostasis.,At this point, the EndoCatch bag was placed through the incision.  Specimen was placed in the bag and then removed from the field.  There was good hemostasis.  Camera was removed.  A 24-French chest tube was placed through the anterior port and secured with 2-0 silk suture.  The posterior port site was closed 1st with 2-0 Vicryl in a running fashion for the intercostal muscle layer, followed by 2-0 closure of the latissimus fascia as well as subdermal suture, 4-0 Monocryl was used for the skin, followed by Steri-Strips and sterile drapes.  The patient tolerated the procedure well, was extubated in the operating room and returned to the recovery room in stable condition.',\n",

The patient was given prophylactic antibiotic in the preoperative holding area.  The patient was then positioned, prepped and draped.  Cystoscopy was then performed by using a #26-French continuous flow resectoscopic sheath and a visual obturator.  The prostatic urethra appeared to be moderately hypertrophied due to the lateral lobes and a large median lobe.  The anterior urethra was normal without strictures or lesions.  The bladder was severely trabeculated with multiple bladder diverticula.  There is a very bladder diverticula located in the right posterior bladder wall just proximal to the trigone.  Using the ***** resection apparatus and a right angle resection loop, the prostate was resected initially at the area of the median lobe.  Once the median lobe has completely resected, the left lateral lobe and then the right lateral lobes were taken down.  Once an adequate channel had been achieved, the prostatic specimen was retrieved from the bladder by using an Ellik evacuator.  A 3-mm bar electrode was then introduced into the prostate to achieve perfect hemostasis.

Chest x-ray and CT scan revealed a 3 cm x 4 cm mass abutting the left chest wall inferior to the left scapula with pleural thickening.  A biopsy was performed at an outside hospital (Kaiser) and pathology was consistent with mesothelioma.  The patient had a metastatic workup, which was negative including a brain MRI and bone scan.  The bone scan showed only signal positivity in the left 9th rib near the tumor.  The patient has a significant past medical history consisting of coronary artery disease, hypertension, non-insulin dependent diabetes, longstanding atrial fibrillation, anemia, and hypercholesterolemia.  He and his family were apprised of the high-risk nature of this surgery preoperatively and informed consent was obtained.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , The patient was brought to the operating room and placed in the supine position.  The patient was intubated with a double-lumen endotracheal tube.  Intravenous antibiotics were given.  A Foley catheter was placed.  The patient was placed in the right lateral decubitus position and the left chest was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  An incision approximately 8 inches long was made centered over the mass and extending slightly obliquely over the mass.  The skin and subcutaneous tissues were dissected sharply with the electrocautery.  Good hemostasis was obtained.  The tumor was easily palpable and clearly involving the 8th to 9th rib.  A thoracotomy was initially made above the mass in approximately the 7th intercostal space.  Inspection of the pleural cavity revealed multiple adhesions, which were taken down with a combination of blunt and sharp dissection.  The thoracotomy was extended anteriorly and posteriorly.  It was clear that in order to obtain an adequate resection of the tumor, approximately 4 rib segment of the chest wall would need to be resected.  The ribs of the chest wall were first cut at their anterior aspect.  The ribs 7, 8, 9, and 10 were serially transected after the interspaces were dissected with electrocautery.  Hemostasis was obtained with both electrocautery and clips.  The chest wall segment to be resected was retracted laterally and posteriorly.  It was clear that there were at least 2 areas where the tumor was invading the lung and a lengthy area of diaphragmatic involvement.  Inferiorly, the diaphragm was divided to provide a margin of at least 1 to 2 cm around the areas of tumor.  The spleen and the stomach were identified and were protected.  Inferiorly, the resection of the chest wall was continued in the 10th interspace.  The dissection was then carried posteriorly to the level of the spine.  The left lung at this point was further dissected out and multiple firings of the GIA 75 were used to perform a wedge resection of the left lower lobe, which provided a complete resection of all palpable and visible tumor in the lung.  A 2-0 silk tie was used to ligate the last remaining corner of lung parenchyma at the corner of the wedge resection.  Posteriorly, the chest wall segment was noted to have an area at the level of approximately T8 and T9, where the tumor involved the vertebral bodies.  The ribs were disarticulated, closed to or at their articulations with the spine.  Bleeding from the intercostal vessels was controlled with a combination of clips and electrocautery.  There was no disease grossly involving or encasing the aorta.,The posterior transection of the ribs was completed and the specimen was passed off of the field as a specimen to pathology for permanent section.  The specimen was oriented for the pathologist who came to the room.  Hemostasis was obtained.  The vent in the diaphragm was then closed primarily with a series of figure-of-8 #1 Ethibond sutures.  This produced a satisfactory diaphragmatic repair without undue tension.  A single 32-French chest tube was placed in the pleural cavity exiting the left hemithorax anteriorly.  This was secured with a #1 silk suture.  The Gore-Tex mesh was brought on to the field and was noted to be of adequate size to patch the resulting chest wall defect.  A series of #1 Prolene were placed in an interrupted horizontal mattress fashion circumferentially and tied down individually.  The resulting mesh closure was snug and deemed adequate.  The serratus muscle was reapproximated with figure-of-8 0 Vicryl.  The latissimus was reapproximated with a two #1 Vicryl placed in running fashion.  Of note, two #10 JP drains were placed over the mesh repair of the chest wall.  The subcutaneous tissues were closed with a running 3-0 Vicryl suture and the skin was closed with a 4-0 Monocryl.  The wounds were dressed.  The patient was brought from the operating room directly to the North ICU, intubated in stable condition.  All counts were correct.,',\n",

Atrial fibrillation.  The patient is currently hemodynamically stable, tolerating her dysrhythmia.  However, given the risk of thromboembolic complications, would like to convert to normal sinus rhythm if possible.  Given that she was in normal sinus rhythm approximately 24 hours ago, this is relatively acute onset within the last 24 hours.  We will initiate therapy with amiodarone 150 mg intravenous (IV) bolus followed by mg/minute at this juncture.  If she does not have spontaneous cardioversion, we will consider either electrical cardioversion or anticoagulation with heparin within 24 hours from initiation of amiodarone.,As part of amiodarone protocol, please check TSH.  Given her preexisting mild elevation of transaminases, we will follow LFTs closely, while on amiodarone.,2.  Thromboembolic risk prophylaxis, as discussed above.  No immediate indication for anticoagulation.  If however she does not have spontaneous conversion within the next 24 hours, we will need to initiate therapy.  This was discussed with Dr. X.  Preference would be to run intravenous heparin with PTT of 45 during her thrombocytopenic nadir and initiation of full-dose anticoagulation once nadir is resolved.,3.  Congestive heart failure.  The patient is clinically euvolemic.  Elevated BNP possibly secondary to infarct or renal insufficiency.  Follow volume status closely.  Follow serial BNPs.,4.  Followup.

Informed consent was obtained. On the day of surgery, (s)he received several sets of drops in the XXX eye including 2.5% phenylephrine, 1% Mydriacyl, 1% Cyclogyl, Ocuflox and Acular. (S)he was taken to the operating room and sedated via IV sedation. 2% lidocaine jelly was placed in the XXX eye (or, retrobulbar anesthesia was performed using a 50/50 mixture of 2% lidocaine and 0.75% marcaine). The XXX eye was prepped using a 10% Betadine solution. (S)he was covered in sterile drapes leaving only the XXX eye exposed. A Lieberman lid speculum was placed to provide exposure. The Thornton fixation ring and a Superblade were used to create a paracentesis at approximately 2 (or 11 depending upon side and handedness, and assuming superior incision) o'clock. Then 1% lidocaine was injected through the paracentesis. After the nonpreserved lidocaine was injected, Viscoat was injected through the paracentesis to fill the anterior chamber. The Thornton fixation ring and a 2.75 mm keratome blade were used to create a two-step full-thickness clear corneal incision superiorly. The cystitome and Utrata forceps were used to create a continuous capsulorrhexis in the anterior lens capsule. BSS on a hydrodissection cannula was used to perform gentle hydrodissection. Phacoemulsification was then performed to remove the nucleus. I & A was performed to remove the remaining cortical material. Provisc was injected to fill the capsular bag and anterior chamber. A XXX diopter SN60AT (for Acrysof natural lens) intraocular lens was injected into the capsular bag. The Kuglen hook was used to rotate it into proper position in the capsular bag. I & A was performed to remove the remaining Viscoelastic material from the eye. BSS on the 30-gauge cannula was used to hydrate the wound. The wounds were checked and found to be watertight. The lid speculum and drapes were carefully removed. Several drops of Ocuflox were placed in the XXX eye. The eye was covered with an eye shield.

       " 'PROCEDURES: , Total knee replacement.,PROCEDURE DESCRIPTION:,  The patient was bought to the operating room and placed in the supine position.  After induction of anesthesia, a tourniquet was placed on the upper thigh.  Sterile prepping and draping proceeded.  The tourniquet was inflated to 300 mmHg.  A midline incision was made, centered over the patella.  Dissection was sharply carried down through the subcutaneous tissues.  A median parapatellar arthrotomy was performed.  The lateral patellar retinacular ligaments were released and the patella was retracted laterally.  Proximal medial tibia was denuded, with mild release of medial soft tissues.  The ACL and PCL were released.  The medial and lateral menisci and suprapatellar fat pad were removed.  These releases allowed for anterior subluxation of tibia.  An extramedullary tibial cutting jig was pinned to the proximal tibia in the appropriate alignment and flush cut was made along tibial plateau, perpendicular to the axis of the tibia.  Its alignment was checked with the rod and found to be adequate.  The tibia was then allowed to relocate under the femur.,An intramedullary hole was drilled into the femur and a femoral rod attached to the anterior cutting block was inserted, and the block was pinned in appropriate position, judging correct rotation using a variety of techniques.  An anterior rough cut was made.  The distal cutting jig was placed atop this cut surface and pinned to the distal femur, and the rod was removed.  The distal cut was performed.,A spacer block was placed, and adequate balance in extension was adjusted and confirmed, as was knee alignment.  Femoral sizing was performed with the sizer, and the appropriate size femoral 4-in-1 chamfer-cutting block was pinned in place and the cuts were made.  The notch-cutting block was pinned to the cut surface, slightly laterally, and the notch cut was then made.  The trial femoral component was impacted onto the distal femur and found to have an excellent fit.  A trial tibial plate and polyethylene were inserted, and stability was judged and found to be adequate in all planes.  Appropriate rotation of the tibial component was identified and marked.  The trials were removed and the tibia was brought forward again.  The tibial plate size was checked and the plate was pinned to plateau.  A keel guide was placed and the keel was then made.  The femoral intramedullary hole was plugged with bone from the tibia.  The trial tibial component and poly placed; and, after placement of the femoral component, range of motion and stability were checked and found to be adequate in various ranges of flexion and extension.,The patella was held in a slightly everted position with knee in extension.  Patellar width was checked with calipers.  A free-hand cut of the patellar articular surface was performed and checked to ensure symmetry with the calipers.  Sizing was then performed and 3 lug holes were drilled with the jig in place, taking care to medialize and superiorize the component as much as possible, given bony anatomy.  Any excess lateral patellar bone was recessed.  The trial patellar component was placed and found to have adequate tracking.  The trials were removed; and as the cement was mixed, all cut surfaces were thoroughly washed and dried.  The cement was applied to the components and the cut surfaces with digital pressurization, and then the components were impacted.  The excess cement was removed from the gutters and anterior and posterior parts of the knee.  The knee was brought into full extension with the trial polyethylene and further axially pressurized as cement hardened.  Once the cement had hardened, the tourniquet was deflated.  The knee was dislocated again, and any excess cement was removed with an osteotome.  Thorough irrigation and hemostasis were performed.  The real polyethylene component was placed and pinned.  Further vigorous power irrigation was performed, and adequate hemostasis was obtained and confirmed.  The arthrotomy was closed using 0 Ethibond and Vicryl sutures.  The subcutaneous tissues were closed after further irrigation with 2-0 Vicryl and Monocryl sutures.  The skin was sealed with staples.  Xeroform and a sterile dressing were applied followed by a cold-pack and Ace wrap.  The patient was transferred to the recovery room in stable condition, having tolerated the procedure well.',\n",

Partial rhinectomy.,ANESTHESIA:,  General endotracheal.,INDICATIONS: , This is an 81-year-old gentleman who underwent septorhinoplasty many years ago.  He also has a history of a skin lesion, which was removed from the nasal ala many years ago, the details of which he does not recall.  He has been complaining of tenderness and induration of his nasal tip for approximately two years and has been treated unsuccessfully for folliculitis and cellulitis of the nasal tip.  He was evaluated by Dr. A, who performed the septorhinoplasty, and underwent an intranasal biopsy, which showed histologic evidence of invasive squamous cell carcinoma.  The preoperative examination shows induration of the nasal tip without significant erythema.  There is focal tenderness just cephalad to the alar crease.  There is no lesion either externally or intranasally.,PROCEDURE AND FINDINGS: , The patient was taken to the operating room and placed in supine position.  Following induction of adequate general endotracheal anesthesia, the left nose was decongested with Afrin.  He was prepped and draped in standard fashion.  The left nasal cavity was examined by anterior rhinoscopy.  The septum was midline.  There was slight asymmetry of the nares.  No lesion was seen within the nasal cavity either in the area of the intercartilaginous area, which was biopsied by Dr. A, the septum, the lateral nasal wall, and the floor.  The 0-degree nasal endoscope was then used to examine the nasal cavity more completely.  No lesion was detectable.  A left intercartilaginous incision was made with a #15 blade since this was the area of previous biopsy by Dr. A.  The submucosal tissue was thickened diffusely, but there was no identifiable distinct or circumscribed lesion present.  Random biopsies of the submucosal tissue were taken and submitted to pathology for frozen section.  A diagnosis of diffuse invasive squamous cell carcinoma was rendered.  An alar incision was made with a #15 blade and the full-thickness incision was completed with the electrocautery.  The incision was carried more cephalad through the lower lateral cartilage up to the area of the upper lateral cartilage at the superior margin.  The full unit of the left nasal tip was excised completely and submitted to pathology after tagging and labeling it.  Frozen section examination again revealed diffuse squamous cell carcinoma throughout the soft tissues involving all margins.  Additional soft tissue was then taken from all margins tagging them for the pathologist.  The inferior margins were noted to be clear on the next frozen section report, but there was still disease present in the region of the upper lateral cartilage at its insertion with the nasal bone.  A Joseph elevator was used to elevate the periosteum off the maxillary process and off the inferior aspect of the nasal bone.  Additional soft tissue was taken in these regions along the superior margin.  The frozen section examination revealed persistent disease medially and additional soft tissue was taken and submitted to pathology.  Once all margins had been cleared histologically, additional soft tissue was taken from the entire wound.  A 5-mm chisel was used to take down the inferior aspect of the nasal bone and the medial-most aspect of the maxilla.  This was all submitted to pathology for routine permanent examination.  Xeroform gauze was then fashioned to cover the defect and was sutured along the periphery of the wound with interrupted 6-0 nylon suture to provide a barrier and moisture.  The anesthetic was then discontinued as the patient was extubated and transferred to the PACU in good condition having tolerated the procedure well.  Sponge and needle counts were correct.',\n",

The left had atrophic or dysplastic vas and epididymis.,TUBES AND DRAINS: , No tubes or drains were used.,INDICATIONS FOR OPERATION:  ,The patient is a 7-1/2-month-old boy with bilateral nonpalpable testes.  Plan is for exploration, possible orchiopexy.,DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION:  ,The patient was taken to the operating room where surgical consent, operative site, and patient identification were verified.  Once he was anesthetized, he was then palpated and again both testes were nonpalpable.  Because of this, a laparoscopic approach was then elected.  We then sterilely prepped and draped the patient, put an 8-French feeding tube in the urethra, attached to bulb grenade for drainage.  We then made an infraumbilical incision with a 15-blade knife and then further extended with electrocautery and with curved mosquito clamps down to the rectus fascia where we made stay sutures of 3-0 Monocryl on the anterior and posterior sheaths and then opened up the fascia with the curved Metzenbaum scissors.  Once we got into the peritoneum, we placed a 5-mm port with 0-degree short lens.  Insufflation was then done with carbon dioxide up to 10 to 12 mmHg.  We then evaluated.  There was no bleeding noted.  He had a closed ring on the left with a small testis that was evaluated and found to have short vessels as well as atrophic or dysplastic vas, which was barely visualized.  The right side was also intraabdominal, but slightly larger, had better vessels, had much more recognizable vas, and it was closer to the internal ring.  So, we elected to do an orchiopexy on the right side.  Using the laparoscopic 3- and 5-mm dissecting scissors, we then opened up the window at the internal ring through the peritoneal tissue, then dissected it medially and laterally along the line of the vas and along the line of the vessels up towards the kidney, mid way up the abdomen, and across towards the bladder for the vas.  We then used the Maryland dissector to gently tease this tissue once it was incised.  The gubernaculum was then divided with electrocautery and the laparoscopic scissors.  We were able to dissect with the hook dissector in addition to the scissors the peritoneal shunts with the vessels and the vas to the point where we could actually stretch and bring the testis across to the other side, left side of the ring.  We then made a curvilinear incision on the upper aspect of the scrotum on the right with a 15-blade knife and extended down the subcutaneous tissue with electrocautery.  We used the curved tenotomy scissors to make a subdartos pouch.  Using a mosquito clamp, we were able to go in through the previous internal ring opening, grasped the testis, and then pulled it through in a proper orientation.  Using the hook electrode, we were able to dissect some more of the internal ring tissue to relax the vessels and the vas, so there was no much traction.  Using 2 stay sutures of 4-0 chromic, we tacked the testis to the base of scrotum into the middle portion of the testis.  We then closed the upper aspect of the subdartos pouch with a 4-0 chromic and then closed the subdartos pouch and the skin with subcutaneous 4-0 chromic.  We again evaluated the left side and found again that the vessels were quite short.  The testis was more atrophic, and the vas was virtually nonexistent.  We will go back at a later date to try to bring this down, but it will be quite difficult and has a higher risk for atrophy because of the tissue that is present.  We then removed the ports, closed the fascial defects with figure-of-eight suture of 3-0 Monocryl, closed the infraumbilical incision with two Monocryl stay sutures to close the fascial sheath, and then used 4-0 Rapide to close the skin defects, and then using Dermabond tissue adhesives, we covered all incisions.  At the end of the procedure, the right testis was well descended within the scrotum, and the feeding tube was removed.  The patient had IV Toradol and was in stable condition upon transfer to recovery room.',\n",

       " \"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Hallux abductovalgus deformity with bunion of the left foot.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Hallux abductovalgus deformity with bunion of the left foot.,PROCEDURE PERFORMED: , Scarf bunionectomy procedure of the first metatarsal of the left foot.,ANESTHESIA:,  IV sedation with local.,HISTORY: , This patient is a 55-year-old female who presents to ABCD preoperative holding area after keeping herself n.p.o., since mid night for surgery for her painful left bunion.  The patient has had increasing pain over time and is having difficulty ambulating and wearing shoes.  The patient has failed to conservative treatment and desires surgical correction at this time.  Risks versus benefits of the procedure have been explained in detail by Dr. X, and consent is available on the chart for review.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:,  After an IV established by the Department of Anesthesia, the patient was given preoperatively 600 mg of clindamycin intravenously.  The patient was then taken to the Operating Suite via cart and was placed on the operating table in a supine position and a safety strap was placed across her waist for protection.  Next, a pneumatic ankle tourniquet was applied over her left ankle with copious amounts of Webril for the patient's protection.  After adequate IV sedation was applied, the patient was given a local injection consisting of 17 cc of 4.5 cc 1% lidocaine plain, 4.5 cc of 0.5% Marcaine plain, and 1.0 cc of Solu-Medrol mixture in the standard Mayo block to the left foot.  The foot was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile orthopedic fashion.  The foot was then elevated, the Esmarch was applied and the tourniquet was inflated to 250 mmHg.  The foot was then lowered to the operating field.,A sterile stockinet was reflected and the attention was directed to the first metatarsophalangeal joint of the left foot.  After sufficient anesthesia, using a #10 blade a linear incision was made approximately 5 to 6 cm in length over the first metatarsophalangeal joint dorsally, just near to the extensor hallucis longus tendon.  Then using a fresh #15 blade, this incision was deepened through the skin into the subcutaneous layer after all small traversing veins were ligated and cauterized with electrocautery.  A neurovascular bundle was identified and reflected medially.  Laterally the extensor hallucis longus tendon was identified and protected with retraction as well.  Care was then taken to undermine the medial and lateral margins of the first metatarsophalangeal joint carefully.  The first metatarsophalangeal joint capsule was then identified and using a #15 blade, a linear incision made down to the bone through the joint capsule.  The periosteum was reflected and elevated off of its bone and the metatarsal head as well as the base of the proximal phalanx to a small degree.  Noted was a large hypertrophic bone spur on the dorsal medial aspect of the first metatarsal head as well as some small osteophytes along the medial portion of the proximal phalanx.  Care was then taken to reflect and dissect the periosteum off of the shaft of the first metatarsal proximally into the proximal portion of the metatarsal close to the first metatarsocuneiform joint.  The bone cortex was noted to be intact and in good condition.  Following this, using a sagittal saw with a #138 blade, the attention was directed to the medial hypertrophic bone of the first metatarsal head.  In the sagittal plane with the blade angulated from dorsolateral to proximal medial, the medial eminence of bone was resected.  Plantarly it was noted that the tibial sesamoid groove was intact and the sesamoid apparatus was intact as well.  Following this bone cut, 0.45 K-wire was inserted from medial to lateral through the medial portion of the first metatarsal head directed in the dorsal third of the metatarsal head.  Then using the Reese osteotomy guide, the guide was directed from the distal portion of the metatarsal head proximally to the proximal portion of the first metatarsal.  A second 0.45 K-wire was inserted proximally as well.  Following this, using the sagittal saw with the #138 blade a transverse linear osteotomy cut was made through the first metatarsal from medial to lateral.  After reaching the distal as well as the proximal portions of the bone and ensuring that cortex was cut on both the medial as well as lateral side, the Reese osteotomy guide was removed and the dorsal and plantar incision cuts were made.  This began with the dorsal distal cut, which extended from medial to lateral with the dorsal portion of the blade angled proximally about five degrees through the dorsal third of the distal first metatarsal.  Following this, attention was directed proximally and an incision osteotomy cut through the bone was made, directed medially to laterally with the inferior portion of the blade angled distally to transect the cortex of the bone.  Following this, the distal portion of the osteotomy cut was freely movable and was able to be translocated medially.  The head was then slit medially several millimeters until it was noted to be in good position and no chopping was present in the medullary canal of the bone.  Following this, the bone was stabilized using a 0.45 K-wire distally as well as proximally directed from dorsal to planar direction.  Next using the normal AO manner, the distal cortex was drilled from dorsal to plantar with a 2.0 mm drill bit and then over drilled proximally with the cortex using a 2.7 mm drill bit.  The proximal cortex was then _________ and then the drill hole was measured and it was determined to be 18 mm in length from dorsal to plantar cortex.  Then using 2.7 mm tap, the thread holes were placed and using an 18 x 2.7 mm screw ___________ was achieved and good apposition of the bone and tightness were achieved.  Intramedullary sludge was noted to exit from the osteotomy cut.  Following this, attention was directed proximally and the 0.45 K-wire was removed and the holes were predrilled using a 2.0 mm screw then over-drilled using 2.7 mm screw and counter sucked.  Following this, the holes were measured, found to 20 mm in length and the drill hole was tapped using a 2.7 mm tap.  Following this, a 20 mm full threaded screw was inserted and tightened.  Good intramedullary sludge was noted and compression was achieved.  Attention was then directed to the distal screw where it was once again tightened and found to be in good position with good bite.  Following this, range of motion was performed on the first metatarsophalangeal joint and some lateral deviation of the hallux was noted.  Based on this, a lateral release was performed.  The extensor hallucis longus tendon was identified and was transected medially and a linear incision was placed down using a #15 blade into the first interspace.  The incision was then deepened with sharp and blunt dissection and using a curved hemostat, the transverse as well as the oblique fibers of the abductor hallucis tendon were identified and transected.  Care was taken to perform lateral release around the fibular sesamoid through these suspensory ligaments as well as the transverse metatarsal ligament and the collateral ligament.  Upon completion of this, the hallux was noted to be in a rectus position with good alignment.  The area was then flushed and irrigated with copious amounts of sterile saline.  After this, attention was directed back to the medial capsule and a medial capsulorrhaphy was performed and the capsule was closed using #3-0 Vicryl suture.  Subcutaneous tissues were closed using #3-0 and #4-0 Vicryl sutures to close in layers.  The skin was then reapproximated and closed using #5-0 Monocryl suture.  Following this, the incisions were dressed and bandaged in the normal manner using Owen silk, 4x4s, Kling, and Kerlix as well as Coban dressing.  The tourniquet was then dropped with a total tourniquet time of 99 minutes at 250 mmHg.  The patient followed the procedure and the anesthesia well and vascular status was intact as noted by immediate hyperemia to digits one through five of the left foot.  The patient was then transferred back to the cart and escorted on the cart to the Postanesthesia Care Unit.  Following this, the patient was given prescription for Vicoprofen total #20 to be taken one every six hours as necessary for moderate to severe pain.  The patient was also given prescription for clindamycin to be taken 300 mg four times a day.  The patient was given surgical shoe and was placed in a posterior sling.  The patient was given crutches and instructed to use them for ambulation.  The patient was instructed to keep her foot iced and elevated and to remain nonweightbearing over the weekend.  The patient will follow up with Dr. X on Tuesday morning at 11'o clock in his Livonia office.  The patient was concerned about any possible allergic reaction to medication and was placed on codeine and antibiotics due to that.  The patient has Dr. X's pager and will contact him over this weekend if she has any problems or complaints or return to Emergency Department if any difficulty should arise.  X-rays were taken and the patient was discharged home upon completion of this.\",\n",
       " \"OPERATIVE NOTE:,  The patient was taken to the operating room and placed in the supine position on the operating room table.  The patient was prepped and draped in usual sterile fashion.  An incision was made in the groin crease overlying the internal ring.  This incision was about 1.5 cm in length.  The incision was carried down through the Scarpa's layer to the level of the external oblique.  This was opened along the direction of its fibers and carried down along the external spermatic fascia.  The cremasteric fascia was then incised and the internal spermatic fascia was grasped and pulled free.  A hernia sac was identified and the testicle was located.  Next the internal spermatic fascia was incised and the hernia sac was dissected free inside the internal ring.  This was performed by incising the transversalis fascia circumferentially.  The hernia sac was ligated with a 3-0 silk suture high and divided and was noted to retract into the abdominal cavity.  Care was taken not to injure the testicular vessels.  Next the abnormal attachments of the testicle were dissected free distally with care not to injure any long loop vas and these were divided beneath the testicle for a fair distance.  The lateral attachments tethering the cord vessels were freed from the sidewalls in the retroperitoneum high.  This gave excellent length and very adequate length to bring the testicle down into the anterior superior hemiscrotum.  The testicle was viable.  This was wrapped in a moist sponge.,Next a hemostat was passed down through the inguinal canal down into the scrotum.  A small 1 cm incision was made in the anterior superior scrotal wall.  Dissection was carried down through the dartos layer.  A subdartos pouch was formed with blunt dissection.  The hemostat was then pushed against the tissues and this tissue was divided.  The hemostat was then passed through the incision.  A Crile hemostat was passed back up into the inguinal canal.  The distal attachments of the sac were grasped and pulled down without twisting these structures through the incision.  The neck was then closed with a 4-0 Vicryl suture that was not too tight, but tight enough to prevent retraction of the testicle.  The testicle was then tucked down in its proper orientation into the subdartos pouch and the subcuticular tissue was closed with a running 4-0 chromic and the skin was closed with a running 6-0 subcuticular chromic suture.  Benzoin and a Steri-Strip were placed.  Next the transversus abdominis arch was reapproximated to the iliopubic tract over the top of the cord vessels to tighten up the ring slightly.  This was done with 2 to 3 interrupted 3-0 silk sutures.  The external oblique was then closed with interrupted 3-0 silk suture.  The Scarpa's layer was closed with a running 4-0 chromic and the skin was then closed with a running 4-0 Vicryl intracuticular stitch.  Benzoin and Steri-Strip were applied.  The testicle was in good position in the dependent portion of the hemiscrotum and the patient had a caudal block, was awakened, and was returned to the recovery room in stable condition.\",\n",
       " \"HISTORY:,  The patient was in the intensive care unit setting; he was intubated and sedated.  The patient is a 55-year-old patient, who was admitted secondary to a diagnosis of pancreatitis, developed hypotension and possible sepsis and respiratory as well as renal failure and found to be intubated.  He has been significantly hypotensive during his stay in the intensive care unit and has had minimal urine output.  His creatinine has gone from 2.1 to 4.2 overnight and the patient also developed florid acidosis and hypokalemia.  Nephrology input has been requested for management of acute renal failure and acidosis.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:,1.  Pancreatitis.,2.  Poison ivy.  The patient has recently been on oral steroids.,3.  Hypertension.,MEDICATIONS: , Include Ambien, prednisone, and blood pressure medication, which is not documented in the record at the moment.,INPATIENT MEDICATIONS: , Include Protonix IV, half-normal saline at 125 mL an hour, D5W with 3 ounces of bicarbonate at 150 mL an hour.  The patient was initially on dopamine, which has now been discontinued.  The patient remains on Levophed and Invanz 1 g IV q.24 h.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,  Vitals, emergency room presentation, the blood pressure was 82/45.  His blood pressure in the ICU had dipped down into the 60s systolic, most recent blood pressure is 108/67 and he has been maintained on 100% FiO2.  The patient has had minimal urine output since admission.  HEENT, the patient is intubated at the moment.  Neck examination, no overt lymph node enlargement.  No jugular venous distention.  Lungs examination is benign in terms of crackles.  The patient has some harsh breath sounds secondary to being intubated.  CVS, S1 and S2 are fairly regular at the moment.  There is no pericardial rub.  Abdominal examination, obese, but benign.  Extremity examination reveals no lower extremity edema.  CNS, the patient is intubated and sedated.,LABORATORY DATA: , Blood work, sodium 152, potassium 2.7, bicarbonate 13, BUN 36, and creatinine 4.2.  The patient's BUN and creatinine yesterday were 23 and 2.1 respectively.  H&H of 17.7 and 51.6, white cell count of 8.4 from earlier on this morning.  The patient's liver function tests are all out of whack and his alkaline phosphatase is 226, ALT is 539, CK 1103, INR 1.66, and ammonia level of 55.  Latest ABGs show a pH of 7.04, bicarbonate of 10.7, pCO2 of 40.3, and pO2 of 120.7.,ASSESSMENT:,1.  Acute renal failure, which in all probability is secondary to acute tubular necrosis and sepsis and significant hypotension, but the patient is at the moment on 100% FiO2.  He has been given intravenous fluid at a high rate to replete intravascular volume and to hopefully address his acidosis.  The patient also has significant acidosis and his creatinine has increased from 2.1 to 4.2 overnight.  Given the fact that he would need dialytic support for his electrolyte derangements and for volume control, I would suggest continuous venovenous hemodiafiltration as opposed to conventional hemodialysis as the patient will not be able to tolerate conventional hemodialysis given his hemodynamic instability.,2.  Hypotension, which is significant and is related to his sepsis.  Now the patient has been maintained on Levophed and high rate of intravenous fluid at the moment.,3.  Acidosis, which is again secondary to his renal failure.  The patient was administered intravenous bicarbonate as mentioned above.  Dialytic support in the form of continuous venovenous hemodiafiltration was highly recommended for possible correction of his electrolyte derangements.,4.  Pancreatitis, which has been managed by his gastroenterologist.,5.  Sepsis, the patient is on broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy.,6.  Hypercalcemia.  The patient has been given calcium chloride.  We will need to watch for rebound hypercalcemia.,7.  Hypoalbuminemia.,8.  Hypokalemia, which has been repleted.,RECOMMENDATIONS: , Again include continuation of IV fluid and bicarbonate infusion as well as transfer to the Piedmont Hospital for continuous venovenous hemodiafiltration.\",\n",

Preoperatively patient improved with Diamox.,BRIEF NARRATIVE OF OPERATIVE PROCEDURE: , After satisfactory general endotracheal tube anesthesia was administered, the patient was positioned on the operating table in the supine position with the head rotated towards the left.  The right frontal area and right retroauricular area was shaved and then the head, neck, chest and abdomen were prepped and draped out in the routine manner.  The old scalp incision was opened with a Colorado needle tip and the old catheter was identified as we took the Colorado needle tip over the existing ventricular catheter, right over the sleeve on top of it and when that was entered, the CSF poured out around the ventricular catheter.  The ventricular catheter was then disconnected from the reservoir and endoscopically explored.  We saw it was blocked up proximally.  The catheter was a little adherent and required some freeing up with coagulation and on twisting of the ventricular catheter, I was able to free up the ventricular catheter, and endoscopically inserted a new Bactiseal ventricular catheter.  The catheter went down to the septum and I could see both the right and left lateral ventricles and elected to pass it into the right lateral ventricle.  It irrigated out well.  There was minimal amount of bleeding, but not significant.  The distal catheter system was tested.  There was good distal run off.  Therefore, a linear skin incision was made in the retroauricular area.  Tunneling was performed between the two incisions and a ProGAV valve set to an opening pressure of 10 with a 1-5 shunt assist was brought through the subgaleal tissue, connected to the distal catheter and a flushing reservoir was interposed between the burr hole site ventricular catheter and the ProGAV valve.  All connections were secured with 2-0 Ethibond sutures.  Careful attention was made to make sure that the ProGAV was in the right orientation.  The wounds were irrigated out with Bacitracin, closed in a routine manner using Vicryl for the deep layers and Monocryl for the skin, followed by Mastisol and Steri-Strips.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  He was awakened, extubated and taken to recovery room in satisfactory condition.',\n",

I also reviewed the results of tests, which she had brought with her.,Briefly, she is a 60-year-old woman initially from Ukraine, who had headaches since age 25.  She recalls that in 1996 when her husband died her headaches became more frequent.  They were pulsating.  She was given papaverine, which was successful in reducing the severity of her symptoms.  After six months of taking papaverine, she no longer had any headaches.  In 2004, her headaches returned.  She also noted that she had \"zig-zag lines\" in her vision.  Sometimes she would not see things in her peripheral visions.  She had photophobia and dizziness, which was mostly lightheadedness.  On one occasion she almost had a syncope.  Again she has started taking Russian medications, which did help her.  The dizziness and headaches have become more frequent and now occur on average once to twice per week.  They last two hours since she takes papaverine, which stops the symptoms within 30 minutes.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: ,Her past medical history is significant for injury to her left shoulder, gastroesophageal reflux disorder, diabetes, anxiety, and osteoporosis.,MEDICATIONS:,  Her medications include hydrochlorothiazide, lisinopril, glipizide, metformin, vitamin D, Centrum multivitamin tablets, Actos, lorazepam as needed, Vytorin, and Celexa.,ALLERGIES: , She has no known drug allergies.,FAMILY HISTORY:  ,There is family history of migraine and diabetes in her siblings.,SOCIAL HISTORY: , She drinks alcohol occasionally.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: , Her review of systems was significant for headaches, pain in her left shoulder, sleeping problems and gastroesophageal reflex symptoms.

There was no ataxia.  She was able to walk normally.  Reflexes were 2+ throughout.,She had had a CT scan with constant, which per Dr. X\\'s was unremarkable.  She reports that she had a brain MRI two years ago which was also unremarkable.,IMPRESSION AND PLAN:,  The patient is a delightful 60-year-old chemist from Ukraine who has had episodes of headaches with nausea, photophobia, and dizziness since her 20s.  She has had some immigration problems in recent months and has experienced increased frequency of her migraine symptoms.  Her diagnosis is consistent with vestibular migraine.  I do not see evidence of multiple sclerosis, Ménière\\'s disease, or benign paroxysmal positional vertigo.,I talked to her in detail about the importance of following a migraine diet.  I gave her instructions including a list of foods times, which worsen migraine.  I reviewed this information for more than half the clinic visit.  I would like to start her on amitriptyline at a dose of 10 mg at time.  She will take Motrin at a dose of 800 mg as needed for her severe headaches.,She will make a diary of her migraine symptoms so that we can find any triggering food items, which worsen her symptoms.

This was done under subarachnoid block anesthetic in supine position.,HISTORY AND GROSS FINDINGS: , The patient is a 45-year-old African-American male who suffered acute rupture of his patellar tendon diagnosed both by exam as well as x-ray the evening before surgical intervention.  He did this while playing basketball.,He had a massive deficit at the inferior pole of his patella on exam.  Once opened, he had complete rupture of this patellar tendon as well as a complete rupture of his medial lateral retinaculum.  Minimal cartilaginous pieces were at the patellar tendon.  He had grade II changes to his femoral sulcus as well as grade I-II changes to the undersurface of the patella.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE: , The patient was laid supine on the operative table receiving a subarachnoid block anesthetic by Anesthesia Department.  A thigh high tourniquet was placed.  He is prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.  Limb was elevated, exsanguinated and tourniquet placed at 325 mmHg for approximately 30 to 40 minutes.  Straight incision is carried down through skin and subcutaneous tissue anteriorly.  Hemostasis was controlled via electrocoagulation.  Patellar tendon was isolated along with the patella itself.,A 6 mm Dacron tape x2 was placed with a modified Kessler tendon stitch with a single limb both medially and laterally and a central limb with subsequent shared tape.  The inferior pole was freshened up.  Drill bit was utilized to make holes x3 longitudinally across the patella and the limbs strutted up through the patella with a suture passer.  This was tied over the bony bridge superiorly.  There was excellent reduction of the tendon to the patella.  Interrupted running #1-Vicryl suture was utilized for over silk.  A running #2-0 Vicryl for synovial closure medial and laterally as well as #1-Vicryl medial and lateral retinaculum.  There was excellent repair.  Copious irrigation was carried out.  Tourniquet was dropped and hemostasis controlled via electrocoagulation.  Interrupted #2-0 Vicryl was utilized for subcutaneous fat closure and skin staples were placed through the skin.  Adaptic, 4 x 4s, ABDs, and sterile Webril were placed for compression dressing.  Digits were warm and no brawny pulses present at the end of the case.  The patient's leg was placed in a Don-Joy brace 0 to 20 degrees of flexion.  He will leave this until seen in the office.,Expected surgical prognosis on this patient is fair.\",\n",

Partial plantar fasciotomy.,3.  Posterior subtalar and tibiotalar capsulotomy.,4.  Short leg cast placed.,ANESTHESIA: , Surgery performed under general anesthesia.,TOURNIQUET TIME: , 69 minutes.,The patient in local anesthetic of 20 mL of 0.25% Marcaine plain.,COMPLICATIONS: , No intraoperative complications.,DRAINS:  ,None.,SPECIMENS: , None.,HISTORY AND PHYSICAL: , The patient is a 13-year-old female who had previous bilateral feet correction at 1 year of age.  Since that time, the patient has developed significant calcaneal valgus deformity with significant pain.  Radiographs confirmed collapse of the spinal arch, as well as valgus position of the foot.  Given the patient's symptoms, surgery is recommended for calcaneal osteotomy and Achilles lengthening.  Risks and benefits of surgery were discussed with the mother.  Risks of surgery include risk of anesthesia; infection; bleeding; changes in sensation in most of extremity; hardware failure; need for later hardware removal; possible nonunion; possible failure to correct all the deformity; and need for other surgical procedures.  The patient will need to be strict nonweightbearing for at least 6 weeks and wear a brace for up to 6 months.  All questions were answered and parents agreed to the above surgical plan.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: , The patient was taken to the operating room and placed supine on the operating table.  General anesthesia was then administered.  The patient received Ancef preoperatively.  A bump was placed underneath the left buttock.  A nonsterile tourniquet was placed on the upper aspect of the left thigh.  The extremity was then prepped and draped in a standard surgical fashion.  The patient had a previous incision along the calcaneocuboid lateral part of the foot.  This was marked and extended proximally through the Achilles tendon.  Extremity was wrapped in Esmarch.  Tourniquet inflation was noted to be 250 mmHg.  Decision was then made to protect the sural nerve.  There was one sensory nervous branch that did cross the field though it was subsequently sharply ligated because it was in the way.  Dissection was carried down to Achilles tendon, which was subsequently de-lengthened with the distal half performed down the lateral thigh.  Proximal end was tacked with an 0 Ethibond suture and subsequently repaired end-on-end at length with the heel in neutral.  Dissection was then carried on the lateral border of the foot with identification of the peroneal longus and valgus tendons, which were removed from the sheath and retracted dorsally.  At this time, we also noted that calcaneocuboid joint appeared to be fused.  The area between the anterior and middle facets were plicated on fluoroscopy for planned osteotomy.  This was performed with a saw.  After a partial plantar fasciotomy was performed, this was released off an abductor digiti minimi.  The osteotomy was completed with an osteotome and distracted with the lamina spreader.  A tricortical allograft was then shaped and subsequently impacted into this area.  Final positioning was checked with multiple views of fluoroscopy.  It was subsequently fixed using a 0.94 K-wire and drilled from the heel anteriorly.  A pin was subsequently bent and cut short at the level of the skin.  The wound was then irrigated with normal saline.  The Achilles was repaired with this tie.  Please note during the case, it was noted the patient had continued significant stiffness despite the Achilles lengthening.  A posterior capsulotomy of the tibiotalar and subtalar joints were performed with increased 10 degrees of dorsiflexion.  Wound was then closed using #2-0 Vicryl and #4-0 Monocryl.  The surgical field was irrigated with 0.25% Marcaine and subsequently injected with more Marcaine at the end of the case.  The wound was clean and dry and dressed with Steri-Strips and Xeroform.  Skin was dressed with Xeroform and 4 x 4's.  Everything was wrapped with 4 x 4's in sterile Webril.  The tourniquet was released after 69 minutes.  A short-leg cast was then placed with good return of capillary refill to his toes.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and was subsequently taken to the recovery room in stable condition.,POSTOPERATIVE PLAN: , The patient will be hospitalized overnight for elevation, ice packs, neurovascular checks, and pain control.  The patient to be strict nonweightbearing.  We will arrange for her to get a wheelchair.  The patient will then follow up in about 10 to 14 days for a cast check, as well as pain control.  The patient will need an AFO script at that time.  Intraoperative findings are relayed to the parents.\",\n",

A mass in the left upper lobe was biopsied with fine-needle aspiration and shown to be a primary non-small-cell carcinoma of the lung.  PET scan was, otherwise, negative for spread and resection was advised.  All the risk and benefits were fully explained to the patient and she elected to proceed as planned.  She was transferred to rehab for couple of weeks to buildup strength before the surgery.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:,  In the operating room under anesthesia, she was prepped and draped suitably.  Dr. B was the staff anesthesiologist.  Left muscle sparing mini thoracotomy was made.  The serratus and latissimus muscles were not cut but moved out to the way.  Access to the chest was obtained through the fifth intercostal space.  Two Tuffier retractors of right angles provided adequate exposure.,The inferior pulmonary ligament was not dissected free and lymph nodes from the station 9 were now sent for pathology.  The parietal pleural reflexion around the hilum was now circumcised, and lymph nodes were taken from station 8 and station 5.,The branches of the pulmonary artery to the upper lobe were now individually stapled with a 30/2.5 staple gun or/and the smaller one were ligated with 2-0 silk.  The left superior pulmonary vein was transected using a TA30/2.5 staple gun, and the fissure was completed using firings of an endo-GIA 60/4.8 staple gun.  Finally, the left upper lobe bronchus was transected using a TA30/4.8 staple gun.  Please note, that this patient had been somewhat unusual variant of a small bronchus that was coming out posterior to the main trunk of the pulmonary artery and supplying a small section of the posterior portion of the left upper lobe.,The specimen was delivered and sent to pathology.

She was counseled to undergo laparoscopic staging.,FINDINGS:,  During the laparoscopy, the uterus was noted to be upper limits of normal size, with a normal-appearing right fallopian tubes and ovaries.  No ascites was present.  On assessment of the upper abdomen, the stomach, diaphragm, liver, gallbladder, spleen, omentum, and peritoneal surfaces of the bowel, were all unremarkable in appearance.,PROCEDURE: , The patient was brought into the operating room with an intravenous line in placed, and anesthetic was administered.  She was placed in a low anterior lithotomy position using Allen stirrups.  The vaginal portion of the procedure included placement of a ZUMI uterine manipulator with a Koh colpotomy ring and a vaginal occluder balloon.,The laparoscopic port sites were anesthetized with intradermal injection of 0.25% Marcaine.  There were five ports placed, including a 3-mm left subcostal port, a 10-mm umbilical port, a 10-mm suprapubic port, and 5-mm right and left lower quadrant ports.  The Veress needle was placed through a small incision at the base of the umbilicus, and a pneumoperitoneum was insufflated without difficulty.  The 3-mm port was then placed in the left subcostal position without difficulty, and a 3-mm scope was placed.  There were no adhesions underlying the previous vertical midline scar.  The 10-mm port was placed in the umbilicus, and the laparoscope was inserted.  Remaining ports were placed under direct laparoscopic guidance.  Washings were obtained from the pelvis, and the abdomen was explored with the laparoscope, with findings as noted.,Attention was then turned to lymphadenectomy.  An incision in the retroperitoneum was made over the right common iliac artery, extending up the aorta to the retroperitoneal duodenum.  The lymph node bundle was elevated from the aorta and the anterior vena cava until the retroperitoneal duodenum had been reached.  Pedicles were sealed and divided with bipolar cutting forceps.  Excellent hemostasis was noted.  Boundaries of dissection included the ureters laterally, common ileac arteries at uterine crossover inferiorly, and the retroperitoneal duodenum superiorly with careful preservation of the inferior mesenteric artery.  Right and left pelvic retroperitoneal spaces were then opened by incising lateral and parallel to the infundibulopelvic ligament with the bipolar cutting forceps.  The retroperitoneal space was then opened and the lymph nodes were dissected, with boundaries of dissection being the bifurcation of the common iliac artery superiorly, psoas muscle laterally, inguinal ligament inferiorly, and the anterior division of the hypogastric artery medially.  The posterior boundary was the obturator nerve, which was carefully identified and preserved bilaterally.  The left common iliac lymph node was elevated and removed using the same technique.,Attention was then turned to the laparoscopic hysterectomy.  The right infundibulopelvic ligament was divided using the bipolar cutting forceps.  The mesovarium was skeletonized.  A bladder flap was mobilized by dividing the round ligaments using the bipolar cutting forceps, and the peritoneum on the vesicouterine fold was incised to mobilize the bladder.  Once the Koh colpotomy ring was skeletonized and in position, the uterine arteries were sealed using the bipolar forceps at the level of the colpotomy ring.  The vagina was transected using a monopolar hook (or bipolar spatula), resulting in separation of the uterus and attached tubes and ovaries.  The uterus, tubes, and ovaries were then delivered through the vagina, and the pneumo-occluder balloon was reinserted to maintain pneumoperitoneum.  The vaginal vault was closed with interrupted figure-of-eight stitches of 0-Vicryl using the Endo-Stitch device.  The abdomen was irrigated, and excellent hemostasis was noted.,The insufflation pressure was reduced, and no evidence of bleeding was seen.  The suprapubic port was then removed, and the fascia was closed with a Carter-Thomason device and 0-Vicryl suture.  The remaining ports were removed under direct laparoscopic guidance, and the pneumoperitoneum was released.  The umbilical port was removed using laparoscopic guidance.  The umbilical fascia was closed with an interrupted figure-of-eight stitch using 2-0 Vicryl.  The skin was closed with interrupted subcuticular stitches using 4-0 Monocryl suture.  The final sponge, needle, and instrument counts were correct at the completion of the procedure.  The patient was awakened and taken to the post anesthesia care unit in stable condition.',\n",
       " 'PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS AND INDICATIONS:,  Acute non-ST-elevation MI.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS AND SUMMARY:,  The patient presented with an acute non-ST-elevation MI.  Despite medical therapy, she continued to have intermittent angina.  Angiography demonstrated the severe LAD as the culprit lesion.  This was treated as noted above with angioplasty alone as the stent could not be safely advanced.  She has residual lesions of 75% in the proximal right coronary and 60% proximal circumflex, and the other residual LAD lesions as noted above.  She will be continued on her medical therapy.  At age 90, she is not a good candidate for aortic valve replacement and coronary bypass grafting.,PROCEDURE PERFORMED: , Selective coronary angiography, coronary angioplasty.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:,  After informed consent was obtained, the patient was taken to the cath lab, placed on the table in the supine position.  The area of the right femoral artery was prepped and draped in a sterile fashion.  Using the percutaneous technique, a 6-French sheath was placed in the right femoral artery under fluoroscopic guidance.  With the guidewire in place, a 5-French JL-4 catheter was used to selectively angiogram the left coronary system.  The catheter was removed.  The sheath flushed.  The 5-French 3DRC catheter was then used to selectively angiogram the right coronary artery.  The cath removed, the sheath flushed.,It was decided that intervention was needed in the severe lesions in the LAD, which appeared to be the culprit lesions for the non-ST elevation-MI.  The patient was given a bolus of heparin and an ACT of approximately 50 seconds was obtained, we rebolused and the ACT was slightly lower.  We repeated the level and it was slightly higher.  We administered 500 more units of heparin and then proceeded with an ACT of approximately 270 seconds prior to the 500 units of heparin IV.  Additionally, the patient had been given 300 mg of Plavix orally during the procedure and Integrilin IV bolus and then maintenance drip was started.,A 6-French CLS 3.5 left coronary guide catheter was used to cannulate the left main and HEW guidewire was positioned in the distal LAD and another HEW guidewire in the relatively large third diagonal.  An Apex 2.5 x 15 mm balloon was positioned in the distal portion of the mid LAD stenosis and inflated to 6 atmospheres for 15 seconds and then deflated.  Angiography was then performed, demonstrated marked improvement in the stenosis and this image was used for sizing the last of the needed stent.  The balloon was pulled more proximally and then inflated again at 6 atmospheres for approximately 20 seconds, with the proximal end of the balloon positioned distal to the origin of the third diagonal so as to not compromise the ostium.  The balloon was inflated and removed, repeat angiography performed.  We attempted to advance a Driver 2.5 x 24 mm bare metal stent, but I could not advance it beyond the proximal LAD, where there was significant calcification.  The stent was removed.  Attempts to advance the same 2.5 x 15 mm Apex balloon that was previously used were unsuccessful.  It was removed, a new Apex 2.5 x 15 mm balloon was then positioned in the proximal LAD and inflated to 6 atmospheres for 15 seconds and then deflated and advanced slightly with the distal tip of the balloon proximal to the third diagonal ostium and it was inflated to 6 atmospheres for 15 seconds and then deflated and removed.  Repeat angiography demonstrated no evidence of dissection.  One more attempt was made to advance the Driver 2.5 x 24 mm bare metal stent, but again I could not advance it beyond the calcified plaque in the proximal LAD and this was despite the presence of the buddy wire in the diagonal.  I felt that further attempts in this calcified vessel in a 90-year-old with severe aortic stenosis and severe aortic insufficiency would likely result in complications of dissection, so the stent was removed.  The guidewires and guide cath were removed.  The sheath flushed and sutured into position.  The patient moved to ICU in stable condition with no chest discomfort at all.,CONTRAST: , Isovue-370, 120 mL.,FLUORO TIME: , 9.4 minutes.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: , 30 mL.,HEMODYNAMICS:,  Aorta 185/54.,Left ventriculography was not performed.  I did not make an attempt to cross this severely stenotic aortic valve.,The left main is a large vessel, giving rise to LAD and circumflex vessels.  The left main has no significant disease other than calcification in the walls.,The LAD is a moderate-to-large vessel, giving rise to small diagonals and then a moderate-to-large third diagonal, and then a small fourth diagonal.  The LAD has significant calcification proximally.  There is a 50% stenosis between the first and second diagonals that we treated with angioplasty alone in an attempt to be able to advance the stent.  This resulted in a 30% residual, mostly eccentric calcified plaque.  Following this, there was a 50% stenosis in the LAD just after the takeoff of the third diagonal.  This was not ballooned.  Beyond this is an 80% stenosis prior to the fourth diagonal and then a 99% stenosis after the fourth diagonal.  These 2 lesions were dilated with 10% residual prior to the fourth diagonal and 25% residual distal to the fourth diagonal.  As noted above, this area was not stented because I could not safely advance the stent.  Note, there was also a 50% stenosis at the origin of the moderate-to-large third diagonal that did not change with angioplasty.,The circumflex is a large, nondominant vessel consisting of a large obtuse marginal with multiple branches.  The proximal circumflex has an eccentric 60% stenosis prior to the takeoff of the obtuse marginal.  The remainder of the vessel was without significant disease.,The right coronary was a large, dominant vessel giving rise to a large posterior descending artery and small-to-moderate first posterolateral, small second posterolateral, and a small-to-moderate third posterolateral branch.  The right coronary has an eccentric smooth 75% stenosis beginning about a centimeter after the origin of the vessel and prior to the acute marginal branch.  The remainder of the right coronary and its branches were without significant disease.',\n",

The symptoms were unrelieved by conservative modalities.  The symptoms were interfering with all aspects of daily living and inability to perform any significant work endeavors.  She is understanding the risks, benefits, potential complications, as well as all treatment alternatives.  She wished to proceed with the aforementioned surgery due to her persistent symptoms.  Informed consent was obtained.,OPERATIVE TECHNIQUE: , The patient was taken to OR room #5 where she was given general anesthetic by the Department of Anesthesia.  She was subsequently placed on the Jackson spinal table with the Wilson attachment in the prone position.  Palpation did reveal the iliac crest and suspected L5-S1 interspace.  Thereafter the lumbar spine was serially prepped and draped.  A midline incision was carried over the spinal process of L5 to S1.  Skin and subcutaneous tissue were divided sharply.  Electrocautery provided hemostasis.  Electrocautery was then utilized to dissect through the subcutaneous tissues to the lumbar fascia.  Lumbar fascia was identified and the decussation of fibers was identified at the L5-S1 interspace.  On the left side, superior aspect dissection was carried out with the Cobb elevator and electrocautery.  This revealed the interspace of suspect level of L5-S1 on the left.  A Kocher clamp was placed between the spinous processes of the suspect level of L5-S1.  X-ray did confirm the L5-S1 interval.  Angled curet was utilized to detach the ligamentum flavum from its bony attachments at the superior edge of S1 lamina and the inferior edge of the L5 lamina.  Meticulous dissection was undertaken and the ligamentum flavum was removed.  Laminotomy was created with Kerrison rongeur, both proximally and distally.  The microscope was positioned and the dura was inspected.  A blunt Penfield elevator was then utilized to dissect and identify the L5-S1 nerve root on the left.  It was noted to be tented over a disc extrusion.  The nerve root was protected and medialized.  It was retracted with a nerve root retractor.  This did reveal a subligamentous disc herniation at approximately the L5-S1 disc space and neuroforaminal area.  A #15 Bard-Parker blade was utilized to create an annulotomy.  Medially, disc material was extruding through this annulotomy.  Two tier rongeur was then utilized to grasp the disc material and the disc was removed from the interspace.  Additional disc material was then removed, both to the right and left of the annulotomy.  Up and downbiting pituitary rongeurs were utilized to remove any other loose disc pieces.  Once this was completed, the wound was copiously irrigated with antibiotic solution and suctioned dry.  The Penfield elevator was placed in the disc space of L5-S1 and a crosstable x-ray did confirm this level.  Nerve root was again expected exhibiting the foramina.  A foraminotomy was created with a Kerrison rongeur.  Once this was created, the nerve root was again inspected and deemed free of tension.  It was mobile within the neural foramina.  The wound was again copiously irrigated with antibiotic solution and suctioned dry.  A free fat graft was then harvested from the subcutaneous tissues and placed over the exposed dura.  Lumbar fascia was then approximated with #1 Vicryl interrupted fashion, subcutaneous tissue with #2-0 Vicryl interrupted fashion, and #4-0 undyed Vicryl was utilized to approximate the skin.  Compression dressing was applied.  The patient was turned, awoken, and noted to be moving all four extremities without apparent deficits.  She was taken to the recovery room in apparent satisfactory condition.  Expected surgical prognosis remains guarded due to her ongoing pain syndrome that has been requiring significant narcotic medications.',\n",

The patient has a history of gradual onset of a painful bunion over the past several years.  She has tried conservative methods such as wide shoes, accommodative padding on an outpatient basis with Dr. X all of which have provided inadequate relief.  At this time, she desires attempted surgical correction.  The risks versus benefits of the procedure have been discussed with the patient in detail by Dr. X and the consent is available on the chart for review.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , After IV was established by the Department of Anesthesia, the patient was taken to the operating room via cart and placed on the operative table in supine position and a safety strap was placed across her waist for her protection.  Copious amounts of Webril were applied about the right ankle and a pneumatic ankle tourniquet was placed over the Webril.,After adequate IV sedation was administered by the Department of Anesthesia, a total of 15 cc of 1:1 mixture of 0.5% Marcaine plain and 1% Lidocaine plain was injected into the foot in a standard Mayo block fashion.  The foot was elevated off the table.  Esmarch bandages were used to exsanguinate the right foot.  The pneumatic ankle tourniquet was elevated to 250 mmHg.  The foot was lowered in the operative field and the sterile stockinet was reflected.  A sterile Betadine was wiped away with a wet and dry sponge and one toothpick was used to test anesthesia, which was found to be adequate.  Attention was directed to the first metatarsophalangeal joint, which was found to be contracted, laterally deviated, and had decreased range of motion.  A #10 blade was used to make a 4 cm dorsolinear incision.  A #15 blade was used to deepen the incision through the subcutaneous layer.  All superficial subcutaneous vessels were ligated with electrocautery.  Next, a linear capsular incision was made down the bone with a #15 blade.  The capsule was elevated medially and laterally off the metatarsal head and the metatarsal head was delivered into the wound.  A hypertrophic medial eminence was resected with a sagittal saw taking care not to strike the head.  The medial plantar aspect of the metatarsal head had some erosive changes and eburnation.  Next, a 0.45 inch Kirschner wire was placed with some access guide slightly plantar flexing the metatarsal taking care not to shorten it.  A sagittal saw was used to make a long-arm Austin osteotomy in the usual fashion.  Standard lateral release was also performed as well as a lateral capsulotomy freeing the fibular sesamoid complex.,The capital head was shifted laterally and impacted on the residual metatarsal head.  Nice correction was achieved and excellent bone to bone contact was achieved.  The bone stock was slightly decreased, but adequate.  Next, a 0.45 inch Kirschner wire was used to temporarily fixate the metatarsal capital fragment.  A 2.7 x 18 mm Synthes cortical screw was thrown using standard AO technique.  Excellent rigid fixation was achieved.  A second 2.0 x 80 mm Synthes fully threaded cortical screw was also thrown using standard AO technique at the proximal aspect of the metatarsal head.  Again, an excellent rigid fixation was obtained and the screws were tight.  The temporary fixation was removed.  A medial overhanging bone was resected with a sagittal saw.  The foot was loaded and the hallux was found to have an interphalangeus deformity present.,A sagittal saw was used to make a proximal cut in approximately 1 cm dorsal to the base of the proximal phalanx, leaving a lateral intact cortical hinge.  A distal cut parallel with the nail base was performed and a standard proximal Akin osteotomy was done.,After the wedge bone was removed, the saw blade was reinserted and used to tether the osteotomy with counter-pressure used to close down the osteotomy.  A #15 drill blade was used to drill two converging holes on the medial aspect of the bone.  A #28 gauge monofilament wire was inserted loop to loop and pulled through the bone.  The monofilament wire was twisted down and tapped into the distal drill hole.  The foot was loaded again and the toe had an excellent cosmetic straight appearance and the range of motion of the first metatarsophalangeal joint was then improved.  Next, reciprocating rasps were used to smooth all bony surfaces.  Copious amounts of sterile saline was used to flush the joint.  Next, a #3-0 Vicryl was used to reapproximate the capsular periosteal tissue layer.  Next, #4-0 Vicryl was used to close the subcutaneous layer.  #5-0 Vicryl was used to the close the subcuticular layer in a running fashion.  Next, 1 cc of dexamethasone phosphate was then instilled in the joint.  The Steri-Strips were applied followed by standard postoperative dressing consisting of Owen silk, 4 x 4s, Kling, Kerlix, and Coban.  The pneumatic ankle tourniquet was released and immediate hyperemic flush was noted to the digits.  The patient tolerated the above anesthesia and procedure without complications.  She was transported via cart to the Postanesthesia Care Unit with vital signs stable and vascular status intact to the right foot.  She is to be partial weightbearing with crutches.  She is to follow with Dr. X.  She was given emergency contact numbers and instructions to call if problems arise.  She was given prescription for Vicodin ES #25 one p.o. q.4-6h. p.r.n. pain and Naprosyn one p.o. b.i.d.  500 mg.  She was discharged in stable condition.',\n",

The patient was taken to cardiac catheterization suite where the right femoral region was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  1% lidocaine solution was used to infiltrate the skin overlying the right femoral artery.  Once adequate anesthesia had been obtained, a thin-walled #18 gauge Argon needle was used to cannulate the right femoral artery.  A steel guidewire was inserted through the needle into the vascular lumen without resistance.  A small nick was then made in the skin.  The pressure was held.  The needle was removed over the guidewire.  Next, a Judkins left #4 catheter was advanced to the level of the ascending aorta under direct fluoroscopic visualization with the use of a guidewire.  The guidewire was removed.  The catheter was connected to the manifold and flushed.  The ostium of the left main coronary artery was engaged.  Using hand injections of nonionic contrast material, the left coronary system was evaluated in several different views.  Once an adequate study had been performed, the catheter was removed from the ostium of the left main coronary artery and a steel guidewire was inserted through the catheter.  The catheter was then removed over the guidewire.,Next, a Judkins right #4 catheter was advanced to the level of the ascending aorta under direct fluoroscopic visualization with the use of a guidewire.  The guidewire was removed.  The catheter was connected to manifold and flushed.  The catheter did slip into the left ventricle.  During the rotation, the LVEDP was then measured.  The ostium of the right coronary artery was then engaged.  Using hand injections of nonionic contrast material, the right coronary system was evaluated in several different views.  Once adequate study has been performed, the catheter was then removed.  The sheath was lastly flushed for the final time.,FINDINGS:,LEFT MAIN CORONARY ARTERY: , The left main coronary artery is a moderate caliber vessel, which bifurcates into the left anterior descending and circumflex arteries.  There is no evidence of any hemodynamically significant stenosis.,LEFT ANTERIOR DESCENDING ARTERY: , The LAD is a moderate caliber vessel, which is subtotaled in its mid portion for approximately 1.5 cm to 1 cm with subsequent TIMI-I flow distally.  The distal portion was diffusely diseased.  The proximal portion otherwise shows minor luminal irregularities.  The first diagonal branch demonstrated minor luminal irregularities throughout.,CIRCUMFLEX ARTERY:  ,The circumflex is a moderate caliber vessel, which traverses through the atrioventricular groove.  There is a 60% proximal lesion and a 90% mid lesion prior to the takeoff of the first obtuse marginal branch.  The first obtuse marginal branch demonstrates minor luminal irregularities throughout.,RIGHT CORONARY ARTERY: , The RCA is a moderate caliber vessel, which demonstrates a 90% mid stenotic lesion.  The dominant coronary artery gives off the posterior descending artery and posterolateral artery.  The left ventricular end-diastolic pressure was approximately 22 mmHg.  It should be noted that during injection of the contrast agent that there was ST elevation in the inferior leads, which resolved after the injection was complete.,IMPRESSION:,1.

       " 'PROCEDURE: , Left heart catheterization, left and right coronary angiography, left ventricular angiography, and intercoronary stenting of the right coronary artery.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:  ,The patient was brought to the Catheterization Laboratory.  After informed consent, he was medicated with Versed and fentanyl.  The right groin was prepped and draped, and infiltrated with 2% Xylocaine.  Percutaneously, #6-French arterial sheath was placed.  Selective native left and right coronary angiography was performed followed by left ventricular angiography.  The patient had a totally occluded right coronary.  We initially started with a JR4 guide.  We were able to a sport wire through the total occlusion and saw a very tight stenosis.  We were able to get a 30 x 13 mm power saver balloon into the stenosis and dilated.  We then attempted to put a 30 x 12 mm stent across the stenosis, but we had very little guide support, the guide kept coming out.  We then switched to an AL1 guide and that too did not enable us to get anything to cross this lesion.  We finally had to go an AL2 guide, we were concerned that this could cause some proximal dissection.  That guided seated, we did have initial difficulty getting the wire back across the stenosis, and we did see a little staining suggesting we did have some tearing from the guide tip.  The surgeons were put on notice in case we could not get this vessel open, but we were able to re-cross with a sport wire.  We then re-dilated the area of stenosis and with good guide support, we were able to get a 30 x 23 mm Vision stent, where the lesion was and post-dilated it to 18 atmospheres.  Routine angiography did show that the distal posterolateral branch seems to be occluded, whether this was from distal wire dissection or distal thrombosis was unclear, but we were able to re-wire that area and get a 25 x12 Vision balloon and dilate the area and re-establish flow to the small segment.  We then came back because of the residual dissection proximal to the first stent and put a 30 x15 mm Vision stent at 18 atmospheres.  Final angiography showed resolution of the dissection.  We could see a little staining extrinsic to the stent.  No perforation and excellent flow.  During the intervention, we did give a bolus and drip of Angiomax.  At the end of the procedure, we stopped the Angiomax and gave 600 mg of Plavix.  We did a right femoral angiogram; however, the Angio-Seal plug could not take, so we used manual pressure and a Femostop.  We transported the patient to his room in stable condition.,ANGIOGRAPHIC DATA:,  Left main coronary is normal.  Left anterior descending artery has a fair amount of wall disease proximally about 50 to 60% stenosis of the LAD before it bifurcates into diagonal.  The diagonal does appear to have about 50% osteal stenosis.  There is a lot of plaquing further down the diagonal, but good flow.  The rest of the LAD looked good pass the proximal 60% stenosis and after the diagonal branch.  Circumflex artery was nondominant vessel, consisting of an obtuse marginal vessel.  The first obtuse marginal had a long 50% narrowing and then the AV groove branch was free of any disease.  Some mild collaterals to the right were seen.  Right coronary angiography revealed a total occlusion of the right coronary, just about 0.5 cm after its origin.  After we got a wire across the area of occlusion, we could see some thrombosis and a 99% stenosis just at the curve.  Following the balloon angioplasty, we established good flow down the distal vessel.  We still had about residual 70% stenosis.  When we had to go back with the AL2 guide, we could see a little bit of staining in the proximal portion of the vessel that we did not notice previously and we felt that the tip of the guide caused a little bit of intimal dissection.  We re-dilated and then deployed.  Repeat angiography now did show some hang up off dye distally.  We never did have the wire that far down, so this was probably felt to be due to distal embolization of some thrombus.  After deploying the stent, we had total resolution of the original lesion.  We then directed our attention to the posterolateral branch, which the remainder of the vessel was patent giving off a large PDA.  The posterolateral branch appeared to be occluded in its mid portion.  We got a wire through and dilated this.  We then came back and put a second stent in the proximal area of the right coronary proximal and abutting to the previous stent.  Repeat angiography now showed no significant dissection, a little bit of contrast getting extrinsic to the stent probably in a little subintimal pouch, but this was excluded by the stent.  There were no filling defects in the stent and excellent flow.  The distal posterolateral branch did open up, although it was little under-filled and there may have been some mild residual disease there.,IMPRESSION: , Atherosclerotic heart disease with total occlusion of right coronary, successfully stented to zero residual with repair of a small proximal dissection.  Minor distal disease of the posterolateral branch and 60% proximal left anterior descending coronary artery stenosis and 50% diagonal stenosis along with 50% stenosis of the first obtuse marginal branch.',\n",

The patient is a product of a term pregnancy that was uncomplicated and no perinatal issues are raised.  Parents; however, did note the patient to be quite dusky since the time of her birth; however, were reassured by the pediatrician that this was normal.  The patient demonstrates good interval weight gain and only today presented to an outside hospital with significant duskiness, some irritability, and rapid heart rate.  Parents do state that she does appear to breathe rapidly, tires somewhat with the feeding with increased respiratory effort and diaphoresis.  The patient is exclusively breast fed and feeding approximately 2 hours.  Upon arrival at Children's Hospital, the patient was found to be in a narrow complex tachycardia with the rate in excess of 258 beats per minute with a successful cardioversion to sinus rhythm with adenosine.  The electrocardiogram following the cardioversion had demonstrated normal sinus rhythm with a right atrial enlargement, northwest axis, and poor R-wave progression, possible right ventricular hypertrophy.,FAMILY HISTORY:,  Family history is remarkable for an older sibling found to have a small ventricular septal defect that is spontaneously closed.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: , A complete review of systems including neurologic, respiratory, gastrointestinal, genitourinary are otherwise negative.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,GENERAL:  Physical examination that showed a sedated, acyanotic infant who is in no acute distress.,VITAL SIGNS:  Heart rate of 170, respiratory rate of 65, saturation, it is nasal cannula oxygen of 74% with a prostaglandin infusion at 0.5 mcg/kg/minute.,HEENT:  Normocephalic with no bruit detected.

There is normal S1, single loud S2, and a 2/6 continuous shunt type of murmur could be appreciated at the left upper sternal border.,ABDOMEN:  Soft.  Liver edge is palpated at 3 cm below the costal margin and no masses or bruits detected.,X-RAYS:,  Review of the chest x-ray demonstrated a normal situs, normal heart size, and adequate pulmonary vascular markings.  There is a prominent thymus.  An echocardiogram demonstrated significant cyanotic congenital heart disease consisting of normal situs, a left superior vena cava draining into the left atrium, a criss-cross heart with atrioventricular discordance of the right atrium draining through the mitral valve into the left-sided morphologic left ventricle.  The left atrium drained through the tricuspid valve into a right-sided morphologic right ventricle.  There is a large inlet ventricular septal defect as pulmonary atresia.  The aorta was malopposed arising from the right ventricle in the anterior position with the left aortic arch.  There was a small vertical ductus as a sole source of pulmonary artery blood flow.  The central pulmonary arteries appeared confluent although small measuring 3 mm in the diameter.  Biventricular function is well maintained.,FINAL IMPRESSION: , The patient has significant cyanotic congenital heart disease physiologically with a single ventricle physiology and ductal-dependent pulmonary blood flow and the incidental supraventricular tachycardia now in the sinus rhythm with adequate ventricular function.  The saturations are now also adequate on prostaglandin E1.,RECOMMENDATION: , My recommendation is that the patient be continued on prostaglandin E1.  The patient's case was presented to the cardiothoracic surgical consultant, Dr. X.  The patient will require further echocardiographic study in the morning to further delineate the pulmonary artery anatomy and confirm the central confluence.  A consideration will be made for diagnostic cardiac catheterization to fully delineate the pulmonary artery anatomy prior to surgical intervention.  The patient will require some form of systemic to pulmonary shunt, modified pelvic shunt or central shunt as a durable source of pulmonary blood flow.  Further surgical repair was continued on the size and location of the ventricular septal defect over the course of the time for consideration of possible Rastelli procedure.  The current recommendation is for proceeding with a central shunt and followed then by bilateral bidirectional Glenn shunt with then consideration for a septation when the patient is 1 to 2 years of age.  These findings and recommendations were reviewed with the parents via a Spanish interpreter.\",\n",

The patient was seen in the emergency room.  The patient had a complete fracture of both bones with shortening bayonet apposition.  Treatment options were offered to the family including casting versus closed reduction and pinning.  The parents opted for the latter.  Risks and benefits of surgery were discussed.  Risks of surgery included risk of anesthesia, infection, bleeding, changes in sensation and motion of the extremity, hardware failure, and need for later hardware removal, cast tightness.  All questions were answered, and the parents agreed to the above plan.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , The patient was taken to the operating room and placed supine on the operating room table.  General anesthesia was then administered.  The patient received Ancef preoperatively.  The right upper extremity was then prepped and draped in standard surgical fashion.  A small incision was made at the tip of the olecranon.  Initially, a 1.11 guidewire was placed, but this was noted to be too wide for this canal.  This was changed for a 0.79 K-wire.  This was driven up to the fracture site.  The fracture was manually reduced and then the K-wire passed through the distal segment.  This demonstrated adequate fixation and reduction of both bones.  The pin was then cut short.  The fracture site and pin site was infiltrated with 0.25% Marcaine.  The incision was closed using 4-0 Monocryl.  The wounds were cleaned and dried.  Dressed with Xeroform, 4 x 4.  The patient was then placed in a well-moulded long-arm cast.  He tolerated the procedure well.  He was subsequently taken to Recovery in stable condition.,POSTOPERATIVE PLAN: , The patient will be maintain current pin, and long-arm cast for 4 weeks at which time he will return for cast removal.  X-rays of the right forearm will be taken.  The patient may need additional mobilization time.  Once the fracture has healed, we will take the pin out, usually at the earliest 3 to 4 months.

The patient has a history of chronic osteomyelitis and non-healing ulceration to the left hallux of almost 10 years\\' duration.  He has failed outpatient antibiotic therapy and conservative methods.  At this time, he desires to attempt surgical correction.  The patient is not interested in a hallux amputation at this time; however, he is consenting to removal of infected bone.  He was counseled preoperatively about the strong probability of the hallux being a \"floppy tail\" after the surgery and accepts the fact.  The risks versus benefits of the procedure were discussed with the patient in detail by Dr. X and the consent is available on the chart for review.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:  ,The patient\\'s wound was debrided with a #15 blade and down to good healthy tissue preoperatively.  The wound was on the planar medial, distal and dorsal medial.  The wound\\'s bases were fibrous.  They did not break the bone at this point.  They were each approximately 0.5 cm in diameter.  After IV was established by the Department of Anesthesia, the patient was taken to the operating room and placed on the operating table in supine position with safety straps placed across his waist for his protection.,Due to the patient\\'s history of diabetes and marked calcifications on x-ray, a pneumatic ankle tourniquet was not applied.  Next, a total of 3 cc of a 1:1 mixture of 0.5% Marcaine plain and 1% lidocaine plain was used to infiltrate the left hallux and perform a digital block.  Next, the foot was prepped and draped in the usual aseptic fashion.  It was lowered in the operative field and attention was directed to the left hallux after the sterile stockinet was reflected.  Next, a #10 blade was used to make a linear incision approximately 3.5 cm in length along the dorsal aspect of the hallux from the base to just proximal to the eponychium.  Next, the incision was deepened through the subcutaneous tissue.  A heavy amount of bleeding was encountered.  Therefore, a Penrose drain was applied at the tourniquet, which failed.  Next, an Esmarch bandage was used to exsanguinate the distal toes and forefoot and was left in the forefoot to achieve hemostasis.  Any small veins crossing throughout the subcutaneous layer were ligated via electrocautery.  Next, the medial and lateral margins of the incision were under marked with a sharp dissection down to the level of the long extension tendon.  The long extensor tendon was thickened and overall exhibited signs of hypertrophy.  The transverse incision through the long extensor tendon was made with a #15 blade.  Immediately upon entering the joint, yellow discolored fluid was drained from the interphalangeal joint.  Next, the extensor tendon was peeled dorsally and distally off the bone.  Immediately the head of the proximal phalanx was found to be lytic, disease, friable, crumbly, and there were free fragments of the medial aspect of the bone, the head of the proximal phalanx.  This bone was removed with a sharp dissection.  Next, after adequate exposure was obtained and the collateral ligaments were released off the head of proximal phalanx, a sagittal saw was used to resect the approximately one-half of the proximal phalanx.  This was passed off as the infected bone specimen for microbiology and pathology.  Next, the base of the distal phalanx was exposed with sharp dissection and a rongeur was used to remove soft crumbly diseased medial and plantar aspect at the base of distal phalanx.  Next, there was diseased soft tissue envelope around the bone, which was also resected to good healthy tissue margins.  The pulse lavage was used to flush the wound with 1000 cc of gentamicin-impregnated saline.  Next, cleaned instruments were used to take a proximal section of proximal phalanx to label a clean margin.  This bone was found to be hard and healthy appearing.  The wound after irrigation was free of all debris and infected tissue.  Therefore anaerobic and aerobic cultures were taken and sent to microbiology.  Next, OsteoSet beads, tobramycin-impregnated, were placed.  Six beads were placed in the wound.  Next, the extensor tendon was re-approximated with #3-0 Vicryl.  The subcutaneous layer was closed with #4-0 Vicryl in a simple interrupted technique.  Next, the skin was closed with #4-0 nylon in a horizontal mattress technique.,The Esmarch bandage was released and immediate hyperemic flush was noted at the digits.  A standard postoperative dressing was applied consisting of 4 x 4s, Betadine-soaked #0-1 silk, Kerlix, Kling, and a loosely applied Ace wrap.  The patient tolerated the above anesthesia and procedure without complications.  He was transported via a cart to the Postanesthesia Care Unit.  His vitals signs were stable and vascular status was intact.  He was given a medium postop shoe that was well-formed and fitting.  He is to elevate his foot, but not apply ice.  He is to follow up with Dr. X.  He was given emergency contact numbers.

The patient states she has extreme pain with plantar fascitis in her left foot and has attempted conservative treatment including orthotics without long-term relief of symptoms and desires surgical treatment.  The patient has been NPO since mid night.  Consent is signed and in the chart.  No known drug allergies.,Details Of Procedure:  An IV was instituted by the Department of Anesthesia in the preoperative holding area.  The patient was transported to the operating room and placed on the operating table in supine position with a safety belt across the stomach.  Copious amounts of Webril were placed on the left ankle followed by blood pressure cuff.  After adequate sedation by the Department of Anesthesia, a total of 10 cc of 0.5% Marcaine plain was injected into the surgical site both medially and laterally across the plantar fascia.  The foot was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile orthopedic fashion.  An Esmarch bandage was applied for exsanguination and the pneumatic ankle tourniquet was inflated to 250 mmHg.  The foot was then reflected on the operating, stockinet reflected, and the foot cleansed with a wet and dry sponge.  Attention was then directed to the plantar medial aspect of the left heel.  An approximately 0.75 cm incision was then created in the plantar fat pad over the area of maximal tenderness.,The incision was then deepened with a combination of sharp and blunt dissection until the plantar fascia was palpated.  A #15 blade was then used to transect the medial and central bands of the plantar fascia.  Care was taken to preserve the lateral fibroids.  The foot was dorsiflexed against resistance as the fibers were released and there was noted to be increased laxity after release of the fibers on the plantar aspect of the foot indicating that plantar fascia has in fact been transacted.  The air was then flushed with copious amounts of sterile saline.  The skin incision was then closed with #3-0 nylon in simple interrupted fashion.  Dressings consisted of #0-1 silk, 4 x 4s, Kling, Kerlix, and Coban.  The pneumatic ankle tourniquet was released and immediate hyperemic flush was noted throughout all digits of the left foot.  The patient tolerated the above procedure and anesthesia well without complications.  The patient was transported to the PACU with vital signs stable and vascular status intact to the left foot.  Intraoperatively, an additional 80 cc of 1% lidocaine was injected for additional anesthesia in the case.  The patient is to be nonweightbearing on the left lower extremity with crutches.

       " \"REASON FOR CONSULTATION:, Acute renal failure.,HISTORY: , Limited data is available; I have reviewed his admission notes. Apparently this man was found down by a family member, was taken to Medical Center, and subsequently flown here. He has got respiratory failure, multi-organ system failure syndrome, and has renal insufficiency, as well. Markers of renal function have been fairly stable. I do not presently see indicators that he historically has been oliguric. The BUN and creatinine have been fairly stable. It is not clear whether he was taking his lisinopril up until the time of his demise, and it is also not clear whether he was taking his diuretic. Earlier thoughts had been that he could have had rhabdomyolysis, but the highest CPK I find recorded is 1500, the phosphorus is not elevated, though I acknowledge the serum calcium is low. I see no markers of myoglobinuria nor serum level of myoglobin. He has received IV fluid resuscitation, good broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage, continues mechanically ventilated, and is on parenteral nutrition.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:, Not obtained from the patient, but is reviewed in other physician's notes and seems notable for probably atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease wherein he was taking Imdur and digoxin, reportedly.

Likely due to multi-organ system failure syndrome, with antecedent lisinopril use at home and at time of demise. He also reportedly was on Lasix prior to hospitalization, ? hypovolemia as a consequence.,2. Multi-organ system failure/systemic inflammatory response syndrome, with septic shock.,3. I am under-whelmed presently with the diagnosis of rhabdomyolysis, if the maximum CK recorded is 1500.,4. Antecedent hypoxemia, with renal hypoperfusion.,5. Diffuse aspiration pneumonitis suggested.,DISCUSSION/PLAN: ,I think the renal function will follow the patient. Supportive care, attention to stability of a euvolemic state, will be important at this time. He is currently nonoliguric, has apparently stable, diffuse, bilateral wheezing, with adequate gas exchange. He is on TPN, antimicrobials, and has been on vasopressive agents. Blood pressures are close to acceptable, he may now be wearing off his lisinopril, assuming he was taking it prior to admission.,I would use diuretics to maintain central euvolemia. Recorded I's are substantially O's during the course of the hospitalization, I presume as part of his resuscitation effort. No central pressures or monitoring of same is currently available. I will follow with you. No present indication for hemodialysis. Antimicrobials are being handled by others.\",\n",

The patient has had increasing depression and has been under stress as a result of dissolution of her second marriage.  She notes starting in January, her husband of five years seemed to be quite withdrawn.  It turned out, he was having an affair with one of her best friends and he subsequently moved in with this woman.  The patient is distressed, as over the five years of their marriage, she has gotten herself into considerable debt supporting him and trying to find a career that would work for him.  They had moved to ABCD where he had recently been employed as a restaurant manager.  She also moved her mother and son out there and is feeling understandably upset that he was being dishonest and deceitful with her.  She has history of seasonal affective disorder, winter depressions, characterized by increased sleep, increased irritability, impatience, and fatigue.  Some suggestion on her part that her father may have had some mild bipolar disorder and including the patient has a cyclical and recurrent mood disorder.  In January, she went on citalopram.  She reports since that time, she has lost 40 pounds of weight, has trouble sleeping at night, thinks perhaps her mood got worse on the citalopram, which is possible, though it is also possible that the progressive nature of getting divorce than financial problems has contributed to her worsening mood.,PAST AND DEVELOPMENTAL HISTORY: , She was born in XYZ.  She describes the family as being somewhat dysfunctional.  Father was a truckdriver.  She is an only child.  She reports that she had a history of anorexia and bulimia as a teenager.  In her 20s, she served six years in Naval Reserve.  She was previously married for four years.  She described that as an abusive relationship.  She had a history of being in counseling with ABC, but does not think this therapist, who is now by her estimate 80 years old, is still in practice.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  ,GENERAL:  This is an alert and cooperative woman.,VITAL SIGNS:  Temperature 98.1, pulse 60, respirations 18, blood pressure 95/54, oxygen saturation 95%, and weight is 132.,PSYCHIATRIC:  She makes good eye contact.  Speech is normal in rate, volume, grammar, and vocabulary.  There is no thought disorder.  She denies being suicidal.  Her affect is appropriate for material being discussed.

I did encourage her to go back on the Mirapex, which would likely lead to some improvement in mood by facilitating better sleep.,The patient at this time can contract for safety.  She has made plans for outpatient counseling this Saturday and we will get a referral to a psychiatrist for which she is agreeable to following up with.,LABORATORY DATA: , INR, which is still 8.8.  In 1998, she had a normal MRI.  Electrolytes, BUN, creatinine, and CBC were all normal.,DIAGNOSES:  ,1.  Seasonal depressive disorder.,2.  Restless legs syndrome.,3.  Overdose of citalopram and warfarin.,RECOMMENDATIONS: , The patient reports she has been feeling better since discontinuing antidepressants.  I, therefore, recommend she stay off antidepressants at present.  If needed, she can take Prozac, which has been effective for her in the past and she plans to see a psychiatrist for consultation.  She does give a fairly good history of seasonal depression and given that her mood has improved in the past with Prozac, this will be an appropriate agent to try as needed in the future, but given the situational nature of the depression, she primarily appears to need counseling.,Please feel free to contact me at digital pager if there is additional information I can provide.',\n",

The patient was found to have cholelithiasis on last admission.  He was being worked up for this including cardiac clearance.  However, in the interim, he returned again with another episode of same pain.  The patient had a HIDA scan done yesterday, which shows nonvisualization of the gallbladder consistent with cystic duct obstruction.  Because of these, laparoscopic cholecystectomy was advised with cholangiogram.  Possibility of open laparotomy and open procedure was also explained to the patient.  The procedure, indications, risks, and alternatives were discussed with the patient in detail and informed consent was obtained.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: , The patient was put in supine position on the operating table under satisfactory general anesthesia.  The entire abdomen was prepped and draped.  A small transverse incision was made about 2-1/2 inches above the umbilicus in the midline under local anesthesia.  The patient has a rather long torso.  Fascia was opened vertically and stay sutures were placed in the fascia.  Peritoneal cavity was carefully entered.  Hasson cannula was inserted into the peritoneal cavity and it was insufflated with CO2.  Laparoscopic camera was inserted and examination at this time showed difficult visualization with a part of omentum and hepatic flexure of the colon stuck in the subhepatic area.  The patient was placed in reverse Trendelenburg and rotated to the left.  An 11-mm trocar was placed in the subxiphoid space and two 5-mm in the right subcostal region.  Slowly, the dissection was carried out in the right subhepatic area.  Initially, I was able to dissect some of the omentum and hepatic flexure off the undersurface of the liver.  Then, some inflammatory changes were noted with some fatty necrosis type of changes and it was not quite clear whether this was part of the gallbladder or it was just pericholecystic infection/inflammation.  The visualization was extremely difficult because of the patient's obesity and a lot of fat intra-abdominally, although his abdominal wall is not that thick.  After evaluating this for a little while, we decided that there was no way that this could be done laparoscopically and proceeded with formal laparotomy.  The trocars were removed.,A right subcostal incision was made and peritoneal cavity was entered.  A Bookwalter retractor was put in place.  The dissection was then carried out on the undersurface of the liver.  Eventually, the gallbladder was identified, which was markedly scarred down and shrunk and appeared to have palpable stone in it.  Dissection was further carried down to what was felt to be the common bile duct, which appeared to be somewhat larger than normal about a centimeter in size.  The duodenum was kocherized.  The gallbladder was partly intrahepatic.  Because of this, I decided not to dig it out of the liver bed causing further bleeding and problem.  The inferior wall of the gallbladder was opened and two large stones, one was about 3 cm long and another one about 1.5 x 2 cm long, were taken out of the gallbladder.,It was difficult to tell where the cystic duct was.  Eventually after probing near the neck of the gallbladder, I did find the cystic duct, which was relatively very short.  Intraoperative cystic duct cholangiogram was done using C-arm fluoroscopy.  This showed a rounded density at the lower end of the bile duct consistent with the stone.  At this time, a decision was made to proceed with common duct exploration.  The common duct was opened between stay sutures of 4-0 Vicryl and immediately essentially clear bile came out.  After some pressing over the head of the pancreas through a kocherized maneuver, the stone did fall into the opening in the common bile duct.  So, it was about a 1-cm size stone, which was removed.  Following this, a 10-French red rubber catheter was passed into the common bile duct both proximally and distally and irrigated generously.  No further stones were obtained.  The catheter went easily into the duodenum through the ampulla of Vater.  At this point, a choledochoscope was inserted and proximally, I did not see any evidence of any common duct stones or proximally into the biliary tree.  However, a stone was found distally still floating around.  This was removed with stone forceps.  The bile ducts were irrigated again.  No further stones were removed.  A 16-French T-tube was then placed into the bile duct and the bile duct was repaired around the T-tube using 4-0 Vicryl interrupted sutures obtaining watertight closure.  A completion T-tube cholangiogram was done at this time, which showed slight narrowing and possibly a filling defect proximally below the confluence of the right and left hepatic duct, although externally, I was unable to see anything or palpate anything in this area.  Because of this, the T-tube was removed, and I passed the choledochoscope proximally again, and I was unable to see any evidence of any lesion or any stone in this area.  I felt at this time this was most likely an impression from the outside, which was still left over a gallbladder where the stone was stuck and it was impressing on the bile duct.  The bile duct lumen was widely open.  T-tube was again replaced into the bile duct and closed again and a completion T-tube cholangiogram appeared to be more satisfactory at this time.  The cystic duct opening through which I had done earlier a cystic duct cholangiogram, this was closed with a figure-of-eight suture of 2-0 Vicryl, and this was actually done earlier and completion cholangiogram did not show any leak from this area.,The remaining gallbladder bed, which was left in situ, was cauterized both for hemostasis and to burn off the mucosal lining.  Subhepatic and subdiaphragmatic spaces were irrigated with sterile saline solution.  Hemostasis was good.  A 10-mm Jackson-Pratt drain was left in the foramen of Winslow and brought out through the lateral 5-mm port site.  The T-tube was brought out through the middle 5-mm port site, which was just above the incision.  Abdominal incision was then closed in layers using 0 Vicryl running suture for the peritoneal layer and #1 Novafil running suture for the fascia.  Subcutaneous tissue was closed with 3-0 Vicryl running sutures in two layers.  Subfascial and subcutaneous tissues were injected with a total of 20 mL of 0.25% Marcaine with epinephrine for postoperative pain control.  The umbilical incision was closed with 0 Vicryl figure-of-eight sutures for the fascia, 2-0 Vicryl for the subcutaneous tissues, and staples for the skin.  Sterile dressing was applied, and the patient transferred to recovery room in stable condition.\",\n",

Department of Anesthesia administered general anesthetic.  Once adequately sedated, the patient was placed in the beach chair position.  Care was ensured that she was well positioned, adequately secured and padded.  At this point, the right upper extremity was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  A deltopectoral approach was used and taken down to the skin with a #15 blade scalpel.,At this point, blunt dissection with Mayo scissors was used to come to the overlying subscapular tendon and bursal tissue.  Any perforating bleeders were cauterized with Bovie to obtain hemostasis.  Once the bursa was seen, it was removed with a Rongeur and subscapular tendon could be easily visualized.  At this point, the rotator cuff in the subacromial region was evaluated.  There was noted to be a large rotator cuff, which was irreparable.  There was eburnated bone on the greater tuberosity noted.  The articular surface could be visualized.  The biceps tendon was intact.  There was noted to be diffuse discolored synovium around this as well as some fraying of the tendon in the intraarticular surface.  The under surface of the acromion, it was felt there was mild ware on this as well.  At this point, the subscapular tendon was then taken off using Bovie cautery and Metzenbaum scissors that was tied with Metzenbaum suture.  It was separated from the capsule to have a two layered repair at closure.  The capsule was also reflected posterior.  At this point, the glenoid surface could be easily visualized.  It was evaluated and had good cartilage contact and appeared to be intact.  The humeral head was evaluated.  There was noted to be ware of the cartilage and eburnated bone particularly in the central portion of the humeral head.  At this point, decision was made to proceed with the arthroplasty, since the rotator cuff tear was irreparable and there was significant ware of the humoral head.  The arm was adequately positioned.  An oscillating saw was used to make the head articular cut.  This was done at the margin of the articular surface with the anatomic neck.  This was taken down to appropriate level until this articular surface was adequately removed.  At this point, the intramedullary canal and cancellous bone could be easily visualized.  The opening hand reamers were then used and this was advanced to a size #10.  Under direct visualization, this was performed easily.  At this point, the 10 x 10 proximal flange cutter was then inserted and impacted into place to cut grooves for the fins.  This was then removed.  A trial component was then impacted into place, which did fit well and trial heads were then sampled and it was felt that a size 44 x 21 mm head gave us the best fit and appeared adequately secured.  It did not appear overstuffed with evidence of excellent range of motion and no impingement.  At this point, the trial component was removed.  Wound was copiously irrigated and suctioned dry.  Cement was then placed with a cement gun into the canal and taken up to the level of the cut.  The prosthesis was then inserted into place and held under direct visualization.  All excess cement was removed and care was ensured that no cement was left in the posterior aspect of the joint itself.  This _______ cement was adequately hard at this point.  The final component of the head was impacted into place, secured on the Morris taper and checked, and this was reduced.,The final component was then taken through range of motion and found to have excellent stability and was satisfied with its position.  The wound was again copiously irrigated and suctioned dry.  At this point, the capsule was then reattached to its insertion site in the anterior portion.  Once adequately sutured with #1-Vicryl, attention was directed to the subscapular.  The subscapular was advanced superiorly and anchored not only to the biceps tendon region, but also to the top anterior portion of the greater tuberosity.  This was opened to allow some type of coverage points of the massive rotator cuff tear.  This was secured to the tissue and interosseous sutures with size #2 fiber wire.  After this was adequately secured, the wound was again copiously irrigated and suctioned dry.  The deltoid fascial split was then repaired using interrupted #2-0 Vicryl, subcutaneous tissue was then approximated using interrupted #24-0 Vicryl, skin was approximated using a running #4-0 Vicryl.  Steri-Strips and Adaptic, 4 x 4s, and ABDs were then applied.  The patient was then placed in a sling and transferred back to the gurney, reversed by Department of Anesthesia.,DISPOSITION: , The patient tolerated well and transferred to Postanesthesia Care Unit in satisfactory condition.',\n",

She underwent in situ pinning.  The patient on followup; however, noted to have intraarticular protrusion of her screw.  This was not noted intraoperatively on previous fluoroscopic views.  Given this finding, I explained to the father and especially the mother that this can cause further joint damage and that the screw would need to be exchanged for a shorter one.  Risks and benefits of surgery were discussed.  Risks of surgery include risk of anesthesia, infection, bleeding, changes in sensation and motion of the extremity, failure to remove the screw, possible continued joint stiffness or damage.  All questions were answered and parents agreed to above plan.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , The patient was taken to the operating room and placed supine on the operating table.  General anesthesia was then administered.  The patient received Ancef preoperatively.  A small bump was placed underneath her right buttock.  The right upper thigh was then prepped and draped in standard surgical fashion.  The upper aspect of the incision was reincised.  The dissection was carried down to the crew, which was easily found.  A guidewire was placed inside the screw with subsequent removal of the previous screw.  The previous screw measured 65 mm.  A 60 mm screw was then placed under direct visualization with fluoroscopy.  The hip was taken through full range of motion to check on the length of the screw, which demonstrated no intraarticular protrusion.  The guidewire was removed.  The wound was then irrigated and closed using 2-0 Vicryl in the fascial layer as well as the subcutaneous fat.  The skin was closed with 4-0 Monocryl.  The wound was cleaned and dried, dressed with Steri-Strips, Xeroform, 4 x 4s, and tape.

The patient was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion in the dorsal supine position with a leftward tilt.  A Pfannenstiel skin incision was made with the scalpel and carried through to the underlying layer of fascia using the Bovie.  The fascia was incised in the midline and extended laterally using Mayo scissors.  Kocher clamps were used to elevate the superior aspect of the fascial incision, which was elevated, and the underlying rectus muscles were dissected off bluntly and using Mayo scissors.  Attention was then turned to the inferior aspect of the fascial incision, which in similar fashion was grasped with Kocher clamps, elevated, and the underlying rectus muscles were dissected off bluntly and using the Bovie.  The rectus muscles were dissected in the midline.,The peritoneum was identified and entered using Metzenbaum scissors; this incision was extended superiorly and inferiorly with good visualization of the bladder.  The bladder blade was inserted.  The vesicouterine peritoneum was identified and entered sharply using Metzenbaum scissors.  This incision was extended laterally and the bladder flap was created digitally.  The bladder blade was reinserted.  The lower uterine segment was incised in a transverse fashion using the scalpel and extended using bandage scissors as well as manual traction.,Clear fluid was noted.  The infant was subsequently delivered using a Kelly vacuum due to anteflexed head and difficulty in delivering the infant's head without the Kelly.  The nose and mouth were bulb suctioned.  The cord was clamped and cut.  The infant was subsequently handed to the awaiting nursery nurse.  The placenta was delivered spontaneously intact with a three-vessel cord noted.  The uterus was exteriorized and cleared of all clots and debris.  The uterine incision was repaired in 2 layers using 0 chromic sutures.  Hemostasis was visualized.

The patient was taken to the Cardiac Catheterization Suite where the right subclavian region was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  1% lidocaine solution was used to infiltrate the skin overlying the left subclavian vein.  Once adequate anesthesia had been obtained, a thin-walled #18-gauze Argon needle was used to cannulate the left subclavian vein.  A steel guidewire was inserted through the needle into the vascular lumen without resistance.  The needle was then removed over the guidewire and the guidewire was secured to the field.  A second #18 gauze Argon needle was used to cannulate the left subclavian vein and once again a steel guidewire was inserted through the needle into the vascular lumen.  Likewise, the needle was removed over the guidewire and the guidewire was then secured to the field.  Next, a #15-knife blade was used to make a 1 to 1.5 inch linear incision over the area.  A #11-knife blade was used to make a deeper incision.  Hemostasis was made complete.  The edges of the incision were grasped and retracted.  Using Metzenbaum scissors, dissection was carried down to the pectoralis muscle fascial plane.  Digital blunt dissection was used to make a pacemaker pocket large enough to accommodate the pacemaker generator.  Metzenbaum scissors were then used to dissect cephalad to expose the guide wires.  The guidewires were then pulled through the pacemaker pocket.  One guidewire was secured to the field.,A bloodless introducer sheath was then advanced over a guidewire into the vascular lumen under fluoroscopic guidance.  The guidewire and dilator were then removed.  Next, a ventricular pacemaker lead was advanced through the sheath and into the vascular lumen and under fluoroscopic guidance guided down into the right atrium.  The pacemaker lead was then placed in the appropriate position in the right ventricle.  Pacing and sensing thresholds were obtained.  The lead was sewn at the pectoralis muscle plane using #2-0 silk suture in an interrupted stitch fashion around the ________.  Pacing and sensing threshold were then reconfirmed.  Next, a second bloodless introducer sheath was advanced over the second guidewire into the vascular lumen.  The guidewire and dilator were then removed.

It is not associated with movement, but occasionally the pain was so bad that it was associated with vomiting.  She has tried LactAid, which initially helped, but then the pain returned.  She has tried changing her diet and Pepcid AC.  She was seen at XYZ where blood work was done.  At that time, she had a normal white count and a normal H&H.  She was given muscle relaxants, which did not work.,Approximately two weeks ago, she was seen in the emergency room at XYZ where a pelvic ultrasound was done.  This showed a 1.9 x 1.4-cm cyst on the right with no free fluid.  The left ovary and uterus appeared normal.  Two days later, the pain resolved and she has not had a recurrence.  She denies constipation and diarrhea.  She has had some hot flashes, but has not taken her temperature.,In addition, she states that her periods have been very irregular coming between four and six weeks.  They are associated with cramping which she is not happy about.,She has never had a pelvic exam.  She states she is not sexually active and declined having her mother leave the room, so she was not questioned regarding this without her mother present.  She is very interested in not having pain with her periods and if this was a cyst that caused her pain, she is interested in starting birth control pills to prevent this from happening again.,PAST MEDICAL HX:  ,Pneumonia in 2002, depression diagnosed in 2005, and seizures as an infant.,PAST SURGICAL HX:  ,Plastic surgery on her ear after a dog bite in 1997.,MEDICATIONS:  ,Zoloft 50 mg a day and LactAid.,ALLERGIES:  ,NO KNOWN DRUG ALLERGIES.,SOCIAL HX: , She enjoys cooking and scrapbooking.

This pain interfered with activities of daily living and was unimproved with conservative treatment modalities.  She is understanding the risks, benefits, and potential complications as well as all treatment alternatives.  The patient provided informed consent.,OPERATIVE TECHNIQUE: , The patient was taken to OR #2 where she was placed prone on the Jackson spinal table.  She was given sedative.  The thoracodorsal spine was then sterilely prepped and draped in the usual fashion.  Biplanar image intensification was utilized to localize the T8, T7, and T9 vertebrae.  Local anesthetic of 1% Marcaine with epinephrine and lidocaine were 50:50 mixed.,Approximately 7 cc was instilled on the left side.  This was directly over the posterior aspect of the pedicle on the left.  Once this was localized, the right side was localized as well.  Stab incisions were then created over the pedicles of T8 bilaterally.  Jamshidi needles were then placed percutaneously.  Their position was verified in both AP and lateral images.  They were advanced slowly under direct image intensification in biplanar fashion.  Once these were satisfactorily placed, the inner trocar was removed and a guidewire was inserted into the depths of the T7 vertebrae.  The Jamshidi needles were then removed.  A biopsy was then harvested with a biopsy trocar placed into the T8 vertebrae.  This bone was then removed and sent to the lab.  The injection cannulas were then placed over the guidewires and their position was verified in both AP and lateral images.  Once this was completed, a second Jamshidi needle was placed at the T7 vertebrae on the left at the entrance of the pedicle.  This was advanced under direct image intensification in a biplanar fashion.  Once this was deemed satisfactory, it was impacted.  The inner trocar was removed and a guidewire was then placed.  An injection cannula was then placed over the guidewire into the body of T7.  In a similar fashion, T9 was dressed on the left side as well.  A guidewire was then placed through the Jamshidi needle, which was verified in both AP and lateral images.  The cement injection cannula was then placed over this entering the T9 vertebrae body.  Attention was then turned to the kyphoplasty portion of the procedure at the T8 vertebrae.  The balloons were inserted bilaterally.  The balloons were then inflated under direct image intensification and pressurized to approximately 200 mmHg.  These were allowed to expand and reduce the fracture.  Once this was completed, the balloons were deflated and removed.  The inner cannulas of all four entrance holes were removed and approximately 1.5 cc of cement was injected in each of the cannulas.  This was done directly under image intensification.  Once this was completed, additional cement was injected into T9 as there was a larger vertebra.  The cement was allowed to cure.  The cannula was removed and final radiographs were obtained.  The stab incisions were then cleansed with water and antibiotic irrigation.  The wounds were then approximated with #4-0 Nylon in interrupted fashion.  Compression dressings were applied and fixed with tape.  She was aroused and moved to her inpatient bed.  She was moving all four extremities without deficit.  She had no significant pain.',\n",

An incision was made over the posterior spinous process of T10, T11, T12, L1, and L2.  A Weitlaner retractor was placed and cutting Bovie current was used to incise the fascia overlying the dorsal spinous process of T10, T11, T12, L1, and L2.  An additional muscular ligamentous attachment was dissected free bilaterally with cutting Bovie current osteotome and Cobb elevator.  The cerebellar retractors were placed in the wound and obvious deformation of the lamina particularly on the left side at T12 was apparent.  Initially, on the patient's left side, pedicle screws were placed in T11 and L1.  The inferior articular facet was removed at T11 and an awl placed at the proximal location of the pedicle.  Placement confirmed with biplanar coaxial fluoroscopy.  The awl was in appropriate location and using a pedicle finder under fluoroscopic control, the pedicle was probed to the mid portion of the body of T11.  A 40-mm Click'X screw, 6.5 mm diameter with rod holder was then threaded into the T11 vertebral body.,Attention was next turned to the L1 level on the left side and the junction of the transverse processes with the superior articular facet and intra-articular process was located using an AM-8 dissecting tool, AM attachment to the Midas Rex instrumentation.  The area was decorticated, an awl was placed, and under fluoroscopic biplanar imaging noted to be at the pedicle in L1.  Using a pedicle probe, the pedicle was then probed to the mid body of L1 and a 7-mm diameter 45-mm in length Click'X Synthes screw with rod holder was placed in the L1 vertebral body.,At this point, an elongated rod was placed on the left side for purposes of distraction should it be felt necessary in view of the MRI findings of significant compression on the patient's ventral canal on the right side.  Attention was next turned to the right side and it should be noted that the dissection above was carried out with operating room microscope and at this point, the intraspinous process ligament superior to the posterior spinous process at T12 was noted be completely disrupted on a traumatic basis.  The anteroposterior spinous process ligament superior to the T12 was incised with cutting Bovie current and the posterior spinous process at T12 removed with a Leksell rongeur.  It was necessary to remove portion of the posterior spinous process at T11 for a full visualization of the involved laminar fractures at T12.,At this point, a laminectomy was performed using 45-degree Kerrison rongeur, both 2 mm and 4 mm, and Leksell rongeur.  There was an epidural hematoma encountered to the midline and left side at the mid portion of the T12 laminectomy and this was extending superiorly to the T11-T12 interlaminar space.  Additionally, there was marked instability of the facets bilaterally at T12 and L1.  These facets were removed with 45-degree Kerrison rongeur and Leksell rongeur.  Bony compression both superiorly and laterally from fractured bony elements was removed with 45-degree Kerrison rongeur until the thecal sac was completely decompressed.  The exiting nerve roots at T11 and T12 were visualized and followed with Frazier dissectors, and these nerve roots were noted to be completely free.  Hemostasis was controlled with bipolar coagulation.,At this point, a Frazier dissector could be passed superiorly, inferiorly, medially, and laterally to the T11-T12 nerve roots bilaterally, and the thecal sac was noted to be decompressed both superiorly and inferiorly, and noted to be quite pulsatile.  A #4 Penfield was then used to probe the floor of the spinal canal, and no significant ventral compression remained on the thecal sac.  Copious antibiotic irrigation was used and at this point on the patient's right side, pedicle screws were placed at T11 and L1 using the technique described for a left-sided pedicle screw placement.  The anatomic landmarks being the transverse process at T11, the inferior articulating facet, and the lateral aspect of the superior articular facet for T11 and at L1, the transverse process, the junction of the intra-articular process and the facet joint.,With the screws placed on the left side, the elongated rod was removed from the patient's right side along with the locking caps, which had been placed.  It was felt that distraction was not necessary.  A 75-mm rod could be placed on the patient's left side with reattachment of the locking screw heads with the rod cap locker in place; however, it was necessary to cut a longer rod for the patient's right side with the screws slightly greater distance apart ultimately settling on a 90-mm rod.  The locking caps were placed on the right side and after all 4 locking caps were placed, the locking cap screws were tied to the cold weld.  Fluoroscopic examination demonstrated no evidence of asymmetry at the intervertebral space at T11-T12 or T12-L1 with excellent positioning of the rods and screws.  A crosslink approximately 60 mm in width was then placed between the right and left rods, and all 4 screws were tightened.,It should be noted that prior to the placement of the rods, the patient's autologous bone, which had been removed during laminectomy portion of the procedure and cleansed off soft tissue and morcellated was packed in the posterolateral space after decortication had been effected on the transverse processes at T11, T12, and L1 with AM-8 dissecting tool, AM attachment as well as the lateral aspects of the facet joints.  This was done bilaterally prior to placement of the rods.,Following placement of the rods as noted above, allograft bone chips were packed in addition on top of the patient's own allograft in these posterolateral gutters.  Gelfoam was used to cover the thecal sac and at this point, the wound was closed by approximating the deep muscle with 0 Vicryl suture.  The fascia was closed with interrupted 0 Vicryl suture, subcutaneous layer was closed with 2-0 Vicryl suture, subcuticular layer was closed with 2-0 inverted interrupted Vicryl suture, and the skin approximated with staples.  The patient appeared to tolerate the procedure well without complications.\",\n",

There was no reported head or neck injury or alteration of consciousness. She was treated and released from a local ER the same day. Her husband noted the development of mild dysarthria, incoordination, headache and exacerbation of preexisting lower back pain within 2 week of the accident. In 4/94 she developed stress urinary incontinence which spontaneously resolved in June. In 8/94, her HA changed from a dull constant aching in the bitemporal region to a sharper constant pain in the nuchal/occipital area. She also began experiencing increased blurred vision, worsening dysarthria and difficulty hand writing. In 9/94 she was evaluated by a local physician. Examination then revealed incoordination, generalized fatigue, and dysarthria. Soon after this she became poorly arousable and increasingly somnolent. She had difficulty walking and generalized weakness. On 10/14/94, she lost the ability to walk by herself.

She has symptomatic partial epilepsy secondary to a static encephalopathy, cerebral palsy, and shunted hydrocephalus related to prematurity.  She also has a history of factor V Leiden deficiency.  She was last seen at neurology clinic on 11/16/2007.  At that time, instructions were given to mom to maximize her Trileptal dose if seizures continue.  She did well on 2 mL twice a day without any sedation.  This past Friday, she had a 25-minute seizure reportedly.  This consisted of eye deviation, unresponsiveness, and posturing.  Diastat was used and which mom perceived was effective.  Her Trileptal dose was increased to 3 mL b.i.d. yesterday.,According to mom since her shunt revision on 12/18/2007, she has been sleepier than normal.  She appeared to be stable until this past Monday about six days ago, she became more lethargic and had episodes of vomiting and low-grade fevers.  According to mom, she had stopped vomiting since her hospitalization.  Reportedly, she was given a medication in the emergency room.  She still is lethargic, will not wake up spontaneously.  When she does awaken however, she is appropriate, and interacts with them.  She is able to eat well; however her overall p.o. intake has been diminished.  She has also been less feisty as her usual sounds.  She has been seizure free since her admission.,LABORATORY DATA: , Pertinent labs obtained here showed the following:  CRP is less than 0.3, CMP normal, and CBC within normal limits.  CSF cultures so far is negative.  Dr. Limon's note refers to a CSF, white blood cell count of 2, 1 RBC, glucose of 55, and protein of 64.  There are no imaging studies in the computer.  I believe that this may have been done at Kaweah Delta Hospital and reviewed by Dr. X, who indicated that there was no evidence of shunt malfunction or infection.,CURRENT MEDICATIONS: , Trileptal 180 mg b.i.d., lorazepam 1 mg p.r.n., acetaminophen, and azithromycin.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,GENERAL:  The patient was asleep, but easily aroused.  There was a brief period of drowsiness, which she had some jerky limb movements, but not seizures.  She eventually started crying and became agitated.  She made attempts to sit by bending her neck forward.  Fully awake, she sucks her bottle eagerly.,HEENT:  She was obviously visually impaired.  Pupils were 3 mm, sluggishly reactive to light.,EXTREMITIES:  Bilateral lower extremity spasticity was noted.  There was increased flexor tone in the right upper extremity.  IV was noted on the left hand.,ASSESSMENT:  ,Seizure breakthrough due to intercurrent febrile illness.  Her lethargy could be secondary to a viral illness with some component of medication effect since her Trileptal dose was increased yesterday and these are probable explanations if indeed shunt malfunction has been excluded.,I concur with Dr. X's recommendations.  I do not recommend any changes in Trileptal for now.  I will be available while she remains hospitalized.,\",\n",

The bilateral tubes and ovaries appeared normal.,There was evidence of endometriosis on the posterior wall of the uterus as well as the bilateral infundibulopelvic ligament.  There was some adhesions of the bowel to the left ovary and infundibulopelvic ligament and as well as to the right infundibulopelvic ligament.,PROCEDURE:,  After consent was obtained, the patient was taken to the operating room where spinal anesthetic was first administered and then general anesthetic.  The patient was placed in the dorsal supine position and prepped and draped in normal sterile fashion.  A Pfannenstiel skin incision was made and carried to the underlying Mayo fashion using the second knife.  The fascia was incised in midline and the incision extended laterally using Mayo scissors.  The superior aspect of the fascial incision was grasped with Kocher clamps, tented up, and dissected off the underlying rectus muscle both bluntly and sharply with Mayo scissors.  Attention was then turned to the inferior aspect of the incision, which in a similar fashion was grasped with Kocher clamps, tented up and dissected off the underlying rectus muscles.  The rectus muscles were separated in the midline and the peritoneum was identified, grasped with hemostat, and entered sharply with Metzenbaum scissors.  This incision was extended superiorly and inferiorly with good visualization of the bladder.  The uterus was then brought up out of the incision.  The bowel adhesions were carefully taken down using Metzenbaum scissors.  Good hemostasis was noted at this point.  The self-retaining retractor was then placed.  The bladder blade was placed.  The bowel was gently packed with moist laparotomy sponges and held in place with the blade on the GYN extension.  The uterus was then grasped with a Lahey clamp and brought up out of the incision.  The left round ligament was identified and grasped with Allis clamp and tented up.  A hemostat was passed in the avascular area beneath the round ligament.  A suture #0 Vicryl was used to suture ligate the round ligament.  Two hemostats were placed across the round ligament proximal to the previously placed suture and the Mayo scissors were used to transect the round ligament.  An avascular area of the broad ligament was then identified and entered bluntly.  The suture of #0 Vicryl was then used to suture ligate the left uterovarian ligament.  Two straight Ochsner's were placed across the uterovarian ligament proximal to the previous suture.  The ligament was then transected and suture ligated with #0 Vicryl.  Attention was then turned to the right round ligament, which in a similar fashion was tented up with an Allis clamp.  An avascular area was entered beneath the round ligament using a hemostat and the round ligament was suture ligated and transected.  An avascular area of the broad ligament was then entered bluntly and the right uterovarian ligament was then suture ligated with #0 Vicryl.,Two straight Ochsner's were placed across the ligament proximal to previous suture.  This was then transected and suture ligated again with #0 Vicryl.  The left uterine peritoneum was then identified and grasped with Allis clamps.  The vesicouterine peritoneum was then transected and then entered using Metzenbaum scissors.  This incision was extended across the anterior portion of the uterus and the bladder flap was taken down.  It was sharply advanced with Metzenbaum scissors and then bluntly using a moist Ray-Tec.  The Ray-Tec was left in place at this point to ensure that the bladder was below the level of the cervix.  The bilateral uterine arteries then were skeletonized with Metzenbaum scissors and clamped bilaterally using straight Ochsner's.  Each were then transected and suture ligated with #0 Vicryl.  A curved Ochsner was then placed on either side of the cervix.  The tissue was transected using a long knife and suture ligated with #0 Vicryl.  Incidentally, prior to taking down the round ligaments, a pedunculated fibroid and the right fundal portion of the uterus was injected with Vasopressin and removed using a Bovie.  The cervix was then grasped with a Lahey clamp.  The cervicovaginal fascia was then taken down first using the long-handed knife and then a back handle of the knife to bring the fascia down below the level of the cervix.  A double-pointed scissors were used to enter the vaginal vault below the level of the cervix.  A straight Ochsner was placed on the vaginal vault.  The Jorgenson scissors were used to amputate the cervix and the uterus off of the underlying vaginal tissue.  The vaginal cuff was then reapproximated with #0 Vicryl in a running locked fashion and the pelvis was copiously irrigated.  There was a small area of bleeding noted on the underside of the bladder.  The bladder was tented up using an Allis clamp and a figure-of-eight suture of #3-0 Vicryl was placed with excellent hemostasis noted at this point.  The uterosacral ligaments were then incorporated into the vaginal cuff and the cuff was synched down.  A figure-of-eight suture of #0 Vicryl was placed in the midline of the vaginal cuff in attempt to incorporate the bilateral round ligament.  The round ligament was too short.  It would be a maximal amount of stretch to incorporate, therefore, only the left round ligament was incorporated into the vaginal cuff.  The bilateral adnexal areas were then re-peritonealized with #3-0 Vicryl in a running fashion.  The bladder flap was reapproximated to the vaginal cuff using one interrupted suture.  The pelvis was again irrigated at this point with excellent hemostasis noted.  Approximately 200 cc of saline with methylene blue was placed into the Foley to inflate the bladder.  There was no spillage of blue fluid into the abdomen.  The fluid again was allowed to drain.  All sponges were then removed and the bowel was allowed to return to its anatomical position.  The peritoneum was then reapproximated with #0 Vicryl in a running fashion.  The fascia was reapproximated also with #0 Vicryl in a running fashion.  The skin was then closed with staples.,A previously placed Betadine soaked Ray-Tec was removed from the patient's vagina and sponge stick was used to assess any bleeding in the vaginal vault.  There was no appreciable bleeding.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  Sponge, lap, and needle counts were correct x2.  The patient was taken to the recovery room in satisfactory condition.  She will be followed immediately postoperatively within the hospital.\",\n",

       " \"ALLOWED CONDITIONS:,  Sprain of left knee and leg.,CONTESTED CONDITION:,  Left knee tear medial meniscus, left knee ACL tear.,EMPLOYER:,  YYYY,REQUESTING PARTY:,  XXXX,Mr. XXXXXX is a xx-year-old male who was evaluated for an independent medical examination on September 20, 2007, because of an injury sustained to the left leg.  The injured worker does state that he was working as a processor for the ABCD Company on July 18, 2007, when he injured his left knee.  He does state he was working in a catwalk when he stepped up.  He noticed his sight glass was not open on the tank.  He then stepped straight down and his knee went sideways.  His knee popped and he sat down secondary to discomfort.  At that time he could not do any type of activity secondary to the pain.  The nurse called the ambulance subsequent to this injury and he was taken to Bethesda North.  X-rays were obtained which demonstrated no evidence of fracture.  Thereafter, he was referred to X who he saw on July 19, 2007.  It was felt that a MRI scan about the knee needed to be obtained and it was obtained on July 24.  It was noted that there was evidence of an anterior cruciate ligament tear and a slight medial meniscal tear.  On his second visit, it was felt that arthroscopic surgery intervention was indicated as related to the left knee.,On September 7, 2007, he underwent surgical intervention at ABC for the anterior cruciate reconstruction as well as the partial medial meniscectomy.,At the present time, he is progressing along with physical therapy.  He is utilizing one crutch.,He does admit to significant bruising and swelling about the left lower extremity.  If he does indeed move too fast, the discomfort is increased.  His pain about the left knee is approximately 6 to 7 on a scale of 1 to 10.,He has had injuries to the right knee in which he wrecked his bicycle and did have some type of fracture bone spur when he was 13 years of age.,He underwent arthroscopic surgery as related to the right knee at that time and really did quite well.,His next appointment with Dr. X is on October 4, 2007.,The injured worker denies any previous history of similar problems as related to the left knee.,MEDICATIONS: , Glucophage, Lipitor, Actos, Benicar, glimepiride, and Januvia.,SURGICAL HISTORY:,  Arthroscopic surgery of the left knee and arthroscopic surgery of the right knee.,SOCIAL HISTORY:,  The patient denies alcohol consumption.  He does smoke approximately one and a half packs of cigarettes per day.  His education is that of 12th grade.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: , This is a healthy appearing 34-year-old male who is 5 feet 9 inches and weighs 285 pounds.  He does not appear to be in distress at this time.  Examination is limited to the left knee.  One could appreciate a healed scar as related to the inferior pole inferior to the patella.  There are healed arthroscopic scars as well.  The range of motion of left knee reveals 50 to 70 degrees of flexion.  There is evidence of medial and lateral joint line discomfort.  Anterior Lachman's test was negative.  No evidence of atrophy is noted.  There is weakness with aggressive function about the quadriceps and hamstring musculature.,The patient is ambulating with one crutch at this time.,There is mild degree of swelling as related to the left knee.  Deep tendon reflexes are +2/+2 bilaterally symmetrical.  Sensory examination was normal as related to the foot, but abnormal as related to the left knee.,I did review pictures that were taken at the time of the surgery, which demonstrates the meniscectomy and the anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction.,MEDICAL RECORDS REVIEW:,1.  July 18, 2007, x-rays of the left knee demonstrated evidence of a small suprapatellar joint effusion.  It should be noted that the exam demonstrated evidence of medial and lateral joint line discomfort.  There was specific mention of intraarticular effusion.,2.  On July 27, 2007, MRI scan of the left knee was obtained, which demonstrated evidence of the complete tear of the mid to distal ACL.  Findings suggestive of a chronic injury.  Grade I sprain of the MCL was noted.  Contusion __________ plateau medial femoral condyle and lateral femoral condyle was noted.  There was evidence of a small peripheral longitudinal tear of the posterior horn of medial meniscus.  Chondromalacia of the lateral femoral condyle and patella was noted.  It should be noted that the changes of degeneration of the cartilages of the injured worker's knee and the chronic anterior cruciate ligament changes were noted related to the July 18, 2007, injury.,3.  July 18, 2007, first report of injury, occupational disease, and/or death.,4.  Evaluations of ABCD Hospital.  It should be noted that the mechanism of injury was such that he was walking down the stairs when his left knee locked up.,5.  July 18, 2007, x-rays of the left knee were obtained, which demonstrated the evidence of no acute fracture or significant osteoarthritis.  There is evidence there maybe a small suprapatellar joint effusion.,6.  Notes from the office of Dr. X. It should be noted on physical examination his range of motion is 8 to 20 degrees.,7.  Physical therapy prescription for __________ Orthopedics and Sports Medicine Corporation.,8.  August 10, 2007, requests for arthroscopic anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with patellar tendon.,9.  Physician narrative of August 24, 2007.  It is noted that the injured worker did indeed have evidence of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes.  His BMI was 42.  This was felt __________ pre-injury MRI scan.,Following your review of the medical information and your physical examination, please answer the following questions as these pertain to the allowed conditions.  Please express your opinion based upon a reasonable degree of medical probability.,QUESTION: ,Mr. XXXXXX has filed an application for the additional allowance of left knee tear of the medial meniscus and left knee ACL tear.,Based on the current objective findings, mechanism of injury, or and medical records or diagnosis studies, does the medical evidence support the existence of any of the requested conditions.,ANSWER: ,The MRI sustains and verifies that these conditions do indeed exist subsequent to the injury of July 18, 2007.,QUESTION: ,If you find any of these conditions exist, are they a direct and proximate result of the July 18, 2007, injury.,ANSWER: ,There is mention of degeneration as related to the knee prior to this episode.  This is not surprising considering the individual's weight.  There is no question degeneration as related to anterior cruciate ligament and the meniscus has been occurring for a lengthy period of time.  There has been an aggravation of this condition.  Without having a MRI to review prior to this injury, I believe, it would be safe to assume that there has been aggravation of a pre-existing condition as related to the left knee and __________ meniscal and anterior cruciate ligament pathology.  Thus there is definitely evidence of an aggravation of a pre-existing condition but not necessarily a direct and proximate result of the July 18, 2007, injury.,QUESTION: \",\n",

She states she has had numerous chemotherapy and radiation treatments and told me that she has lost count.  She says she has just finished a series of 10 radiation treatments for pain relief.  She states she continues to have significant pain symptoms.  Most of her pain seems to be in her low back on the right side, radiating down the back of her right leg to her knee.  She has also some numbness in the bottom of her left foot, and some sharp pain in the left foot at times.  She complains of some diffuse, mid back pain.  She describes the pain as sharp, dull, and aching in nature.  She rates her back pain as 10, her right leg pain as 10, with 0 being no pain and 10 being the worst possible pain.  She states that it seems to be worse while sitting in the car with prolonged sitting, standing, or walking.  She is on significant doses of narcotics.  She has had multiple CT scans looking for metastasis.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:,  Significant for cancer as above.  She also has a depression.,PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:,  Significant for a chest port placement.,CURRENT MEDICATIONS:,  Consist of Duragesic patch 250 mcg total, Celebrex 200 mg once daily, iron 240 mg twice daily, Paxil 20 mg daily, and Percocet.

Reflexes are 2+ in both knees and absent at both ankles.  Sensations are decreased distally in the left foot, otherwise intact to pinprick.,Spine:  Examination of her lumbar spine shows normal lumbar lordosis with fairly functional range of movement.  The patient had significant tenderness at her lower lumbar facet and sacroiliac joints, which seems to reproduce a lot of her low back and right leg complaints.,FUNCTIONAL EXAMINATION: , Gait has a normal stance and swing phase with no antalgic component to it.,INVESTIGATION: , She has had again multiple scans including a whole body bone scan, which showed abnormal uptake involving the femurs bilaterally.  She has had increased uptake in the sacroiliac joint regions bilaterally.  CT of the chest showed no evidence of recurrent metastatic disease.  CT of the abdomen showed no evidence of metastatic disease.  MRI of the lower hip joints showed heterogenous bone marrow signal in both proximal femurs.  CT of the pelvis showed a trabecular pattern with healed metastases.  CT of the orbits showed small amount of fluid in the mastoid air cells on the right, otherwise normal CT scan.  MR of the brain showed no acute intracranial abnormalities and no significant interval changes.,IMPRESSION:,1.  Small cell lung cancer with metastasis at the lower lumbar spine, pelvis, and both femurs.,2.  Symptomatic facet and sacroiliac joint syndrome on the right.,3.  Chronic pain syndrome.,RECOMMENDATIONS:,  Dr. XYZ and I discussed with the patient her pathology.  Dr. XYZ explained her although she does have lung cancer metastasis, she seems to be symptomatic with primarily pain at her lower lumbar facet and sacroiliac joints on the right.  Secondary to the patient's significant pain complaints today, Dr. XYZ will plan on injecting her right sacroiliac and facet joints under fluoroscopy today.  I explained the rationale for the procedure, possible complications, and she voiced understanding and wished to proceed.  She understands that she is on warfarin therapy and that we generally do not perform injections while they are on this.  We have asked for stat protime today.  She is on a very small dose, she states she has had previous biopsies while on this before, and did not have any complications.  She is on significant dose of narcotics already, however, she continues to have pain symptoms.  Dr. XYZ advised that if she continues to have pain, even after this injection, she could put on an extra 50 mcg patch and take a couple of extra Percocet if needed.  I will plan on evaluating her in the Clinic on Tuesday.  I have also asked that she stop her Paxil, and we plan on starting her on Cymbalta instead.  She voiced understanding and is in agreement with this plan.  I have also asked her to get an x-ray of the lumbar spine for further evaluation.  Physical exam, findings, history of present illness, and recommendations were performed with and in agreement with Dr. G's findings.  Peripheral neuropathy of her left foot is most likely secondary to her chemo and radiation treatments.\",\n",

       " 'REASON FOR VISIT:  ,The patient is a 76-year-old man referred for neurological consultation by Dr. X.  The patient is companied to clinic today by his wife and daughter.  He provides a small portion of his history; however, his family provides virtually all of it.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , He has trouble with walking and balance, with bladder control, and with thinking and memory.  When I asked him to provide me detail, he could not tell me much more than the fact that he has trouble with his walking and that he has trouble with his bladder.  He is vaguely aware that he has trouble with his memory.,According to his family, he has had difficulty with his gait for at least three or four years.  At first, they thought it was weakness and because of he was on the ground (for example, gardening) he was not able to get up by himself.  They did try stopping the statin that he was taking at that time, but because there was no improvement over two weeks, they resumed the statin.  As time progressed, he developed more and more difficulty.  He started to shuffle.  He started using a cane about two and a half years ago and has used a walker with wheels in the front since July of 2006.  At this point, he frequently if not always has trouble getting in or out of the seat.  He frequently tends to lean backwards or sideways when sitting.  He frequently if not always has trouble getting in or out a car, always shuffles or scuffs his feet, always has trouble turning or changing direction, always has trouble with uneven surfaces or curbs, and always has to hold on to someone or something when walking.  He has not fallen in the last month.  He did fall earlier, but there seemed to be fewer opportunities for him to fall.  His family has recently purchased a lightweight wheelchair to use if he is traveling long distances.  He has no stairs in his home, however, his family indicates that he would not be able to take stairs.  His handwriting has become smaller and shakier.,In regard to the bladder, he states, \"I wet the bed.\"  In talking with his family, it seems as if he has no warning that he needs to empty his bladder.  He was diagnosed with a small bladder tumor in 2005.  This was treated by Dr. Y.  Dr. X does not think that the bladder tumor has anything to do with the patient\\'s urinary incontinence.  The patient has worn a pad or undergarment for at least one to one and a half years.  His wife states that they go through two or three of them per day.  He has been placed on medications; however, they have not helped.,He has no headaches or sensation of head fullness.,In regard to the thinking and memory, at first he seemed forgetful and had trouble with dates.  Now he seems less spontaneous and his family states he seems to have trouble expressing himself.  His wife took over his medications about two years ago.  She stopped his driving about three years ago.  She discovered that his license had been expired for about a year and she was concerned enough at that time that she told him he could drive no more.  Apparently, he did not object.  At this point, he frequently has trouble with memory, orientation, and everyday problems solving at home.  He needs coaching for his daily activities such as reminders to brush his teeth, put on his clothes, and so forth.  He is a retired office machine repairman.  He is currently up and active about 12 hours a day and sleeping or lying down about 12 hours per day.,He has not had PT or OT and has not been treated with medications for Parkinson\\'s disease or Alzheimer\\'s disease.  He has been treated for the bladder.  He has not had lumbar puncture.,Past medical history and review of all 14 systems from the form they completed for this visit that I reviewed with them is negative with the exception that he has had hypertension since 1985, hypercholesterolemia since 1997, and diabetes since 1998.  The bladder tumor was discovered in 2005 and was treated noninvasively.  He has lost weight from about 200 pounds to 180 pounds over the last two or three years.  He had a period of depression in 1999 and was on Prozac for a while, but this was then stopped.  He used to drink a significant amount of alcohol.  This was problematic enough that his wife was concerned.  She states he stopped when she retired and she was at home all day.,SOCIAL HISTORY:  ,He quit smoking in 1968.  His current weight is 183 pounds.  His tallest height is 5 feet 10 inches.,FAMILY HISTORY:  ,His grandfather had arthritis.  His father had Parkinson\\'s disease.  His mother had heart disease and a sister has diabetes.,He does not have a Living Will and indicates he would wish his wife to make decisions for him if he could not make them for himself.,REVIEW OF HYDROCEPHALUS RISK FACTORS: , None.,ALLERGIES: , None.,MEDICATIONS: , Metformin 500 mg three times a day, Lipitor 10 mg per day, lisinopril 20 mg per day, metoprolol 50 mg per day, Uroxatral 10 mg per day, Detrol LA 4 mg per day, and aspirin 81 mg per day.,PHYSICAL EXAM: , On examination today, this is a pleasant 76-year-old man who is guided back from the clinic waiting area walking with his walker.  He is well developed, well nourished, and kempt.,Vital Signs:  His weight is 180 pounds.,Head:  The head is normocephalic and atraumatic.

There is no scoliosis.,Skin:  No neurocutaneous stigmata.,Cardiovascular Examination:  No carotid or vertebral bruits.,Mental Status:  Assessed for orientation, recent and remote memory, attention span, concentration, language, and fund of knowledge.  The Mini-Mental State Exam score was 17/30.  He did not know the year, season, or day of the week nor did he know the building or specialty or the floor.  There was a tendency for perseveration during the evaluation.  He could not copy the diagram of intersecting pentagons.,Cranial Nerve Exam:  No evidence of papilledema.  The pupillary light reflex is intact as are extraocular movements without nystagmus, facial expression and sensation, hearing, head turning, tongue, and palate movement.,Motor Exam:  Normal bulk and strength, but the tone is marked by significant paratonia.  There is no atrophy, fasciculations, or drift.  There is tremulousness of the outstretched hands.,Sensory Exam:  Is difficult to interpret.  Either he does not understand the test or he is mostly guessing.,Cerebellar Exam:  Is intact for finger-to-nose, heel-to-knee, and rapid alternating movement tests.  There is no dysarthria.,Reflexes:  Trace in the arms, 2+ at the knees, and 0 at the ankles.  It is not certain whether there is a Babinski sign or simply withdrawal.,Gait:  Assessed using the Tinetti assessment tool that shows a balance score of 7-10/16 and a gait score of 2-5/12 for a total score of 9-15/28, which is significantly impaired.,REVIEW OF X-RAYS: , I personally reviewed the MRI scan of the brain from December 11, 2007 at Advanced Radiology.  It shows the ventricles are enlarged with a frontal horn span of 5.0 cm.  The 3rd ventricle contour is flat.  The span is enlarged at 12 mm.  The sylvian aqueduct is patent.  There is a pulsation artifact.  The corpus callosum is effaced.  There are extensive T2 signal abnormalities that are confluent in the corona radiata.  There are also scattered T2 abnormalities in the basal ganglia.  There is a suggestion of hippocampal atrophy.  There is also a suggestion of vermian atrophy.,ASSESSMENT: , The patient has a clinical syndrome that raises the question of idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus.  His examination today is notable for moderate-to-severe dementia and moderate-to-severe gait impairment.  His MRI scan raises the question of hydrocephalus, however, is also consistent with cerebral small vessel disease.,PROBLEMS/DIAGNOSES:,1.  Possible idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (331.5).,2.  Probable cerebral small-vessel disease (290.40 & 438).,3.  Gait impairment (781.2).,4.  Urinary urgency and incontinence (788.33).,5.

This loose body was then subsequently removed.  It measured 24 x 14 mm.  This was actually the OCD lesion seen on the MRI that had come from the weightbearing surface of just the lateral posterior aspect of the medial femoral condyle,HISTORY AND PHYSICAL: , The patient is 13-year-old male with persistent left knee pain.  He was initially seen at Sierra Pacific Orthopedic Group where an MRI demonstrated unstable OCD lesion of the left knee.  The patient presented here for a second opinion.  Surgery was recommended grossly due to the instability of the fragment.  Risks and benefits of surgery were discussed.  The risks of surgery include risk of anesthesia, infection, bleeding, changes in sensation and motion extremity, failure to relieve pain or restore the articular cartilage, possible need for other surgical procedures, and possible early arthritis.  All questions were answered and parents agreed to the above plan.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was taken to the operating room and placed supine on the operating table.  General anesthesia was then administered.  The patient received Ancef preoperatively.  A nonsterile tourniquet was placed on the upper aspect of the patient's left thigh.  The extremity was then prepped and draped in standard surgical fashion.  The standard portals were marked on the skin.  The extremity was wrapped in Esmarch prior to inflation of tourniquet to 250 mmHg.  The portal incisions were then made by an #11 blade.  Camera was inserted into the lateral joint line.  There was a noted large cartilage loose body in the suprapatellar pouch.  This was subsequently removed with extension of the anterolateral portal.  Visualization of the rest of the knee revealed significant synovitis.  The patient had a large cartilage defect in the posterolateral aspect of the medial femoral condyle.  The remainder of the knee demonstrated no other significant cartilage lesions, loose bodies, plica or meniscal pathology.  ACL was also visualized to be intact in the intracondylar notch.,Attention was then turned back to the large defect.  The loose cartilage was debrided using a shaver.  Microfracture technique was then performed to 4 mm depth at 2 to 3 mm distances.  Tourniquet was released at the end of the case to ensure that there was fat and bleeding at the microfracture sites.  All instruments were then removed.  The portals were closed using #4-0 Monocryl.  A total of 30 mL of 0.5% Marcaine was injected into the knee.  Wounds were then cleaned and dried, and dressed in Steri-Strips, Xeroform, 4 x 4s, and bias.  The patient was then placed in a knee immobilizer.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  The tourniquet was released at 37 minutes.  He was taken to recovery in stable condition.,POSTOPERATIVE PLAN: , The loose cartilage fragment was given to the family.  The intraoperative findings were relayed with intraoperative photos.  There was a large deficit in the weightbearing portion of medial femoral condyle.  His prognosis is guarded given the fact of the fragile lesion and location, but in advantages of his age and his rehab potential down the road, if the patient still has symptoms, he may be a candidate for osteochondral autograft, a procedure which is not performed at Children's or possible cartilaginous transplant.  All questions were answered.  The patient will follow up in 10 days, may wet the wound in 5 days.\",\n",

With each stage, a thin layer of tumor-laden tissue was excised with a narrow margin of normal appearing skin, using the Mohs fresh tissue technique.  A map was prepared to correspond to the area of skin from which it was excised.  The tissue was prepared for the cryostat and sectioned.  Each section was coded, cut and stained for microscopic examination.  The entire base and margins of the excised piece of tissue were examined by the surgeon.  Areas noted to be positive on the previous stage (if applicable) were removed with the Mohs technique and processed for analysis.,No tumor was identified after the final stage of microscopically controlled surgery.  The patient tolerated the procedure well without any complication.  After discussion with the patient regarding the various options, the best closure option for each defect was selected for optimal functional and cosmetic results.',\n",

According to the patient and the daughter who was with her, she was shopping when she felt abdominal discomfort with nausea, profuse sweating, and passed out.  As soon as she was laid on the floor and her leg raised up, she woke up with no post-event confusion.  According to the daughter, she has had episodes of weakness, but no syncope.  She has blood pressure medications and has had some postural hypotensions, which has been managed by Dr. X.

       " \"PROCEDURE PERFORMED: , Nissen fundoplication.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: , After informed consent was obtained detailing the risks of infection, bleeding, esophageal perforation and death, the patient was brought to the operative suite and placed supine on the operating room table.  General endotracheal anesthesia was induced without incident.  The patient was then placed in a modified lithotomy position taking great care to pad all extremities.  TEDs and Venodynes were placed as prophylaxis against deep venous thrombosis.  Antibiotics were given for prophylaxis against surgical infection.,A 52-French bougie was placed in the proximal esophagus by Anesthesia, above the cardioesophageal junction.  A 2 cm midline incision was made at the junction of the upper two-thirds and lower one-third between the umbilicus and the xiphoid process.  The fascia was then cleared of subcutaneous tissue using a tonsil clamp.  A 1-2 cm incision was then made in the fascia gaining entry into the abdominal cavity without incident.  Two sutures of 0 Vicryl were then placed superiorly and inferiorly in the fascia, and then tied to the special 12 mm Hasson trocar fitted with a funnel-shaped adaptor in order to occlude the fascial opening.  Pneumoperitoneum was then established using carbon dioxide insufflation to a steady state of pressure of 16 mmHg.  A 30-degree laparoscope was inserted through this port and used to guide the remaining trocars.,The remaining trocars were then placed into the abdomen taking care to make the incisions along Langer's line, spreading the subcutaneous tissue with a tonsil clamp, and confirming the entry site by depressing the abdominal wall prior to insertion of the trocar.  A total of 4 other 10/11 mm trocars were placed.  Under direct vision 1 was inserted in the right upper quadrant at the midclavicular line, at a right supraumbilical position; another at the left upper quadrant at the midclavicular line, at a left supraumbilical position; 1 under the right costal margin in the anterior axillary line; and another laterally under the left costal margin on the anterior axillary line.  All of the trocars were placed without difficulty.  The patient was then placed in reverse Trendelenburg position.,The triangular ligament was taken down sharply, and the left lobe of the liver was retracted superolaterally using a fan retractor placed through the right lateral cannula.  The gastrohepatic ligament was then identified and incised in an avascular plane.  The dissection was carried anteromedially onto the phrenoesophageal membrane.  The phrenoesophageal membrane was divided on the anterior aspect of the hiatal orifice.  This incision was extended to the right to allow identification of the right crus.  Then along the inner side of the crus, the right esophageal wall was freed by dissecting the cleavage plane.,The liberation of the posterior aspect of the esophagus was started by extending the dissection the length of the right diaphragmatic crus.  The pars flaccida of the lesser omentum was opened, preserving the hepatic branches of the vagus nerve.  This allowed free access to the crura, left and right, and the right posterior aspect of the esophagus, and the posterior vagus nerve.,Attention was next turned to the left anterolateral aspect of the esophagus.  At its left border, the left crus was identified.  The dissection plane between it and the left aspect of the esophagus was freed.  The gastrophrenic ligament was incised, beginning the mobilization of the gastric pouch.  By dissecting the intramediastinal portion of the esophagus, we elongated the intra-abdominal segment of the esophagus and reduced the hiatal hernia.,The next step consisted of mobilization of the gastric pouch.  This required ligation and division of the gastrosplenic ligament and several short gastric vessels using the harmonic scalpel.  This dissection started on the stomach at the point where the vessels of the greater curvature turned towards the spleen, away from the gastroepiploic arcade.  The esophagus was lifted by a Babcock inserted through the left upper quadrant port.  Careful dissection of the mesoesophagus and the left crus revealed a cleavage plane between the crus and the posterior gastric wall.  Confirmation of having opened the correct plane was obtained by visualizing the spleen behind the esophagus.  A one-half inch Penrose drain was inserted around the esophagus and sewn to itself in order to facilitate retraction of the distal esophagus.  The retroesophageal channel was enlarged to allow easy passage of the antireflux valve.,The 52-French bougie was then carefully lowered into the proximal stomach, and the hiatal orifice was repaired.  Two interrupted 0 silk sutures were placed in the diaphragmatic crura to close the orifice.,The last part of the operation consisted of the passage and fixation of the antireflux valve.  With anterior retraction on the esophagus using the Penrose drain, a Babcock was passed behind the esophagus, from right to left.  It was used to grab the gastric pouch to the left of the esophagus and to pull it behind, forming the wrap.  The,52-French bougie was used to calibrate the external ring.  Marcaine 0.5% was injected 1 fingerbreadth anterior to the anterior superior iliac spine and around the wound for postanesthetic pain control.  The skin incision was approximated with skin staples.  A dressing was then applied.  All surgical counts were reported as correct.,Having tolerated the procedure well, the patient was subsequently taken to the recovery room in good and stable condition.\",\n",
       " \"HISTORY: , Neurologic consultation was requested to assess and assist with her seizure medication.  The patient is a 3-year 3 months old girl with refractory epilepsy.  She had been previously followed by XYZ, but has been under the care of the UCSF epilepsy program and recently by Dr. Y.  I reviewed her pertinent previous neurology evaluations at CHCC and also interviewed mom.,The patient had seizure breakthrough in August 2007, which requires inpatient admission, Thanksgiving and then after that time had seizures every other day, up-to-date early December.  She remained seizure-free until 12/25/2007 when she had a breakthrough seizure at home treated with Diastat.  She presented to our ER today with prolonged convulsive seizure despite receiving 20 mg of Diastat at home.  Mom documented 103 temperature at home.  In the ER, this was 101 to 102 degrees Fahrenheit.  I reviewed the ER notes.  At 0754 hours, she was having intermittent generalized tonic-clonic seizures despite receiving a total of 1.5 mg of lorazepam x5.  UCSF fellow was contacted.  She was given additional fosphenytoin and had a total dose of 15 mg/kg administered.  Vital weight was 27.  Seizures apparently had stopped.  The valproic acid level obtained at 0835 hours was 79.  According to mom, her last dose was at 6 p.m. and she did not receive her morning dose.  Other labs slightly showed leukocytosis with white blood cell count 21,000 and normal CMP.,Previous workup here showed an EEG on 2005, which showed a left posterior focus.  MRI on June 2007 and January 2005 were within normal limits.  Mom describes the following seizure types:,1.  Eye blinking with unresponsiveness.,2.  Staring off to one side.,3.  Focal motor activity in one arm and recently generalized tonic seizure.,She also said that she was supposed to see Dr. Y this Friday, but had postponed it to some subsequent time when results of genetic testing would be available.  She was being to physicians' care as Dr. Z had previously being following her last UCSF.,She had failed most of the first and second line anti-epileptic drugs.  These include Keppra, Lamictal, Trileptal, phenytoin and phenobarbital.  These are elicited to allergies, but she has not had any true allergic reactions to these.  Actually, it has resulted in an allergic reaction resulting in rash and hypotension.,She also had been treated with Clobazam.  Her best control is with her current regimen of valproic acid and Tranxene.  Other attempts to taper Topamax, but this resulted increased seizures.  She also has oligohidrosis during this summertime.,CURRENT MEDICATIONS: , Include Diastat 20 mg; Topamax 25 mg b.i.d., which is 3.3 per kilo per day; Tranxene 15 mg b.i.d.; Depakote 125 mg t.i.d., which is 25 per kilo per day.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,VITAL SIGNS:  Weight 15 kg.,GENERAL:  The patient was awake, she appeared sedated and postictal.,NECK:  Supple.,NEUROLOGICAL:  She had a few brief myoclonic jerks of her legs during drowsiness, but otherwise no overt seizure, no seizure activity nor involuntary movements were observed.,She was able to follow commands such as when I request that she gave mom a kiss.  She acknowledged her doll.  Left fundus is sharp.  She resisted the rest of the exam.  There was no obvious lateralized findings.,ASSESSMENT:,  Status epilepticus resolved.  Triggered by a febrile illness, possibly viral.  Refractory remote symptomatic partial epilepsy.,IMPRESSION: , I discussed the maximizing Depakote to mom and she concurred.  I recommend increasing her maintenance dose to one in the morning, one in the day, and two at bedtime.  For today, she did give an IV Depacon 250 mg and the above dosage can be continued IV until she is taking p.o.  Dr. X agreed with the changes and orders were written for this.  She can continue her current doses of Topamax and Tranxene.  This can be given by NG if needed.  Topamax can be potentially increased to 25 mg in the morning and 50 mg at night.  I will be available as needed during the rest of her hospitalization.  Mom will call contact Dr. Y an update him about the recent changes.\",\n",

She has failed conservative measures and sought operative intervention for relief of her symptoms.  For details of workup, please see the dictated operative report.,DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION:  ,Appropriate informed consent was obtained and the patient was taken to the operating room and placed under general anesthetic.  She was placed in a position of comfort on the operating table with all bony prominences and soft tissues well padded and protected.  Second check was made prior to prepping and draping.  Following this, we did needle localization with reviews of AP and lateral multiple times to make sure we had the T8-T9 level.  We then made an approach through a midline incision and came out over the pars.  We dissected down carefully to identify the pars.  We then went on the outside of the pars and identified the foramen and then we took another series of x-rays to confirm the T8-T9 level.  We did this under live fluoroscopy.  We confirmed T8-T9 and then went ahead and took a Midas Rex and removed the superior portion of the pedicle overlying the outside of the disc and then worked our way downward removing portion of the transverse process as well.  We found the edge of the disc and then worked our way and we were able to remove some of the disc material but then decided to go ahead and take down the pars.  The pars was then drilled out.  We identified the disc even further and found the disc herniation material that was under the spinal cord.  We then took a combination of small pituitaries and removed the disc material without difficulty.  Once we had disc material out, we went ahead and made a small cruciate incision in the disc space and entered the disc space in earnest removing more disc material making sure there is nothing free to herniate further.  Once we had done that, we inspected up by the nerve root, found some more disc material there and removed that as well.  We could trace the nerve root out freely and easily.  We made sure there was no evidence of further disc material.  We used an Epstein curette and placed a nerve hook under the nerve root.  The Epstein curette removed some more disc material.  Once we had done this, we were satisfied with the decompression.  We irrigated the wound copiously to make sure there is no further disc material and then ready for closure.  We did place some steroid over the nerve root and readied for closure.  Hemostasis was meticulous.  The wound was closed with #1 Vicryl suture for the fascial layer, 2 Vicryl suture for the skin, and Monocryl and Steri-Strips applied.  Dressing was applied.  The patient was awoken from anesthesia and taken to the recovery room in stable condition.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:,  150 mL.,COMPLICATIONS: , None.,DISPOSITION:,  To PACU in stable condition having tolerated the procedure well, to mobilize routinely when she is comfortable to go to her home.',\n",

The patient experienced an unexplained cardiac arrest at the completion of the procedure, which required institution of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for more than two hours following discontinuation of cardiopulmonary bypass.  The patient has been successfully resuscitated with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and was decannulated 48 hours ago.  She did not meet the criteria for delayed primary chest closure.,PREOP DIAGNOSIS: , Open chest status post modified stage I Norwood procedure.,POSTOP DIAGNOSIS: , Open chest status post modified stage I Norwood procedure.,ANESTHESIA:,  General endotracheal.,COMPLICATIONS:,  None.,FINDINGS: , No evidence of intramediastinal purulence or hematoma.  At completion of the procedure no major changes in hemodynamic performance.,DETAILS OF THE PROCEDURE: , After obtaining informed consent, the patient was brought to the room, placed on the operating room table in supine position.  Following the administration of general endotracheal anesthesia, the chest was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion and all the chest drains were removed.  The chest was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion and previously placed segmental AlloDerm was removed.  The mediastinum was then thoroughly irrigated with diluted antibiotic irrigation and both pleural cavities suctioned.  Through a separate incision and another 15-French Blake drain was inserted and small titanium clips were utilized to mark the rightward aspect of the RV-PA connection as well as inferior most aspect of the ventriculotomy.  The pleural spaces were opened widely and the sternum was then spilled with vancomycin paste and closed the sternum with steel wires.  The subcutaneous tissue and skin were closed in layers.  There was no evidence of significant increase in central venous pressure or desaturation.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  Sponge and needle counts were correct times 2 at the end of the procedure.  The patient was transferred to the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit shortly thereafter in critical but stable condition.,I was the surgical attending present in the operating room in charge of the surgical  procedure throughout the entire length of the case.',\n",

His previous PSAs were in the 1 range.  TRUS biopsy revealed 4+3 Gleason score prostate cancer with a large tumor burden.  After extensive counseling, the patient elected for retropubic radical prostatectomy.  Given his disease burden, it was advised that an open prostatectomy is probably the standard of care to ensure entire excision.  The patient consented and agreed to proceed forward.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: , The patient was brought to the operating room here.  Time out was taken to properly identify the patient and procedure going to be done.  General anesthesia was induced.  The patient was placed in the supine position.  The bed was flexed distant to the pubic area.  The patient's lower abdominal area, pubic area, and penile and scrotal area were clipped, and then scrubbed with Hibiclens soap for three minutes.  The patient was then prepped and draped in normal sterile fashion.  Foley catheter was inserted sterilely in the field.  Preoperative antibiotics were given within 30 minutes of skin incision.  A 10 cm lower abdominal incision was made from the symphysis pubis towards the umbilicus.  Dissection was taken down through Scarpa's fascia to the level of the anterior rectus sheath.  The rectus sheath was then incised and the muscle was split in the middle.  Space of rectus sheath was then entered.  The Bookwalter ring was then applied to the belly, and the bladder was then retracted to the right side, thus exposing the left obturator area.  The lymph node packet on the left side was then dissected.  This was done in a split and roll fashion with the flimsy tissue, and the left external iliac vein was incised, and the tissues were then rolled over the left external iliac vein.  Dissection was carried down from the left external iliac vein to the obturator nerve and up to the level of the pelvic sidewall.  The proximal extent of dissection was the left hypogastric artery to the level of the node of Cloquet distally.  Care was taken to avoid injury to the nerves.  An accessory obturator vein was noted and was ligated.  The same procedure was done on the right side with dissection of the right obturator lymph node packet, which was sent for pathologic evaluation.  The bladder subsequently was retracted cephalad.  The prostate was then defatted up to the level of the endopelvic fascia.  The endopelvic fascia was then incised bilaterally, and the incision was then taken to the level of the puboprostatic ligaments.  Vicryl stitch was then applied at the level of the bladder neck in order to control the bladder back bleeders.  A Babcock was then applied around the dorsal venous complex over the urethra and the K-wire was then passed between the dorsal vein complex and the urethra by passing by the aid of a right angle.  A 0-Vicryl stitch was then applied over the dorsal venous complex, which was then tied down and cinched to the symphysis pubis.  Using a knife on a long handle, the dorsal venous complex was then incised using the K-wire as a guide.  Following the incision of the dorsal venous complex, the anterior urethra was then incised, thus exposing the Foley catheter.  The 3-0 Monocryl sutures were then applied going outside in on the anterior aspect of the urethra.  The lateral edges of the urethra were also then incised, and two lateral stitches were also applied going outside end.  The catheter was then drawn back at the level of membranous urethra, and a final posterior stitch was applied going outside end.  The urethra was subsequently divided in its entirety.  A Foley catheter was then taken out and was inserted directly into the bladder through the prostatic apex.  The prostate was then entered cephalad, and the prostatic pedicles were then systematically taken down with the right angle clips and cut.  Please note that throughout the case, the patient was noted to have significant oozing and bleeding partially from the dorsal venous complex, pelvic veins, and extensive vascularity that was noted in the patient's pelvic fatty tissue.  Throughout the case, the bleeding was controlled with the aid of a clips, Vicryl sutures, silk sutures, and ties, direct pressure packing, and FloSeal.  Following the excision of the prostatic pedicles, the posterior dissection at this point was almost complete.  Please note that the dissection was relatively technically challenging due to extensive adhesions between the prostate and Denonvilliers' fascia.  The seminal vesicle on the left side was dissected in its entirety; however, the seminal vesicle on the right side was adherently stuck to the Denonvilliers' fascia, which prompted the excision of most of the right seminal vesicle with the exception of the tip.  Care was taken throughout the posterior dissection to preserve the integrity of the ureters.  The anterior bladder neck was then cut anteriorly, and the bladder neck was separated from the prostate.  Following the dissection, the 5-French feeding tubes were inserted bilaterally into the ureters thus insuring their integrity.  Following the dissection of the bladder from the prostate, the prostate at this point was mobile and was sent for pathological evaluation.  The bladder neck was then repaired using Vicryl in a tennis racquet fashion.  The rest of the mucosa was then everted.  The ureteral orifices and ureters were protected throughout the procedure.  At this point, the initial sutures that were applied into the urethra were then applied into the corresponding position on the bladder neck, and the bladder neck was then cinched down and tied down after a new Foley catheter was inserted through the penile meatus and into the bladder pulling the bladder in position.  Hemostasis was then adequately obtained.  FloSeal was applied to the pelvis.  The bladder was then irrigated.  It was draining pink urine.  The wound was copiously irrigated.  The fascia was then closed using a #1 looped PDS.  The skin wound was then irrigated, and the skin was closed with a 4-0 Monocryl in subcuticular fashion.  At this point, the procedure was terminated with no complications.  The patient was then extubated in the operating room and taken in stable condition to the PACU.  Please note that during the case about 3600 mL of blood was noted.  This was due to the persistent continuous oozing from vascular fatty tissue and pelvic veins as previously noted in the dictation.\",\n",
       " 'PROCEDURE PERFORMED: , Phacoemulsification with intraocular lens placement.,ANESTHESIA TYPE:  ,Topical.,COMPLICATIONS: , None.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was brought to the operating room after the eye was dilated with topical Mydriacyl and Neo-Synephrine eye drops.  Topical anesthetic drops were applied to the eye just prior to entering the operating room.  The eye was then prepped with a 5% Betadine solution injected in the usual sterile fashion.  A wire speculum was placed in the eye and then a clear corneal paracentesis site was made inferiorly with a 15-degree blade.  Lidocaine 1% preservative-free, 0.1 cc, was instilled into the anterior chamber through the clear corneal paracentesis site and this was followed with viscoelastic to fill the chamber.  A 2.8-mm keratome was used to create a self-sealing corneal incision temporally and then a bent capsulotomy needle was used to create an anterior capsular flap.  The Utrata forceps were used to complete a continuous tear capsulorrhexis, and hydrodissection and hydrodelineation of the nucleus was performed with BSS on a cannula.  Phacoemulsification in a quartering and cracking technique was used to remove the nucleus, and then the residual cortex was removed with the irrigation and aspiration unit.  Gentle vacuuming of the central posterior capsule was performed with the irrigation and aspiration unit.  The capsular bag was re-expanded with viscoelastic, and then the wound was opened to a 3.4-mm size to accommodate the intraocular lens insertion using an additional keratome blade.,The lens was folded, inserted into the capsular bag and then unfolded.  The trailing haptic was tucked underneath the anterior capsular rim.  The lens was shown to center very well.  The viscoelastic was removed with the irrigation and aspiration unit and one 10-0 nylon suture was placed across the incision after Miochol was injected into the anterior chamber to cause pupillary constriction.  The wound was shown to be watertight.  Therefore, TobraDex ointment was applied to the eye, an eye pad loosely applied, and a Fox shield taped firmly in place over the eye.,The patient tolerated the procedure well and left the operating room in good condition.',\n",

She subsequently actually done reasonably well until about a month ago when she developed progressive severe intractable pain.  Imaging study showed that the distal hardware at the plate itself had fractured consistent with incomplete fusion across her osteomyelitis area.  There was no evidence of infection on the imaging or with her laboratory studies.  In addition, she developed a pretty profound stenosis at L4-L5 and L5-S1 that appeared to be recurrent as well.  She now presents for revision of her hardware, extension of fusion, and decompression.,The patient was brought to the operating room, placed under satisfactory general endotracheal anesthesia.  She was placed on the operative table in the prone position.  Back was prepared with Betadine, iodine, and alcohol.  We elliptically excised her old incision and extended this caudally so that we had access from the existing hardware fixation all the way down to her sacrum.  The locking nuts were removed from the screw post and both plates refractured or significantly weakened and had a crease in it.  After these were removed, it was obvious that the bottom screws were somewhat loosened in the pedicle zone so we actually tightened one up and that fit good snugly into the nail when we redirected so that it actually reamed up into the upper aspect of the vertebral body in much more secure purchase.  We then dressed the L4-L5 and L5-S1 levels which were profoundly stenotic.  This was a combination of scar and overgrown bone.  She had previously undergone bilateral hemilaminectomies at L4-5 so we removed scar bone and actually cleaned and significantly decompressed the dura at both of these levels.  After completing this, we inserted the Capstone interbody spacer filled with morselized autograft bone and some BMP sponge into the disk space at both levels.  We used 10 x 32 mm spacers at both L4-L5 and L5-S1.  This corrected the deformity and helped to preserve the correction of the stenosis and then after we cannulated the pedicles of L4, L5 and S1 tightened the pedicle screws in L3.  This allowed us to actually seat a 20 cm plate contoured to the lumbar lordosis onto the pedicle screws all the way from S1 up to the T11 level.  Once we placed the plate onto the screws and locked them in position, we then packed the remaining BMP sponge and morselized autograft bone through the plate around the incomplete fracture healing at the L1 level and then dorsolaterally at L4-L5 and L5-S1 and L3-L4, again the goal being to create a dorsal fusion and enhance the interbody fusion as well.  The wound was then irrigated copiously with bacitracin solution and then we closed in layers using #1 Vicryl in muscle and fascia, 3-0 in subcutaneous tissue and approximated staples in the skin.  Prior to closing the skin, we confirmed correct sponge and needle count.  We placed a drain in the extrafascial space and then confirmed that there were no other foreign bodies.  The Cell Saver blood was recycled and she was given two units of packed red blood cells as well.  I was present for and performed the entire procedure myself or supervised.',\n",

In addition, she complains of a painful right talus bunion to the right foot.  She has tried conservative methods such as wide shoes and serial debridement and accommodative padding, all of which provided inadequate relief.  At this time she desires to attempt a surgical correction.  The risks versus benefits of the procedure have been explained to the patient by Dr. X and the consent is available on the chart for review.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:  ,After IV was established by the Department Of Anesthesia, the patient was taken to the operating room via cart.  She was placed on the operating table in supine position and a safety strap was placed across her waist for retraction.  Next, copious amounts of Webril were applied around the right ankle and a pneumatic ankle tourniquet was applied.,Next, after adequate IV sedation was administered by the Department Of Anesthesia, a total of 10 cc mixture of 4.5 cc of 1% lidocaine/4.5 cc of 0.5% Marcaine/1 cc of Kenalog was injected into the right foot in an infiltrative type block.  Next, the foot was prepped and draped in the usual aseptic fashion.  An Esmarch bandage was used to exsanguinate the foot and the pneumatic ankle tourniquet was elevated to 250 mmHg.  Next, the foot was lowered in the operative field and attention was directed to the dorsal third metatarsal area.  There was a plantar hyperkeratotic lesion and a plantar flex palpable third metatarsal head.  A previous cicatrix was noted with slight hypertrophic scarring.  Using a #10 blade, a lazy S-type incision was created over the dorsal aspect of the third metatarsal, approximately 3.5 cm in length.  Two semi-elliptical converging incisions were made over the hypertrophic scar and it was removed and passed off as a specimen.  Next, the #15 blade was used to deepen the incision down to the subcutaneous tissue.  Any small traversing veins were ligated with electrocautery.  Next, a combination of blunt and sharp dissection were used to undermine the long extensor tendon, which was tacked down with a moderate amount of fibrosis and fibrotic scar tissue.  Next, the extensor tendon was retracted laterally and the deep fascia over the metatarsals was identified.  A linear incision down to bone was made with a #15 blade to the capsuloperiosteal tissues.  Next, the capsuloperiosteal tissues were elevated using a sharp dissection with a #15 blade, off of the third metatarsal.  McGlamry elevator was carefully inserted around the head of the metatarsal and freed and all the plantar adhesions were freed.  A moderate amount of plantar adhesions were encountered.  The third toe was plantar flex and the third metatarsal was delivered into the wound.  Next, a V-shaped osteotomy with an apex distally was created using a sagittal saw.  The metatarsal head was allowed to float.  The wound was flushed with copious amounts of sterile saline.  #3-0 Vicryl was used to close the capsuloperiosteal tissues, which kept the metatarsal head contained.  Next, #4-0 Vicryl was used to close the subcutaneous layer in a simple interrupted suture technique.  Next, #4-0 nylon was used to close the skin in a simple interrupted technique.,Attention was directed to the right fifth metatarsal.  There was a large palpable hypertrophic prominence, which is the area of maximal pain, which the patient complained of preoperatively.  A #10 blade was used to make a 3 cm incision through the skin.  Next, a #15 blade was used to deepen the incision through the subcutaneous tissue.  Next, the medial and lateral aspects were undermined.  The abductor tendon was identified and retracted.  A capsuloperiosteal incision was made with a #15 blade in a linear fashion down to the bone.  The capsuloperiosteal tissues were elevated off the bone with a Freer elevator and a #15 blade.,Next, the sagittal saw was used to resect the large hypertrophic dorsal exostosis.  A reciprocating rasp was used to smooth all bony prominences.  The wound was flushed with copious amount of sterile saline.  #3-0 Vicryl was used to close the capsuloperiosteal tissues.  #4-0 Vicryl was used to close subcutaneous layer with a simple interrupted suture.  Next, #4-0 nylon was used to close the skin in a simple interrupted technique.  Next, attention was directed to the plantar aspect of the third metatarsal where a bursal sac was felt to be palpated under the plantar flex third metatarsal head.  A #15 blade was used to make a small linear incision under the third metatarsal head.  The incision was deepened through the dermal layer and curved hemostats and Metzenbaum scissors were used to undermine the skin from the underlying bursa.  The wound was flushed and two simple interrupted sutures with #4-0 nylon were applied.,Standard postoperative dressing was applied consisting of Xeroform, 4x4s, Kerlix, Kling, and Coban.  The pneumatic ankle tourniquet was released and immediate hyperemic flush was noted to the digits.,A sterile stockinet was placed on the toes just below the knee.  Copious amounts of Webril were placed on all bony prominences.  3 inch and 4 inch fiberglass cast tape was used to create a below the knee well-padded, well-moulded cast.  One was able to insert two fingers to the distal and proximal aspects of the _cast.  The capillary refill time to the digits was less than three seconds after cast application.  The patient tolerated the above anesthesia and procedures without complications.  She was transported via cart to the Postanesthesia Care Unit with vital signs stable and vascular status intact to the right foot.  She was given standard postoperative instructions to rest, ice and elevate her right foot.  She was counseled on smoking cessation.  She was given Vicoprofen #30 1 p.o. q.4-6h p.r.n., pain.  She was given Keflex #30 1 p.o. t.i.d.  She is to follow up with Dr. X on Monday.  She is to be full weightbearing with a cast boot.

After adequate anesthesia via endotracheal intubation, the nose was prepped with Afrin nasal spray.  After this was done, 1% Xylocaine with 100,000 epinephrine was infiltrated in both sides of the septum and the mucoperichondrium.  After this, the sinus endoscope at 25-degrees was then used to examine the nasal cavity in the left nasal cavity and staying lateral to the middle turbinate.  A 45-degree forceps then used to open up the maxillary sinus.  There was some prominent tissue and just superior to this, the anterior ethmoid was opened.  The 45-degree forceps was then used to open the maxillary sinus ostium.  This was enlarged with backbiting rongeur.  After this was done, the tissue found in the ethmoid and maxillary sinus were removed and sent to pathology and labeled as left maxillary sinus mucosa.  After this was done, attention was then turned to the right nasal cavity staying laterally to the middle turbinate.  There was noted to have prominence in the anterior ethmoidal area.  This was then opened with 45-degree forceps.  This mucosa was then removed from the anterior area.  The maxillary sinus ostium was then opened with 45-degree forceps.  Tissue was removed from this area.  This was sent as right maxillary mucosa.  After this, the backbiting rongeur was then used to open up the ostium and enlarge the ostium on the right maxillary sinus.  Protecting the eyes with wet gauze and using KTP laser at 10 watts, the sinus endoscope was used for observation and the submucosal resection was done of both inferior turbinates as well as anterior portion of the middle turbinates bilaterally.  This was to open up to expose the maxillary ostium as well as other sinus ostium to minimize swelling and obstruction.  After this was completed, a septoplasty was performed.  The incision was made with a #15 blade Bard-Parker knife.  The flap was then elevated, overlying the spur that was protruding into the right nasal cavity.  This was excised with a #15 blade Bard-Parker knife.  The tissue was then laid back in position.  After this was laid back in position, the nasal cavity was irrigated with saline solution, suctioned well as well as the oropharynx.  , ,Surgicel with antibiotic ointment was placed in each nostril and sutured outside the nose with 3-0 nylon.

Abdominal aortography.,INDICATIONS:  ,The patient is a 65-year-old gentleman with a history of exertional dyspnea and a cramping-like chest pain.  Thallium scan has been negative.  He is undergoing angiography to determine if his symptoms are due to coronary artery disease.,NARRATIVE:  ,The right groin was sterilely prepped and draped in the usual fashion and the area of the right coronary artery anesthetized with 2% lidocaine.  Constant sedation was obtained using Versed 1 mg and fentanyl 50 mcg.  Received additional Versed and fentanyl during the procedure.  Please refer to the nurses' notes for dosages and timing.,The right femoral artery was entered and a 4-French sheath was placed.  Advancement of the guidewire demonstrated some obstruction at the level of abdominal aorta.  Via the right Judkins catheter, the guidewire was easily infiltrated to the thoracic aorta and over aortic arch.  The right Judkins catheter was advanced to the origin of the right coronary artery where selective angiograms were performed.  This revealed a very high-grade lesion at the proximal right coronary artery.  This catheter was exchanged for a left #4 Judkins catheter which was advanced to the ostium of the left main coronary artery where selective angiograms were performed.,The patient was found to have the above mentioned high-grade lesion in the right coronary artery and a coronary intervention was performed.  A 6-French sheath and a right Judkins guide was placed.  The patient was started on bivalarudin.  A BMW wire was easily placed across the lesion and into the distal right coronary artery.  A 3.0 x 15 mm Voyager balloon was placed and deployed at 10 atmospheres.  The intermediate result was improved with TIMI-3 flow to the terminus of the vessel.  Following this, a 3.0 x 18 mm Xience stent was placed across the lesion and deployed at 17 atmospheres.  This revealed excellent result however at the very distal of the stent there was an area of haziness but no definite dissection.  This was stented with a 3.0 x 8 mm Xience stent deployed again at 17 atmospheres.  Final angiograms revealed excellent result with TIMI-3 flow at the terminus of the right coronary artery and approximately 10% residual stenosis at the worst point of the narrowing.  The guiding catheter was withdrawn over wire and a pigtail was placed.  This was advanced to the abdominal aorta at the area of obstruction and small injection of contrast was given demonstrating that there was a small aneurysm versus a small retrograde dissection in that area with some dye hang up after injection.  The catheter was removed.  The bivalarudin was stopped at the termination of procedure.  A small injection of contrast given through arterial sheath and Angio-Seal was placed without incident.,It should also be noted that an 8-French sheath was placed in the right femoral vein.  This was placed initially as the patient was going to have a right heart catheterization as well because of the dyspnea.,Total contrast media, 205 mL, total fluoroscopy time was 7.5 minutes, X-ray dose, 2666 milligray.,HEMODYNAMICS: , Rhythm was sinus throughout the procedure.  Aortic pressure was 170/81 mmHg.,The right coronary artery is a dominant vessel.  This vessel gives rise to conus branch and two small RV free wall branches and PDA and a small left ventricular branch.  It should be noted that there was competitive flow in the posterior left ventricular branch and that the distal right coronary artery fills via left sided collaterals.  In the proximal right coronary artery, there is a large ulcerative plaque followed immediately by a severe stenosis that is subtotal in severity.  After intervention, there is TIMI-3 flow to the terminus of the right coronary with better fill into the distal right coronary artery and loss of competitive flow.  There was approximately 10% residual stenosis at the worst part of the previous stenosis.,The left main is without disease and trifurcates into a moderate-sized ramus intermedius, the LAD and the circumflex.  The ramus intermedius is free of disease.  The LAD terminates at the LV apex and has elongated area of mild stenosis at its mid segment.  This measures 25% to 30% at its worst point.  The circumflex is a large caliber vessel.  There is a proximal 15% to 20% stenosis and an area of ectasia in the proximal circumflex.  Distally, this circumflex gives rise to a large bifurcating marginal artery and beyond that point, the circumflex is a small vessel within the AV groove.,The aortogram demonstrates eccentric aneurysm formation.  This may represent a small retrograde dissection as well.  There was some dye hang up in the wall.,IMPRESSION,1.  Successful stenting of subtotal stenosis of the proximal coronary artery.,2.  Non-obstructive coronary artery disease in the mid left anterior descending as described above and ectasia of the proximal circumflex coronary artery.,3.

Posterior cervical fusion C4-C5.,3.  Songer wire.,4.  Right iliac bone graft.,TECHNIQUE:  ,The patient was brought to the operating room.  Preoperative evaluations included previous cervical spine surgery.  The patient initially had some relief; however, his left arm pain did recur and gradually got worse.  Repeat studies including myelogram and postspinal CTs revealed some blunting of the nerve root at C4-C5 and C5-C6.  There was also noted to be some annular bulges at C3-C4, and C6-C7.  The CT scan in March revealed that the fusion was not fully solid.  X-rays were done in November including flexion and extension views, it appeared that the fusion was solid.,The patient had been on pain medication.  The patient had undergone several nonoperative treatments.  He was given the option of surgical intervention.  We discussed Botox, I discussed with the patient and posterior cervical decompression.  I explained to the patient this will leave a larger scar on his neck, and that no guarantee would help, there would be more bleeding and more pain from the posterior surgery than it was from the anterior surgery.  If at the time of surgery there was some motion of the C4-C5 level, I would recommend a fusion.  The patient was a smoker and had been advised to quit smoking but has not quit smoking.  I have therefore recommended that he use iliac bone graft.  I explained to the patient that this would give him a scar over the back of the right pelvis and could be a source of chronic pain for the patient for the rest of his life.  Even if this type of bone graft was used, there was no guarantee that it will fuse and he should stop smoking completely.,The patient also was advised that if I did a fusion, I would also use post instrumentation, which was a wire.  The wire would be left permanently.,Even with all these procedures, there was no guarantee that his symptoms would improve.  His numbness, tingling, and weakness could get worse rather than better, his neck pain and arm pain could persist.  He still had some residual bursitis in his left shoulder and this would not be cured by this procedure.  Other procedures may be necessary later.  There is still with a danger of becoming quadriplegic or losing total control of bowel or bladder function.  He could lose total control of his arms or legs and end up in the bed for the rest of his life.  He could develop chronic regional pain syndromes.  He could get difficulty swallowing or eating.  He could have substantial weakness in the arm.  He was advised that he should not undergo the surgery unless the pain is persistent, severe, and unremitting.,He was also offered his records if he would like any other pain medications or seek other treatments, he was advised that Dr. X would continue to prescribe pain medication if he did not wish to proceed with surgery.,He stated he understood all the risks.  He did not wish to get any other treatments.  He said the pain has reached the point that he wished to proceed with surgery.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , In the operating room, he was given general endotracheal anesthesia.,I then carefully rolled the patient on thoracic rolls.  His head was controlled by a horseshoe holder.  The anesthesiologist checked the eye positions to make sure there was no pressure on the orbits and the anesthesiologist continued to check them every 15 minutes.  The arms, the right hip, and the neck was then prepped and draped.  Care was taken to position both arms and both legs.  Pulses were checked.,A midline incision was made through the skin and subcutaneous tissue on the cervical spine.  A loupe magnification and headlamp illumination was used.  Bleeding vessels were cauterized.  Meticulous hemostasis was carried out throughout the procedure.  Gradually and carefully I exposed the spinous process of the C6, C5, and C4.  A lateral view was done after an instrument in place.  This revealed the C6-C7 level.  I therefore did a small laminotomy opening at C4-C5.  I placed an instrument and x-rays confirmed C4-C5 level.,I stripped the muscles from the lamina and then moved them laterally and held with a self-retaining retractor.,Once I identified the level, I then used a bur to thin the lamina of C5.  I used a 1-mm, followed by a 2-mm Kerrison rongeur to carefully remove the lamina off C5 on the left.  I removed some of the superior lamina of C6 and some of the inferior lamina of C4.  This allowed me to visualize the dura and the nerve roots and gradually do neural foraminotomies for both the C5 and C6 nerve roots.  There was some bleeding from the epidural veins and a bipolar cautery was used.  Absolutely no retractors were ever placed in the canal.  There was no retraction.  I was able to place a small probe underneath the nerve root and check the disc spaces to make sure there was no fragments of disc or herniation disc and none were found.,At the end of the procedure, the neuroforamen were widely patent.  The nerve roots had been fully decompressed.,I then checked stability.  There was micromotion at the C4-C5 level.  I therefore elected to proceed with a fusion.,I debrided the interspinous ligament between C4 and C5.  I used a bur to roughen up the surface of the superior portion of the spinous process of C5 and the inferior portion of C4.  Using a small drill, I opened the facet at C4-C5.  I then used a very small curette to clean up the articular cartilage.  I used a bur then to roughen up the lamina at C4-C5.,Attention was turned to the right and left hip, which was also prepped.  An incision made over the iliac crest.  Bleeding vessels were cauterized.  I exposed just the posterior aspect of the crest.  I removed some of the bone and then used the curette to remove cancellous bone.,I placed the Songer wire through the base of the spinous process of C4 and C5.  Drill holes made with a clip.  I then packed cancellous bone between the decorticated spinous process.  I then tightened the Songer wire to the appropriate tension and then cut off the excess wire.,Prior to tightening the wire, I also packed cancellous bone with facet at C4-C5.  I then laid bone upon the decorticated lamina of C4 and C5.,The hip wound was irrigated with bacitracin and Kantrex.  Deep structures were closed with #1 Vicryl, subcutaneous suture and subcuticular tissue was closed.,No drain was placed in the hip.,A drain was left in the posterior cervical spine.  The deep tissues were closed with 0 Vicryl, subcutaneous tissue and skin were then closed.  The patient was taken to the recovery room in good condition.',\n",
       " 'HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , The patient is an 84-year-old woman with a history of hypertension, severe tricuspid regurgitation with mild pulmonary hypertension, mild aortic stenosis, and previously moderate mitral regurgitation although not seen recently and I was asked to perform cardiology consultation for her because there was concern for atrial fibrillation after a fall.  Basically the patient states that yesterday she fell and she is not certain about the circumstances, on her driveway, and on her left side hit a rock.  When she came to the emergency room, she was found to have a rapid atrial tachyarrhythmia, and was put on Cardizem with reportedly heart rate in the 50s, so that was stopped.  Review of EKGs from that time shows what appears to be multifocal atrial tachycardia with followup EKG showing wandering atrial pacemaker.  An ECG this morning showing normal sinus rhythm with frequent APCs.  Her potassium at that time was 3.1.  She does recall having palpitations because of the pain after the fall, but she states she is not having them since and has not had them prior.  She denies any chest pain nor shortness of breath prior to or since the fall.  She states clearly she can walk and she would be able to climb 2 flights of stairs without problems.,PAST CARDIAC HISTORY: , She is followed by Dr. X in our office and has a history of severe tricuspid regurgitation with mild elevation and PA pressure.  On 05/12/08, preserved left and right ventricular systolic function, aortic sclerosis with apparent mild aortic stenosis, and bi-atrial enlargement.  She has previously had a Persantine Myoview nuclear rest-stress test scan completed at ABCD Medical Center in 07/06 that was negative.  She has had significant mitral valve regurgitation in the past being moderate, but on the most recent echocardiogram on 05/12/08, that was not felt to be significant.  She has a history of hypertension and EKGs in our office show normal sinus rhythm with frequent APCs versus wandering atrial pacemaker.  She does have a history of significant hypertension in the past.  She has had dizzy spells and denies clearly any true syncope.  She has had bradycardia in the past from beta-blocker therapy.,MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:,1.  Multivitamin p.o. daily.,2.  Aspirin 325 mg once a day.,3.  Lisinopril 40 mg once a day.,4.

IT IS LISTED THAT TOPROL HAS CAUSED SHORTNESS OF BREATH IN HER OFFICE CHART AND I BELIEVE SHE HAS HAD SIGNIFICANT BRADYCARDIA WITH THAT IN THE PAST.,FAMILY HISTORY:,  She states her brother died of an MI suddenly in his 50s.,SOCIAL HISTORY: , She does not smoke cigarettes, abuse alcohol, nor use any illicit drugs.  She is retired from Morse Chain and delivering newspapers.  She is widowed.  She lives alone but has family members who live either on her property or adjacent to it.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: , She denies a history of stroke, cancer, vomiting of blood, coughing up blood, bright red blood per rectum, bleeding, stomach ulcers.  She does not recall renal calculi, nor cholelithiasis, denies asthma, emphysema, pneumonia, tuberculosis, sleep apnea, home oxygen use.  She does note occasional peripheral edema.  She is not aware of prior history of MI.  She denies diabetes.  She does have a history of GERD.  She notes feeling depressed at times because of living alone.  She denies rheumatologic conditions including psoriasis or lupus.  Remainder of review of systems is negative times 15 except as described above.,PHYSICAL EXAM:  ,Height 5 feet 0 inches, weight 123 pounds, temperature 99.2 degrees Fahrenheit, blood pressure has ranged from 160/87 with pulses recorded at being 144, and currently ranges 101/53 to 147/71, pulse 64, respiratory rate 20, O2 saturation 97%.  On general exam, she is a pleasant elderly woman who is hard of hearing, but is alert and interactive.  HEENT:  Shows cranium is  normocephalic and atraumatic.  She has moist mucosal membranes.  Neck veins were not distended.  There are no carotid bruits.  Lungs:  Clear to auscultation anteriorly without wheezes.  She is relatively immobile because of her left hip fracture.  Cardiac Exam:  S1, S2, regular rate, frequent ectopic beats, 2/6 systolic ejection murmur, preserved aortic component of the second heart sound.  There is also a soft holosystolic murmur heard.  There is no rub or gallop.  PMI is nondisplaced.  Abdomen is soft and nondistended.  Bowel sounds present.  Extremities without significant clubbing, cyanosis, and there is trivial to 1+ peripheral edema.  Pulses appear grossly intact.  Affect is appropriate.  Visible skin warm and perfused.  She is not able to move because of left hip fracture easily in bed.,DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES/LAB DATA: , Pertinent labs include chest x-ray with radiology report pending but shows only a calcified aortic knob.  No clear pulmonary vascular congestion.  Sodium 140, potassium 3.7, it was 3.1 on admission, chloride 106, bicarbonate 27, BUN 17, creatinine 0.9, glucose 150, magnesium was 2 on 07/13/06.  Troponin was 0.03 followed by 0.18.  INR is 0.93, white blood cell count 10.2, hematocrit 36, platelet count 115,000.,EKGs are reviewed.  Initial EKG done on 08/19/08 at 1832 shows MAT, heart rate of 104 beats per minute, no ischemic changes.  She had a followup EKG done at 20:37 on 08/19/08, which shows wandering atrial pacemaker and some lateral T-wave changes, not significantly changed from prior.  Followup EKG done this morning shows normal sinus rhythm with frequent APCs.,IMPRESSION:  ,She is an 84-year-old female with a history of hypertension, severe tricuspid regurgitation with mild pulmonary hypertension and mild aortic stenosis admitted after a fall with left hip fracture and she will require surgery.  Telemetry now reviewed, shows predominantly normal sinus rhythm with frequent APCs _____ earlier yesterday evening showed burst of multifocal atrial tachycardia and I suspect that was exacerbated by prior hypokalemia, which has been corrected.  There has been no atrial fibrillation documented.  I do not feel these troponins are significant given the stress or fall in prior multifocal atrial tachycardia with increased rate especially in the absence of chest pain or shortness of breath.  She actually describes feeling good exercise capacity prior to this fall.  Given favorable risk to benefit ratio for needed left hip surgery, I feel she may proceed with needed left hip surgery from a cardiac standpoint with continued verapamil, which has been started, which should help control the multifocal atrial tachycardia, which she had and would watch for heart rate with that.  Continued optimization of electrolytes.  The patient cannot take beta-blockers as previously Toprol reportedly caused shortness of breath, although, there was some report that it caused bradycardia so we would watch her heart rate on the verapamil.  The patient is aware of the cardiac risks, certainly it is moderate, and wishes to proceed with needed surgery.  I do not feel any further cardiac evaluation is needed at this time and the patient may followup with Dr. X after discharge.  Regarding her mild thrombocytopenia, I would defer that to hospitalist and continue proton pump inhibitors for history of gastroesophageal reflux disease, management of left hip fracture as per orthopedist.',\n",

After adequate induction of general anesthesia, he was placed in the left lateral decubitus position.  All bony prominences were padded.  The right shoulder was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner using standard Betadine prep, entered through three standard arthroscopic portals anterolateral and posterior incising the skin with a knife using sharp and blunt trocar.,Serial examination of the intraarticular portion of the shoulder showed all the structures to be normal including the biceps tendon ligaments, articular surfaces, and labrum.  Subacromial space was entered.  Visualization was poor due to the hemorrhagic bursitis, and this was resected back.  It was essentially a type-3 acromion, which was converted to a type 1 by aiming the burr anterior from the posterior portal excising the larger anterior spur.  Rotator cuff was little bit fray, but otherwise intact.  Thus, the deep deltoid bursa and the markedly thickened coracoacromial ligament were removed.  The burr was then introduced to the anterior portal and the distal clavicle excision carried out.  The width of burr about 6 mm being careful to preserve the ligaments in the capsule, but removing the spurs and the denuded arthritic joint.,The patient tolerated the procedure very well.  The shoulder was then copiously irrigated, drained free of any residual debris.  The wound was closed with 3-0 Prolene.  Sterile compressive dressing applied.,The patient was then placed on his back in the supine position and the right upper extremity and the left lower extremity were prepped and draped in usual sterile manner using a standard Betadine prep.,The attention was first turned to the right hand where it was elevated, exsanguinated using an Esmarch bandage, and the tourniquet was inflated to 250 mmHg for about 25 minutes.  Volar approach to the carpal ligament was performed incising the skin with a knife and using cautery for hemostasis.  Tenotomy and forceps dissection carried out through the superficial palmar fascia, carried down to the volar carpal ligament, which was then transected sharply with a knife and carried proximal and distal under direct vision using the scissors being careful to avoid the neurovascular structures.,Cautery was used for hemostasis.  The never had an hourglass appearance where it was a kind of constricted as a result of the compression from the ligament, and so a small amount of Celestone was dripped onto the nerve to help quite it down.  The patient tolerated this portion of the procedure very well.  The hand was then irrigated, closed with Monocryl and Prolene, and sterile compressive dressing was applied and the tourniquet deflated.,Attention was then turned to the left knee where it was entered through inferomedial and inferolateral portals incising the skin with a knife and using sharp and blunt trocars.  After entering the knee through inferomedial and inferolateral standard arthroscopic portals, examination of the knee showed a displaced bucket-handle tear in the medial meniscus and a radial tear at the lateral meniscus.  These were resected back to the stable surface using a basket forceps and full-radius shaver.  There was no evidence of any other significant arthritis in the knee.  There was a lot of synovitis, and so after the knee was irrigated out and free of any residual debris, the knee was injected with Celestone and Marcaine with epinephrine.,The patient tolerated the procedure very well, and the wounds were closed with 3-0 Prolene and sterile compressive dressing was applied, and then the patient was taken to the recovery room, extubated, awake, alert, and in stable condition.',\n",

He presented initially to the emergency room with throat and bleeding. Following evaluation by ENT and biopsy, it was determined to be squamous cell carcinoma of the right tonsil and soft palate, The patient is to undergo radiation therapy and possibly chemotherapy and will need prolonged enteral feeding with a bypass route from the mouth. The malignancy was not obstructing. Following obtaining informed consent for percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube with possible conversion to open procedure, we elected to proceed following diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma and election for radiation therapy.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:, The patient was placed in the supine position and general endotracheal anesthesia was induced. Preoperatively, 1 gram of Ancef was given. The abdomen was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. After anesthesia was achieved, an endoscope was placed down into the stomach, and no abnormalities were noted. The stomach was insufflated with air and the endoscope was positioned in the midportion and directed towards the anterior abdominal wall. With the room darkened and intensity turned up on the endoscope, a light reflex was noted on the skin of the abdominal wall in the left upper quadrant at approximately 2 fingerbreadths inferior from the most inferior rib. Finger pressure was applied to the light reflex with adequate indentation on the stomach wall on endoscopy. A 21-gauge 1-1/2 inch needle was initially placed at the margin of the light reflex, and this was done twice. Both times it was not visualized on the endoscopy. At this point, repositioning was made and, again, what was felt to be adequate light reflex was obtained, and the 14-gauge angio catheter was placed. Again, after two attempts, we were unable to visualize the needle in the stomach endoscopically. At this point, decision was made to convert the procedure to an open Stamm gastrostomy.,OPEN STAMM GASTROSTOMY: ,A short upper midline incision was made and deepened through the subcutaneous tissues. Hemostasis was achieved with electrocautery. The linea alba was identified and incised, and the peritoneal cavity was entered. The abdomen was explored. Adhesions were lysed with electrocautery under direct vision. The stomach was identified, and a location on the anterior wall near the greater curvature was selected. After lysis of adhesions was confirmed, we sufficiently moved the original chosen site without tension. A pursestring suture of #3-0 silk was placed on the interior surface of the stomach, and a second #3-0 pursestring silk stitch was placed exterior to that pursestring suture. An incision was then made at the location of the anterior wall which was near the greater curvature and was dissected down to the anterior abdominal wall. A Vanderbilt was used to pass through the abdominal wall in through the skin and then returned to the level of the skin and pulled the Bard feeding tube through the anterior wall into the field. An incision in the center of the pursestring suture on the anterior surface of the stomach was then made with electrocautery. The interior pursestring suture was sutured into place in such a manner as to inkwell the stomach around the catheter. The second outer concentric pursestring suture was then secured as well and tied to further inkwell the stomach. The stomach was then tacked to the anterior abdominal wall at the catheter entrance site with four #2-0 silk sutures in such a manner as to prevent leakage or torsion. The catheter was then secured to the skin with two #2-0 silk sutures. Hemostasis was checked and the peritoneal cavity was washed out and brought to the surgical field. Prior to the initiation of the gastrotomy, the bowel was run and at that time there was noted to be one incidental colotomy. This was oversewn with three #4-0 silk Lembert sutures. At the completion of the operation, the fascia was closed with #1 interrupted Vicryl suture, and the skin was closed with staples. The patient tolerated the procedure well and was taken to the postanesthesia care unit in stable condition.',\n",

She was referred to Dr. X for diagnostic differentiation for possible seizures or other causes of syncope.  The patient reports an extensive neurological history.  Her mother used alcohol during her pregnancy with the patient.  In spite of exposure to alcohol in utero, the patient reported that she achieved \"honors in school\" and \"looked smart.\"  She reported that she began to experience migraines at 11 years of age.  At 15 years of age, she reported that she was thought to have hydrocephalus.  She reported that she will frequently \"bang her head against the wall\" to relieve the pain.  The patient gave birth to her daughter at 17 years of age.  At 18 years of age, she received a spinal tap as a procedure to determine the cause of her severe headaches.  She reported, in 1995 to 1996 she experienced a severe head injury, as she was struck by a car as a pedestrian and \"thrown two and a half city blocks.\"  The patient reported that she could recall before being hit, but could not recall the activities of that same day or the following day.  She reported that she had difficulty walking following this head injury, but received rehabilitation for approximately one month.  Her migraines became more severe following the head injury.  In 1998, she reportedly was experiencing episodes of syncope where she would experience a headache with photophobia, phonophobia, and flashing lights.  Following the syncope episode, she would experience some confusion.  These episodes reportedly were related to her donating plasma.,The patient also reported that her ex-husband stated that she frequently jerked and would shake in her sleep.  She reported that upon awakening, she would feel off balanced and somewhat confused.  These episodes diminished from 2002 to June 2008.  When making dinner, she suddenly dropped and hit the back of her head on refrigerator.  She reported that she was unconscious for five to six minutes.  A second episode occurred on July 20th when she lost consciousness for may be a full day.  She was admitted to Sinai Hospital and assessed by a neurologist.  Her EEG and head CT were considered to be completely normal.  She did not report any typical episodes during the time of her 36-hour EEG.  She reported that her last episode of syncope occurred prior to her being hospitalized.  She stated that she had an aura of her ears ringing, vision being darker and \"tunnel vision\" (vision goes smaller to a pinpoint), and she was \"spazzing out\" on the floor.  During these episodes, she reports that she cannot talk and has difficulty understanding.,The patient also reports that she has experienced some insomnia since she was 6 years old.  She reported that she was a heavy drinker until about 1998 or 1999 and that she would drink a gallon daily of Jack Daniel.  She stopped the use of alcohol and that time she experienced a suicide attempt.  In 2002, she was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and was started on medication.  At the time of the neuropsychological evaluation, she had stopped taking her medicine as she felt that she was now in remission and could manage her symptoms herself.  The patient\\'s medical history is also significant for postpartum depression.,The patient reported that she has been experiencing difficulty with cognitive abilities of attention/concentration, spelling, tangential and slow thinking, poor sequencing memory for events, and variable verbal memory.  She reported that she sometimes has difficulty understanding what people say, specifically she has difficulty understanding jokes.

       " \"PROCEDURE: , Medial branch rhizotomy, lumbosacral.,INFORMED CONSENT:,  The risks, benefits and alternatives of the procedure were discussed with the patient.  The patient was given opportunity to ask questions regarding the procedure, its indications and the associated risks.,The risk of the procedure discussed include infection, bleeding, allergic reaction, dural puncture, headache, nerve injuries, spinal cord injury, and cardiovascular and CNS side effects with possible of vascular entry of medications.  I also informed the patient of potential side effects or reactions to the medications potentially used during the procedure including sedatives, narcotics, nonionic contrast agents, anesthetics, and corticosteroids.,The patient was informed both verbally and in writing.  The patient understood the informed consent and desired to have the procedure performed.,SEDATION: , The patient was given conscious sedation and monitored throughout the procedure.  Oxygenation was given.  The patient's oxygenation and vital signs were closely followed to ensure the safety of the administration of the drugs.,PROCEDURE:  ,The patient remained awake throughout the procedure in order to interact and give feedback.  The x-ray technician was supervised and instructed to operate the fluoroscopy machine.  The patient was placed in the prone position on the treatment table with a pillow under the abdomen to reduce the natural lumbar lordosis.  The skin over and surrounding the treatment area was cleaned with Betadine.  The area was covered with sterile drapes, leaving a small window opening for needle placement.  Fluoroscopy was used to identify the boney landmarks of the spine and the planned needle approach.  The skin, subcutaneous tissue, and muscle within the planned approach were anesthetized with 1% Lidocaine.  With fluoroscopy, a Teflon coated needle, ***, was gently guided into the region of the Medial Branch nerves from the Dorsal Ramus of ***.  Specifically, each needle tip was inserted to the bone at the groove between the transverse process and superior articular process on lumbar vertebra, or for sacral vertebrae at the lateral-superior border of the posterior sacral foramen.  Needle localization was confirmed with AP and lateral radiographs.,The following technique was used to confirm placement at the Medial Branch nerves.  Sensory stimulation was applied to each level at 50 Hz; paresthesias were noted at,*** volts.  Motor stimulation was applied at 2 Hz with 1 millisecond duration; corresponding paraspinal muscle twitching without extremity movement was noted at *** volts.,Following this, the needle Trocar was removed and a syringe containing 1% lidocaine was attached.  At each level, after syringe aspiration with no blood return, 1cc 1% lidocaine was injected to anesthetize the Medial Branch nerve and surrounding tissue.  After completion of each nerve block a lesion was created at that level with a temperature of 85 degrees Celsius for 90 seconds.  All injected medications were preservative free.  Sterile technique was used throughout the procedure.,COMPLICATIONS:,  None.  No complications.,The patient tolerated the procedure well and was sent to the recovery room in good condition.,DISCUSSION: , Post-procedure vital signs and oximetry were stable.  The patient was discharged with instructions to ice the injection site as needed for 15-20 minutes as frequently as twice per hour for the next day and to avoid aggressive activities for 1 day.  The patient was told to resume all medications.  The patient was told to be in relative rest for 1 day but then could resume all normal activities.,The patient was instructed to seek immediate medical attention for shortness of breath, chest pain, fever, chills, increased pain, weakness, sensory or motor changes, or changes in bowel or bladder function.,Follow up appointment was made in approximately 1 week.\",\n",
       " 'HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:,  I was kindly asked to see Ms. ABC who is a 74-year-old woman for cardiology consultation regarding atrial fibrillation and anticoagulation after a fall.,The patient is somnolent at this time, but does arouse, but is unable to provide much history.  By review of the chart, it appears that she fell, which is what she states when she got up out of a rocking chair and could not get herself off the floor.  She states that 1-1/2 hours later she was able to get herself off the floor.,The patient denies any chest pain nor clear shortness of breath.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: , Includes, end-stage renal disease from hypertension.  She follows up with Dr. X in her office and has been known to have a small-to-moderate sized pericardial effusion since 11/07 that has apparently been followed and it appears that the patient was not interested in having diagnostic pericardiocentesis done.  She had an echocardiogram today (please see also that report), which shows stable and small-to-moderate sized pericardial effusion without tamponade, normal left ventricular ejection fraction at 55% with mild concentric left ventricular hypertrophy, mildly dilated right ventricular size, normal right ventricular ejection fraction, moderate mitral regurgitation and severe tricuspid regurgitation with severe pulmonary hypertension, estimated PA systolic pressure of 71 mmHg when compared to the prior echocardiogram done 08/29/07, previously the mitral regurgitation was mild and previously the PA systolic pressure was estimated at 90 mmHg.  Other findings were not significantly changed including pericardial effusion description.  She has a history of longstanding hypertension.  She has been on hemodialysis since 1997 for renal failure, history of mini-strokes documented several years ago, history of seizure disorder, she has a history of right upper extremity edema and right breast enlargement from right subclavian vein occlusion.  She has a history of hypertension, depression, hyperlipidemia, on Sensipar for tertiary hyperparathyroidism.,PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: , Includes, cholecystectomy, post fistula in the left arm, which has failed, and right arm, which is being used including number of operative procedures to the fistula.  She follows up with Dr. Y regarding neurovascular surgery.,MEDICATIONS: , On admission:,1.  Norvasc 10 mg once a day.,2.  Aspirin 81 mg once a day.,3.  Colace 200 mg two at bedtime.,4.

Height is 5 feet 1 inch, weight 147 pounds.  On general exam, she is a pleasant elderly woman who does arouse to voice, but then becomes quite sleepy and apparently that is an improvement from when she was admitted.  HEENT shows the cranium is normocephalic and atraumatic.  She has moist mucosal membranes.  Neck veins are difficult to assess, but do not appear clinically distended.  No carotid bruits.  Lungs are clear to auscultation anteriorly.  No wheezes.  Cardiac exam:  S1, S2 regular rate, 3/6 holosystolic murmur heard with radiation from the left apex towards the left axilla.  No rub, no gallop.  PMI is nondisplaced.  Abdomen:  Soft, nondistended.  CVA is benign.  Extremities with no significant edema.  Pulses appear grossly intact.  She has evidence of right upper extremity edema, which is apparently chronic.,DIAGNOSTIC DATA/LAB DATA: , EKGs are reviewed including from 07/07/09 at 08:31 a.m., which shows atrial fibrillation with left anterior fascicular block, poor R-wave progression when compared to one done on 07/06/09 at 18:25, there is really no significant change.  The atrial fibrillation appears present since at least on EKG done on 11/02/07 and this EKG is not significantly changed from the most recent one.  Echocardiogram results as above.  Chest x-ray shows mild pulmonary vascular congestion.  BNP shows 3788.  Sodium 136, potassium 4.5, chloride 94, bicarbonate 23, BUN 49, creatinine 5.90.  Troponin was 0.40 followed by 0.34.  INR 1.03 on 05/18/07.  White blood cell count 9.4, hematocrit 42, platelet count 139.,IMPRESSION: , Ms. ABC is a 74-year-old woman admitted to the hospital with a fall and she has a history of vascular dementia, so her history is somewhat unreliable it seems and she is somnolent at that time.  She does have chronic atrial fibrillation again documented at least present since 2007 and I found an EKG report by Dr. X, which shows atrial fibrillation on 08/29/07 per her report.  One of the questions we were asked was whether the patient would be a candidate for Coumadin.  Clearly given her history of small mini-strokes, I think Coumadin would be appropriate given this chronic atrial fibrillation, but the main issue is the fall risk.  If not felt to be significant fall risk then I would strongly recommend Coumadin as the patient herself states that she has only fallen twice in the past year.  I would defer that decision to Dr. Z and Dr. XY who know the patient well and it may be that physical therapy consult is appropriate to help adjudicate.,RECOMMENDATIONS:,1.  Fall assessment as per Dr. Z and Dr. XY with possible PT consult if felt appropriate and if the patient is not felt to be at significant fall risk, would put her on Coumadin.  Given her history of small strokes as documented in the chart and her chronic atrial fibrillation, she does have reasonable heart rate control on current labetalol.,2.  The patient has elevated BNP and I suspect that is due to her severe pulmonary hypertension and renal failure and in the light of normal LV function, I would not make any further evaluation of that other than aggressive diuresis.,3.  Regarding this minimal troponin elevation, I do not feel this is a diagnosis especially in the setting of pulmonary hypertension and her small-to-moderate sized stable pericardial effusion again that has been longstanding since 2007 from what I can tell and there is no evidence of tamponade.  I would defer to her usual cardiologist Dr. X whether an outpatient stress evaluation is appropriate for risk stratification.  I did find that the patient had a prior cardiac stress test in 08/07 where they felt that there was some subtle reversibility of the anterior wall, but it was felt that it may be artifact rather than true ischemia with normal LV function seen on that study as well.,4.  Continue Norvasc for history of hypertension as well as labetalol.,5.  The patient is felt to be a significant fall risk and will at least continue her aspirin 81 mg once a day for secondary CVA, thromboprophylaxis (albeit understanding that it is inferior to Coumadin).,6.  Continue Dilantin for history of seizures.',\n",

Once anesthesia was achieved, the right eye was prepped with Betadine, rinsed with saline, and draped in a sterile fashion.  A lid speculum was placed and 4-0 silk sutures passed under the superior and inferior rectus muscles stabilizing the globe.  A fornix-based conjunctival flap was prepared superiorly from 10 to 12 o'clock and episcleral vessels were cauterized using a wet-field.  A surgical groove was applied with a 69 Beaver blade 1 mm posterior to the limbus in a frown configuration in the 10 to 12 o'clock position.  A lamellar dissection was carried anteriorly to clear cornea using a crescent knife.  A stab incision was applied with a Superblade at the 2 o'clock position at the limbus.  The chamber was also entered through the lamellar groove using a 3-mm keratome in a beveled fashion.  Viscoat was injected into the chamber and an anterior capsulorrhexis performed.  Hydrodissection was used to delineate the nucleus and the phacoemulsification tip was inserted into the chamber.  A deep linear groove was dissected through the nucleus vertically and the nucleus was rotated 90 degrees with the assistance of a spatula through the side-port incision.  A second groove was dissected perpendicular to the first and the nucleus was fractured into quadrants.  Each quadrant was emulsified under burst power within the capsular bag.  The epinuclear bowl was manipulated with vacuum, flipped into the iris plane, and emulsified under pulse power.  I&A was used to aspirate cortex from the capsular bag.  A scratcher was used to polish the capsule, and Viscoat was injected inflating the capsular bag and chamber.  The wound was enlarged with a shortcut blade to 5.5 mm.  The intraocular lens was examined, found to be adequate, irrigated with balanced salt, and inserted into the capsular bag.  The lens centralized nicely and Viscoat was removed using the I&A.  Balanced salt was injected through the side-port incision.  The wound was tested, found to be secure, and a single 10-0 nylon suture was applied to the wound with the knot buried within the sclera.  The conjunctiva was pulled over the suture, and Ancef 50 mg and Decadron 4 mg were injected sub-Tenon in the inferonasal and inferotemporal quadrants.

Informed consent was obtained. The patient received IV antibiotics including Ancef and Levaeuin prior to surgery. The patient was brought to the operating room and placud in the supine position, where (s)he wad prepped and draped in the routine fashion. A wire lid speculum was carefully placed to provide exposure. A two-armed 7 mm scleral laceration was seen in the supranasal quadrant. The laceration involved the sclera and the limbus in this area. There was a small amount of iris tissue prolapsed in the wound. The Westcott scissors and 0.12 forceps were used to carefully dissect the conjunctiva away from the wound to provide exposure. A cyclodialysis spatula was used to carefully reposit the prolapsed iris tissue back into the anterior chamber. The anterior chamber remained formed and the iris tissue easily resumed its normal position. The pupil appeared round. An 8-0 nylon suture was used to close the scleral portion of the laceration. Three sutures were placed using the 8-0 nylon suture. Then 9-0 nylon suture was used to close the limbal portion of the wound. After the wound appeared closed, a Superblade was used to create a paracentesis at approximately 2 o'clock. BSS was injected through the paracentesis to fill the anterior chamber. The wound was checked and found to be watertight. No leaks were observed. An 8-0 Vicryl suture was used to reposition the conjunctiva and close the wound. Three 8-0 Vicryl sutures were placed in the conjunctiva. All scleral sutures were completely covered. The anterior chamber remained formed and the pupil remained round and appeared so at the end of the case. Subconjunctival injections of Ancef and dexamethasone were given at the end of the case as well as Tobradex ointment. The lid speculum was carefully removed. The drapes were carefully removed.

Left upper lobectomy.,PROCEDURE DETAILS:  ,With patient in supine position under general anesthesia with endotracheal tube in place, the flexible bronchoscope was then placed down through the endotracheal tube to examine the carina.  The carina was in the midline and sharp.  Moving directly to the right side, the right upper and middle lower lobes were examined and found to be free of obstructions.  Aspiration was carried out for backlog ________ examination.  We then moved to left side, left upper lobe.  There was a tumor mass located in the lingula of the left lobe and left lower lobe found free of obstruction.  No anatomic lesions were demonstrated.  The patient was prepared for left thoracotomy rotated to his right side with a double lumen endotracheal tube in place with an NG tube and a Foley catheter.  After proper position, utilizing Betadine solution, they were draped.  A posterolateral left thoracotomy incision was performed.  Hemostasis was secured with electrocoagulation.  The chest wall muscle was then divided over the sixth rib.  The periosteum of the sixth rib was then removed superiorly and the pleural cavity was entered carefully.  At this time, the mass was felt in the left upper lobe, which measures greater than 3 cm by palpation.  We examined the superior mediastinum.  No lymph nodes were demonstrated as well as in the anterior mediastinum.  Direction was then moved to the fascia where by utilizing sharp and blunt dissection, lingual artery was separated into the left upper lobe.  Casual dissection was carried out with superior segmental arteries and left lower lobe was examined.,Dissection was carried out around the pulmonary artery thus exposing the posterior artery to the left upper lobe.  Direction was carried out to the superior pulmonary vein and utilizing sharp and blunt dissection the entire superior pulmonary vein was separated from the surrounding tissue.  From the top side, the bronchus was then separated away from the pulmonary artery anteriorly, thus exposing the apical posterior artery, which was short.  Tumor mass was close to the artery at this time.  We then directed ourselves once again to the lingual artery which was doubly ligated and cut free.  The posterior artery of the superior branch was doubly ligated and cut free also.  At this time, the bronchus of the left upper lobe was encountered in the fissure on palpation to separate the upper lobe bronchus from lower lobe bronchus and the area was accomplished.  We then moved anteriorly to doubly ligate the pulmonary vein using #00 silk sutures for ligation and a transection #00 silk suture was used to fixate the vein.  Using sharp and blunt dissection, the bronchus through the left upper lobe was freed proximal.  Using the TA 50, the bronchus was then cut free allowing the lung to fall superiorly at which time direction was carried out to the pulmonary artery where the tumor was in close proximity at this time.  A Potts clamp arterial was then placed over the artery and shaving off the tumor and the apical posterior artery was then accomplished.  The anterior artery was seen in the clamp also and was separated and ligated and separated.  At this time, the entire tumor in the left upper lobe was then removed.  ,Direction was carried to the suture where #000 silk was used as a running suture over the pulmonary artery and was here doubly run and tied in place.  The clamp was then removed.  No bleeding was seen at this time.  Lymph nodes were then removed from the sump of the separation between the upper lobe and the lower lobe and sent for separate pathology.  We then carried out incision in the inferior pulmonary ligament up to the pulmonary vein allowing the lung to reexpand to its normal position.  At this time, two chest tubes #28 and #32 were placed anteriorly and posteriorly to fixate the skin using raw silk suture.  The chest cavity was then closed.  After reexamination, no bleeding was seen with three pericostal sutures of #1 chromic double strength.  A #2-0 Polydek was then used to close the chest wall muscle the anterior as well as latissimus dorsi #000 chromic subcutaneous tissue skin clips to the skin.

She underwent 4 compartment fasciotomy with dual incision on medial and lateral aspect of the right lower leg.  She was doing very well and was obviously improving.,The swelling was reduced.  A compartment pressure had obviously improved based on examination.  She was therefore indicated for placement of tissue expander for ventral wound closure.  The risks of procedure as well as alternatives of this procedure were discussed at length with the patient and he understood them well.  Risks and benefits were all discussed, risk of bleeding, infection, damage to blood vessels, damage to nerve roots, need for further surgery, chronic pain with range of motion, risk of continued discomfort, risk of need for further reconstructive procedures, risk of blood clots, pulmonary embolism, myocardial infarction, and risk of death were discussed.  She understood them well.  All questions were answered, and she signed the consent for the procedure as described.,DESCRIPTION OF THE PROCEDURE:,  The patient was placed on the operating table and general anesthesia was achieved.  The medial wound was noted to be approximately 10.5 cm in length x 4 cm.  The lateral wound was noted in approximately 14 cm in length x 5 x 5 cm in width.  Both wounds were then thoroughly debrided.  The debridement of both wounds included skin and subcutaneous tissue and nonviable muscle portion.  This involve very small portion of muscle as well as skin edge and the subcutaneous tissue did require debridement on both sides.  At this point adequate debridement was performed and healthy tissue did appear to be present.  Initially on the medial wound I did place the DermaClose RC continuous external tissue expander.  On the medial wound the 5 skin anchors were placed on each side of the wound and separated appropriately.  I then did place the line loop from the tension controller in a lace like manner through the skin anchors and the tension controller was attached to the middle anchor.  I then did place adequate tension on the sutures.  Continued tension will be noted after engaging the tension controller.  At this point I performed the similar procedure to the lateral wound.  The skin anchors were placed separately and appropriately on either side of the skin margin.  The line loop from the tension controller was placed in lace like manner through the skin anchors.  The tension controller was then attached to the mid anchor and appropriate tension was applied.,It must be noted I did undermine the skin edges both sides of flap from both incision site prior to placement of the skin anchor and adequate mobilization was obtained.  Adequate tension was placed in this region.  A non thick dressing was then applied to the open-wound region and sterile dressing was then applied.  No complications were encountered throughout the procedure and the patient tolerated the procedure well.  The patient was taken to recovery room in stable condition.',\n",

After adequate anesthesia was achieved, a curvilinear incision was made in the right pelvic fossa approximately 9 cm in length extending from the 1.5 cm medial of the ASIS down to the suprapubic space.  After this was taken down with a #10 blade, electrocautery was used to take down tissue down to the layer of the subcutaneous fat.  Camper's and Scarpa's were dissected with electrocautery.  Hemostasis was achieved throughout the tissue plains with electrocautery.  The external oblique aponeurosis was identified with musculature and was entered with electrocautery.  Then hemostats were entered in and dissection continued down with electrocautery down through the external internal obliques and the transversalis fascia.  Additionally, the rectus sheath was entered in a linear fashion.  After these planes were entered using electrocautery, the retroperitoneum was dissected free from the transversalis fascia using blunt dissection.  After the peritoneum and peritoneal structures were moved medially and superiorly by blunt dissection, the dissection continued down bluntly throughout the tissue planes removing some alveolar tissue over the right iliac artery.  Upon entering through the transversalis fascia, the epigastric vessels were identified and doubly ligated and tied with #0 silk ties.  After the ligation of the epigastric vessels, the peritoneum was bluntly dissected and all peritoneal structures were bluntly dissected to a superior and medial plane.  This was done without any complication and without entering the peritoneum grossly.  The round ligament was identified and doubly ligated at this time with #0 silk ties as well.  The dissection continued down now to layer of the alveolar tissue covering the right iliac artery.  This alveolar tissue was cleared using blunt dissection as well as electrocautery.  After the external iliac artery was identified, it was cleared circumferentially all the way around and noted to have good flow and had good arterial texture.  The right iliac vein was then identified, and this was cleared again using electrocautery and blunt dissection.  After the right iliac vein was identified and cleared off all the alveolar tissue, it was circumferentially cleared as well.  An additional perforating branch was noted at the inferior pole of the right iliac vein.  This was tied with a #0 silk tie and secured.  Hemostasis was achieved at this time and the tie had adequate control.  The dissection continued down and identified all other vital structures in this area.  Careful preservation of all vital structures was carried out throughout the dissection.  At this time, Satinsky clamp was placed over the right iliac vein.  This was then opened using a #11 blade, approximately 1 cm in length.  The heparinized saline was placed and irrigated throughout the inside of the vein, and the kidney was pulled into the abdominal field still covered in its protective socking with the superior pole marked.  The renal vein was then elevated and identified in this area.  A 5-0 double-ended Prolene stitch was used to secure the renal vein, both superiorly and inferiorly, and after appropriately being secured with 5-0 Prolene, these were tied down and secured.  The renal vein was then anastomosed to the right iliac vein in a circumferential manner in a running fashion until secured at both superior and inferior poles.  The dissection then continued down and the iliac artery was then anastomosed to the renal artery at this time using a similar method with 5-0 Prolene securing both superior and inferior poles.  After such time the 5-0 Prolene was run around in a circumferential manner until secured in both superior and inferior poles once again.  After this was done and the artery was secured, the Satinsky clamp was removed and a bulldog placed over.  The flow was then opened on the arterial side and then opened on the venous side to allow for proper flow.  The bulldog was then placed back on the renal vein and allowed for the hyperperfusion of the kidney.  The kidney pinked up nicely and had a good appearance to it and had appearance of good blood flow.  At this time, all Satinsky clamps were removed and all bulldog clamps were removed.  The dissection then continued down to the layer of the bladder at which time the bladder was identified.  Appropriate area on the dome the bladder was identified for entry.  This was entered using electrocautery and approximately 1 cm length after appropriately sizing and incising of the ureter using the Metzenbaum scissors in a linear fashion.  Before this was done, #0 chromic catgut stitches were placed and secured laterally and inferiorly on the dome of the bladder to elevate the area of the bladder and then the bladder was entered using the electrocautery approximately 1 cm in length.  At this time, a renal stent was placed into the ureter and secured superiorly and the stent was then placed into the bladder and secured as well.  Subsequently, the superior and inferior pole stitches with 5-0 Prolene were used to secure the ureter to the bladder.  This was then run mucosa-to-mucosa in a circumferential manner until secured in both superior and inferior poles once again.  Good flow was noted from the ureter at the time of operation.  Additional Vicryl stitches were used to overlay the musculature in a seromuscular stitch over the dome of the bladder and over the ureter itself.  At this time, an Ethibond stitch was used to make an additional seromuscular closure and rolling of the bladder musculature over the dome and over the anastomosis once again.  This was inspected and noted for proper control.  Irrigation of the bladder revealed that the bladder was appropriately filled and there were no flows and no defects.  At this time, the anastomoses were all inspected, hemostasis was achieved and good closure of the anastomosis was noted at this time.  The kidney was then placed back into its new position in the right pelvic fossa, and the area was once again inspected for hemostasis which was achieved.  A 1-0 Prolene stitch was then used for mass closure of the external, internal, and transversalis fascias and musculature in a running fashion from superior to inferior.  This was secured and knots were dumped.  Subsequently, the area was then checked and inspected for hemostasis which was achieved with electrocautery, and the skin was closed with 4-0 running Monocryl.  The patient tolerated procedure well without evidence of complication, transferred to the Dunn ICU where he was noted to be stable.  Dr. A was present and scrubbed through the entire procedure.\",\n",

She sustained a right open ankle fracture, right femur fracture, right femoral neck fracture, right open knee, and right elbow abrasions.  Given the emergent nature of the right femoral neck fracture and her young age as well as the open fracture, it was decided to proceed with an urgent operative intervention.  The risks of surgery were discussed in detail and the consents were signed.  The operative site was marked.  The patient was taken to the operating room where she was given preoperative clindamycin.  The patient had then general anesthetic performed by anesthesia.,A well-padded side tourniquet was placed.  Attention was turned to the right ankle first.  The large medical laceration was extended and the tissues were debrided.  All dirty of the all injured bone, muscle, and tissues were debrided.  Wound was then copiously irrigated with 8 liters of normal saline.  At this point, the medial malleolus fracture was identified and was reduced.  This was then fixed in with two 4.5 mm cannulated Synthes screws.,Next, the attention was turned to lateral malleolus.  Incision was made over the distal fibula.  It was carried down sharply through the skin in the subcutaneous issues.  Care was taken to preserve the superficial peroneal nerve.  The fracture was identified, and there was noted to be very comminuted distal fibula fracture.  The fracture was reduced and confirmed with fluoroscopy.  A 7 hole Synthes 3.5 mm locking plate was placed.  This was placed in a bridging fashion with three screws above and three screws below the fracture.  Appropriate reduction was confirmed under fluoroscopy.  A cotton test was performed, and the ankle did not open up.  Therefore, it was decided not to proceed with syndesmotic screw.,Next, the patient was then placed in the fracture table and all extremities were well padded.  All prominences were padded.  The right leg was then prepped and draped in usual sterile fashion.  A 2-cm incision was made just distal to the greater trochanter.  This was carried down sharply through the skin to the fascia.  The femur was identified.  The guidewire for a striker Asnis 6.5 mm screw was placed in the appropriate position.  The triangle guide was then used to ensure appropriate triangular formation of the remainder of the screws.  A reduction of the fracture was performed prior to placing all the guide wires.  A single 8 mm Asnis screw was placed inferiorly followed by two 6.5 mm screws superiorly.,Next, the abrasions on the right elbow were copiously irrigated.  The necrotic and dead tissue was removed.  The abrasions did not appear to enter the joints.  They were wrapped with Xeroform 4 x 4 x 4 Kerlix and Ace wrap.,Next, the lacerations of the anterior knee were connected and were extended in the midline.  They were carried down sharply to the skin and the retinacular issues to the joint.  The intercondylar notch was identified.  A guide wire for the striker T2 retrograde nail was placed and localized with fluoroscopy.  The opening reamer was used following the bolted guide wire was then passed.  The femur was then sequentially reamed using the flexible reamers.  A T2 retrograde nail 10 x 340 was then passed.  Two 5 mm distal locking screws and two 5 mm proximal locking screws were then placed.,Prior to reaming and passing the retrograde nail, the knee was copiously irrigated with 8 liters of normal saline.  Any dead tissues in the knee were identified and were debrided using rongeurs and curettes.,The patient was placed in the AO splints for the right ankle.  The wounds were dressed with Xeroform 4 x 4 x 4s and IO band.

Prior cerebrovascular accident.,PROCEDURE PERFORMED:  ,Right carotid endarterectomy with patch angioplasty.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:  ,250 cc.,OPERATIVE FINDINGS: , The common and internal carotid arteries were opened.  A high-grade narrowing was present at the proximal internal carotid and this tapered well to a slightly small diameter internal carotid.  This was repaired with a Dacron patch and the patient tolerated this well under regional anesthetic without need for shunting.,PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was taken to the operating room, placed in supine position, prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner with Betadine solution.  Longitudinal incisions were made along the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid, carried down through subcutaneous fat and fascia.  Hemostasis was obtained with electrocautery.  The platysmal muscle was divided.  The carotid sheath was identified and opened.  The vagus nerve, ansa cervicalis, and hypoglossal nerves were identified and avoided.  The common internal and external carotids were then freed from the surrounding tissue.  At this point, 10,000 units of aqueous heparin were administered and allowed to take effect.  The external and common carotids were then clamped.  The patient's neurological status was evaluated and found to be unchanged from preoperative levels.,Once sufficient time had lapsed, we proceeded with the procedure.  The carotid bulb was opened with a #11 blade and extended with Potts scissors through the very tight lesion into normal internal carotid.  The plaque was then sharply excised proximally and an eversion endarterectomy was performed successfully at the external.  The plaque tapered nicely on the internal and no tacking sutures were necessary.  Heparinized saline was injected and no evidence of flapping or other debris was noted.  The remaining carotid was examined under magnification, which showed no debris of flaps present.  At this point, a Dacron patch was brought on to the field, cut to appropriate length and size, and anastomosed to the artery using #6-0 Prolene in a running fashion.  Prior to the time of last stitch, the internal carotid was back-bled through this.  The last stitch was tied.  Hemostasis was excellent.  The internal was again gently occluded while flow was restored to the common and external carotids for several moments and then flow was restored to the entire system.  At this point, a total of 50 mg of Protamine was administered and allowed to take effect.  Hemostasis was excellent.  The wound was irrigated with antibiotic solution and closed in layers using #3-0 Vicryl and #4-0 undyed Vicryl.  The patient was then taken to the recovery room in satisfactory condition after tolerating the procedure well.  Sponge, needles, and instrument count were correct.

Informed consent was obtained. Patient received several sets of drops in his/her XXX eye including Ocuflox and Ocular. (S)He was taken to the operating room where monitored anesthetic care was initiated. Retrobulbar anesthesia was then administered to the XXX eye using a 50:50 mixture of 2% plain lidocaine and 0.05% Marcaine. The XXX eye was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile ophthalmic fashion. A speculum was placed on the eyelids and microscope was brought into position. A #7-0 Vicryl suture was passed through the superotemporal limbus and traction suture was placed at the superotemporal limbus and the eye was rotated infranasally so as to expose the superotemporal conjunctiva. At this point, smooth forceps and Westcott scissors were used to create a 100-degree superotemporal conjunctival peritomy, approximately 2 mm posterior to the superotemporal limbus. This was then dissected anteriorly to the limbus edge and then posteriorly. Steven scissors were then dissected in a superotemporal quadrant between the superior and lateral rectus muscles to provide good exposure. At this point, we primed the Ahmed valve with a #27 gauge cannula using BSS and it was noted to be patent. We then placed Ahmed valve in the superotemporal subconjunctival recess underneath the subtenon space and this was pushed posteriorly. We then measured with calipers so that it was positioned 9 mm posterior to the limbus. The Ahmed valve was then tacked down with #8-0 nylon suture through both fenestrations. We then applied light cautery to the superotemporal episcleral bed. We placed a paracentesis at the temporal position and inflated the anterior chamber with a small amount of Healon. We then used a #23 gauge needle and entered the superotemporal sclera, approximately 1 mm posterior to the limbus into the anterior chamber away from iris and away from cornea. We then trimmed the tube, beveled up in a 30 degree fashion with Vannas scissors, and introduced the tube through the #23 gauge tract into the anterior chamber so that approximately 2-3 mm of tube was extending into the anterior chamber. We burped some of the Healon out of the anterior chamber and filled it with BSS and we felt that the tube was in good position away from the lens, away from the cornea, and away from the iris. We then tacked down the tubes to the sclera with #8-0 Vicryl suture in a figure-of- eight fashion. The pericardium was soaked in gentamicin. We then folded the pericardium 1x1 cm piece onto itself and then placed it over the tube and this was tacked down in all four quadrants to the sclera with #8-0 nylon suture. At this point, we then re-approximated the conjunctiva to its original position and we closed it with an #8-0 Vicryl suture on a TG needle in a running fashion with interrupted locking bites. We then removed the traction suture. At the end of the case, the pupil was round, the chamber was deep, the tube appeared to be well positioned. The remaining portion of the Healon was burped out of the anterior chamber with BSS and the pressure was felt to be adequate. The speculum was removed. Ocuflox and Maxitrol ointment were placed over the eye. Then, an eye patch and shield were placed over the eye. The patient was awakened and taken to the recovery room in stable condition.',\n",

After adequate insufflation, Veress needle was removed and an 11-mm separator trocar was introduced through the infraumbilical incision into the abdominal cavity.  Through the trocar sheath, the laparoscope was inserted and adequate visualization of the pelvic structures was noted.  At this time, the suprapubic area was injected with 0.25% Marcaine with epinephrine.  A 5-mm skin incision was made and a 5-mm trocar was introduced into the abdominal cavity for instrumentation.  Evaluation of the pelvis revealed the uterus to be slightly enlarged and irregular.  The fallopian tubes have been previously interrupted surgically.  The ovaries appeared normal bilaterally.  The cul-de-sac was clean without evidence of endometriosis, scarring or adhesions.  The ureters were noted to be deep in the pelvis.  At this time, the right cornu was grasped and the right fallopian tube, uteroovarian ligament, and round ligaments were doubly coagulated with bipolar electrocautery and transected without difficulty.  The remainder of the uterine vessels and anterior and posterior leaves of the broad ligament, as well as the cardinal ligament was coagulated and transected in a serial fashion down to level of the uterine artery.  The uterine artery was identified.  It was doubly coagulated with bipolar electrocautery and transected.  A similar procedure was carried out on the left with the left uterine cornu identified.  The left fallopian tube, uteroovarian ligament, and round ligaments were doubly coagulated with bipolar electrocautery and transected.  The remainder of the cardinal ligament, uterine vessels, anterior, and posterior sheaths of the broad ligament were coagulated and transected in a serial manner to the level of the uterine artery.  The uterine artery was identified.  It was doubly coagulated with bipolar electrocautery and transected.  The anterior leaf of the broad ligament was then dissected to the midline bilaterally, establishing a bladder flap with a combination of blunt and sharp dissection.  At this time, attention was made to the vaginal hysterectomy.  The laparoscope was removed and attention was made to the vaginal hysterectomy.  The RUMI cannula was removed and the anterior and posterior leafs of the cervix were grasped with Lahey tenaculum.  A circumferential injection with 0.25% Marcaine with epinephrine was made at the cervicovaginal portio.  A circumferential incision was then made at the cervicovaginal portio.  The anterior and posterior colpotomies were accomplished with a combination of blunt and sharp dissection without difficulty.  The right uterosacral ligament was clamped, transected, and ligated with #0 Vicryl sutures.  The left uterosacral ligament was clamped, transected, and ligated with #0 Vicryl suture.  The parametrial tissue was then clamped bilaterally, transected, and ligated with #0 Vicryl suture bilaterally.  The uterus was then removed and passed off the operative field.  Laparotomy pack was placed into the pelvis.  The pedicles were evaluated.  There was no bleeding noted; therefore, the laparotomy pack was removed.  The uterosacral ligaments were suture fixated into the vaginal cuff angles with #0 Vicryl sutures.  The vaginal cuff was then closed in a running fashion with #0 Vicryl suture.  Hemostasis was noted throughout.  At this time, the laparoscope was reinserted into the abdomen.  The abdomen was reinsufflated.  Evaluation revealed no further bleeding.  Irrigation with sterile water was performed and again no bleeding was noted.  The suprapubic trocar sheath was then removed under laparoscopic visualization.  The laparoscope was removed.  The carbon dioxide was allowed to escape from the abdomen and the infraumbilical trocar sheath was then removed.  The skin incisions were closed with #4-0 Vicryl in subcuticular fashion.  Neosporin and Band-Aid were applied for dressing and the patient was taken to the recovery room in satisfactory condition.  Estimated blood loss was approximately 100 mL.  There were no complications.  The instrument, sponge, and needle counts were correct.',\n",

Once he was anesthetized, the caudal block was placed and IV antibiotics were given.  He was then placed in a supine position and sterilely prepped and draped.  Once he was prepped and draped, we used a straight mosquito clamp and went under the bridges and crushed them, and then excised them with a curved iris and curved tenotomy scissors.  We removed the excessive skin on the shaft skin and on the glans itself.  We then on the ventrum excised the bridge and did a Heinecke-Mikulicz closure with interrupted figure-of-eight and interrupted suture of 5-0 chromic.  Electrocautery was used for hemostasis.  Once this was done, we then used Dermabond tissue adhesive and Surgicel to prevent the bridges from returning again.  IV Toradol was given at the end of procedure.

After obtaining the informed consent, the patient's posterior left chest wall was prepped and draped in usual fashion.  Xylocaine 1% was infiltrated above the seventh intercostal space in the midscapular line.  Initially, I tried to use the thoracentesis set after 1% Xylocaine had been infiltrated, but the needle of the system was just too short to reach the pleural cavity due to the patient's very thick chest wall.  Therefore, I had to use a #18 spinal needle, which I had to use almost in its entire length to reach the fluid.  From then on, I proceeded manually to withdraw 2000 mL of a light milky fluid.,The patient tolerated the procedure fairly well, but almost at the end of it she said that she was feeling like fainting and therefore we carefully withdrew the needle.  At that time, it was getting difficult to withdraw fluid anyway and we allowed her to lie down and after a few minutes the patient was feeling fine.  At any rate, we gave her bolus of 250 mL of normal saline and the patient returned to her room for additional hours of observation.  We then thought that if she was doing fine, then we will send her home.,A chest x-ray was performed after the procedure which showed a dramatic reduction of the amount of pleural fluid and then there was no pneumothorax or no other obvious complications of her procedure.,\",\n",

After excision of neoplasm, there was a separate 1 x 2 cm nodule palpated within the cavity.  This too was excised.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was taken to the operating room, placed in supine position in the operating table.  Intravenous sedation was administered by the Anesthesia Department.  The Kopans wire was trimmed to an appropriate length.  The patient was sterilely prepped and draped in the usual manner.  Local anesthetic consisting of 1% lidocaine and 0.5% Marcaine was injected into the proposed line of incision.  A curvilinear circumareolar incision was then made with a #15 scalpel blade close to the wire.  The wire was stabilized and brought to protrude through the incision.  Skin flaps were then generated with electrocautery.  A generous core tissue was grasped with Allis forceps and excised with electrocautery.  Prior to complete excision, the superior margin was marked with a #2-0 Vicryl suture, which was tied and cut short.  The lateral margin was marked with a #2-0 Vicryl suture, which was tied and cut along.  The posterior margin was marked with a #2-0 Polydek suture, which was tied and cut.,The specimen was then completely excised and sent off the operative field as specimen where specimen mammography confirmed the excision of the mammographically detected neoplasm.  On palpation of the cavity, there was felt to be a second nodule further medial and this was grasped with an Allis forceps and excised with electrocautery and sent off the field as a separate specimen.

A low transverse incision was made down to and through to the rectus sheath.  The rectus sheath was put laterally.  The inferior epigastric arteries were identified bilaterally, doubly clamped and tied with #0 Vicryl sutures.  The rectus muscle was then split transversally and the peritoneum was split transversally as well.  The left adnexal mass was identified and large bowel was attached to the mass and Dr. Zuba from General Surgery dissected the large bowel adhesions and separated them from the adnexal mass.  The ureter was then traced and found to be free of the mass and free of the infundibulopelvic ligament.  The infundibulopelvic ligament was isolated, entered via blunt dissection.

The radiotherapy will be planned using simulation films when the Novoste system catheter markers are placed on either side of the coronary artery injury site.  After this, a calculation will take place to determine the length of time at which the strontium sources will be left in place to deliver an adequate dose given the reference vessel diameter.  The rationale for this treatment is based on radiobiological principles that make this type of therapy more effective than blade atherectomy or laser atherectomy.  The does per fraction is individualized for each patient according to radiobiological principles and reference vessel diameter.  Given that this is a very high dose rate source and the chances of severe acute toxicity such as cardiac ischemia and machine malfunction are present, it is imperative that the patient be followed closely by myself and monitored for ST segment elevation and correct machine function.',\n",

After all bony and soft tissue land marks were identified, a 6 cm longitudinal incision was made paramedial to the Achilles tendon from its insertion proximal.  Careful dissection was then taken down to the level of the peritenon.  Once this was reached, full thickness flaps were performed medially and laterally.  Next, retractor was placed.  All neurovascular structures were protected.  A longitudinal incision was then made in the peritenon and opened up exposing the tendon.  There was noted to be complete rupture of the tendon approximately 4 cm proximal to the insertion point.  The plantar tendon was noted to be intact.  The tendon was debrided at this time of hematoma as well as frayed tendon.  Wound was copiously irrigated and dried.  Most of the ankle appeared that there was sufficient tendon links in order to do a primary repair.  Next #0 PDS on a taper needle was selected and a Krackow stitch was then performed.  Two sutures were then used and tied individually ________ from the tendon.  The tendon came together very well and with a tight connection.  Next, a #2-0 Vicryl suture was then used to close the peritenon over the Achilles tendon.  The wound was once again copiously irrigated and dried.  A #2-0 Vicryl sutures were then used to close the skin and subcutaneous fashion followed by #4-0 suture in the subcuticular closure on the skin.  Steri-Strips were then placed over the wound and the sterile dressing was applied consisting of 4x4s, Kerlix roll, sterile Kerlix and a short length fiberglass cast in a plantar position.

       " 'PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Left carpal tunnel syndrome.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Left carpal tunnel syndrome.,OPERATIONS PERFORMED:,  Endoscopic carpal tunnel release.,ANESTHESIA:,  I.V. sedation and local (1% Lidocaine).,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:,  Zero.,COMPLICATIONS:,  None.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , With the patient under adequate anesthesia, the upper extremity was prepped and draped in a sterile manner.  The arm was exsanguinated.  The tourniquet was elevated at 290 mm/Hg.  Construction lines were made on the left palm to identify the ring ray.  A transverse incision was made in the wrist, between FCR and FCU, one fingerbreadth proximal to the interval between the glabrous skin of the palm and normal forearm skin.  Blunt dissection exposed the antebrachial fascia.  Hemostasis was obtained with bipolar cautery.  A distal-based window in the antebrachial fascia was then fashioned.  Care was taken to protect the underlying contents.  A proximal forearm fasciotomy was performed under direct vision.  A synovial elevator was used to palpate the undersurface of the transverse carpal ligament, and synovium was elevated off this undersurface.  Hamate sounds were then used to palpate the hook of hamate.  The endoscopic instrument was then inserted into the proximal incision.  The transverse carpal ligament was easily visualized through the portal.  Using palmar pressure, the transverse carpal ligament was held against the portal as the instrument was inserted down the transverse carpal ligament to the distal end.,The distal end of the transverse carpal ligament was then identified in the window.  The blade was then elevated, and the endoscopic instrument was withdrawn, dividing the transverse carpal ligament under direct vision.  After complete division o the transverse carpal ligament, the instrument was reinserted.  Radial and ulnar edges of the transverse carpal ligament were identified, and complete release was confirmed.,The wound was then closed with running subcuticular stitch.  Steri-Strips were applied, and sterile dressing was applied over the Steri-Strips.  The tourniquet was deflated.  The patient was awakened from anesthesia and returned to the Recovery Room in satisfactory condition, having tolerated the procedure well.',\n",

The chest pain occurred early Tuesday morning. She was treated with Plavix, Lovenox, etc., and transferred for coronary angiography and possible PCI. The plan was discussed with the patient and all questions answered.,PROCEDURE NOTE:, Following sterile prep and drape, the right groin and instillation of 1% Xylocaine anesthesia, the right femoral artery was percutaneously entered with a single wall puncture. A 6-French sheath inserted. Selective left and right coronary injections performed using Judkins coronary catheters with a 6-French pigtail catheter used to obtain left ventricle pressures, and a left ventriculography. The left pullback pressure. The catheters withdrawn. Sheath injection. Hemostasis obtained with a 6-French Angio-Seal device. She tolerated the procedure well.,Left ventricular end-diastolic pressure equals 25 mmHg post A wave. No aortic valve or systolic gradient on pullback.,ANGIOGRAPHIC FINDINGS:,I. Left coronary artery: The left main coronary artery is,normal. The left anterior descending extends to the apex and has only minor luminal irregularities within the midportion of the vessel. Normal diagonal branches. Normal septal perforator branches. The left circumflex is a nondominant vessel with only minor irregularities with normal obtuse marginal branches.,II. Right coronary artery: The proximal right coronary artery has a focal calcification. There is minor plaque with luminal irregularity in the proximal and midportion of the vessel with no narrowing greater than 10 to 20% at most. The right coronary artery is a dominant system which gives off normal posterior,descending and posterior lateral branches. TIMI 3 flow is present.,III. Left ventriculogram: The left ventricle is slightly enlarged with normal contraction of the base, but, with wall motion abnormality involving the anteroapical and inferoapical left ventricle with hypokinesis within the apical portion. Ejection fraction estimated 40%, 1+ mitral regurgitation (echocardiogram ordered).,DISCUSSION:, Recent inferoapical mild myocardial infarction by left ventriculography and cardiac enzymes with elevated left ventricular end-diastolic pressure post A wave, but, only minor residual coronary artery plaque with calcification proximal right coronary artery.,PLAN:, Medical treatment is contemplated, including ACE inhibitor, a beta blocker, aspirin, Plavix, nitrates. An echocardiogram is ordered to exclude apical left ventricular thrombus and to further assess ejection fraction.',\n",

He spontaneously voided without the Foley 110 mL.,ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  ,This is a 66-year-old male with signs and symptoms of benign prostatic hypertrophy, who has had recurrent urinary retention since the kidney transplant in 12/07.  He passed his fill and pull study and was thought to self-catheterize in the event that he does incur urinary retention again.  We discussed with Mr. Barker that he has a urologist closer to his home and he lives approximately 3 hours away; however, he desires to continue follow up with the urology clinic at MCG and has been set up for followup in 6 weeks.  He was also given a prescription for 6 months of Flomax and Proscar.  He did not have a PSA drawn today as he had a catheter in place, therefore his PSA could be falsely elevated.  He will have PSA level drawn either just before his visit for followup.',\n",

Open laparoscopy.,3.  Fulguration of endometrial implant.,ANESTHESIA: , General endotracheal.,BLOOD LOSS: , Minimal.,COMPLICATIONS: , None.,INDICATIONS:  ,The patient is a 21-year-old single female with chronic recurrent pelvic pain unresponsive to both estrogen and progesterone-containing birth control pills, either cyclically or daily as well as progestational medication only, who had a negative GI workup recently including colonoscopy, and desired definitive operative evaluation and diagnosis prior to initiation of a 6-month course of Depo-Lupron.,PROCEDURE: , After an adequate plane of general anesthesia had been obtained, the patient was placed in a dorsal lithotomy position.  She was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion for pelviolabdominal surgery.  Bimanual examination revealed a mid position normal-sized uterus with benign adnexal area.,In the high lithotomy position, a weighted speculum was placed into the posterior vaginal wall.  The anterior lip of the cervix was grasped with a single-tooth tenaculum.  A Hulka tenaculum was placed transcervically.  The other instruments were removed.  A Foley catheter was placed transurethrally to drain the bladder intraoperatively.,In the low lithotomy position and in steep Trendelenburg, attention was turned to the infraumbilical region.  Here, a stab wound incision was made through which the 120 mm Veress needle was placed and approximately 3 L of carbon dioxide used to create a pneumoperitoneum.  The needle was removed, the incision minimally enlarged, and the #5 trocar and cannula were placed.  The trocar was removed and the scope placed confirming a preperitoneal insufflation.,The space was drained off the insufflated gas and 2 more attempts were made, which failed due to the patient's adiposity.  Attention was turned back to the vaginal area where in the high lithotomy position, attempts were made at a posterior vaginal apical insertion.  The Hulka tenaculum was removed, the posterior lip of the cervix grasped with a single-tooth tenaculum, and the long Allis clamp used to grasp the posterior fornix on which was placed traction.  The first short and subsequently 15 cm Veress needles were attempted to be placed, but after several passes, no good pneumoperitoneum could be established via this route also.  It was elected not to do a transcervical intentional uterine perforation, but to return to the umbilical area.  The 15 cm Veress needle was inserted several times, but again a pneumo was preperitoneal.,Finally, an open laparoscopic approach was undertaken.  The skin incision was expanded with a knife blade.  Blunt dissection was used to carry the dissection down to the fascia.  This was grasped with Kocher clamps, entered sharply and opened transversely.  Four 0 Vicryl sutures were placed as stay sutures and tagged with hemostats and needles were cutoff.  Dissection continued between the rectus muscle and finally the anterior peritoneum was reached, grasped, elevated, and entered.,At this juncture, the Hasson cannula was placed and tied snugly with the above stay sutures while the pneumoperitoneum was being created, a #10 scope was placed confirming the intraperitoneal positioning.,Under direct visualization, a suprapubic 5 mm cannula and manipulative probe were placed.  Clockwise inspection of the pelvis revealed a benign vesicouterine pouch, normal uterus and fundus, normal right tube and ovary.  In the cul-de-sac, there were 3 clusters of 3 to 5 carbon charred type endometrial implants and those more distally in the greatest depth had created puckering and tenting.  The left tube and ovary were normal.  There were no adhesions.  There was no evidence of acute pelvic inflammatory disease.,The Endoshears and subsequently cautery on a hook were placed and the implants fulgurated.  Pictures were taken for confirmation both before and after the burn.,The carbon chars were irrigated and aspirated.  The smoke plume was removed without difficulty.  Approximately 50 mL of irrigant was left in the pelvis.  Due to the difficulty in placing and maintaining the Hasson cannula, no attempts were made to view the upper abdominal quadrant, specifically the liver and gallbladder.,The suprapubic cannula was removed under direct visualization, the pneumo released, the scope removed, the stay sutures cut, and the Hasson cannula removed.  The residual sutures were then tied together to completely occlude the fascial opening so that there will be no future hernia at this site.  Finally, the skin incisions were approximated with 3-0 Dexon subcuticularly.  They had been preincisionally injected with bupivacaine to which the patient said she had no known allergies.  The vaginal instruments were removed.  All counts were correct.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and was taken to the recovery room in stable condition.\",\n",

No central embolism.  The proximal subsegmental pulmonary arteries are free of embolus, but the distal subsegmental and segmental arteries especially on the right are limited by extensive pulmonary parenchymal, findings would be discussed in more detail below.  There is no evidence of a central embolism.,As seen on the prior examination, there is a very large heterogeneous right chest wall mass, which measures at least 10 x 12 cm based on axial image #35.  Just superior to the mass is a second heterogeneous focus of neoplasm measuring about 5 x 3.3 cm.  Given the short interval time course from the prior exam, dated 01/23/09, this finding has not significantly changed.  However, there is considerable change in the appearance of the lung fields.  There are now bilateral pleural effusions, small on the right and moderate on the left with associated atelectasis.  There are also extensive right lung consolidations, all new or increased significantly from the prior examination.  Again identified is a somewhat spiculated region of increased density at the right lung apex, which may indicate fibrosis or scarring, but the possibility of primary or metastatic disease cannot be excluded.  There is no pneumothorax in the interval.,On the mediastinal windows, there is presumed subcarinal adenopathy, with one lymph node measuring roughly 12 mm suggestive of metastatic disease here.  There is aortic root and arch and descending thoracic aortic calcification.  There are scattered regions of soft plaque intermixed with this.  The heart is not enlarged.  The left axilla is intact in regards to adenopathy.  The inferior thyroid appears unremarkable.,Limited assessment of the upper abdomen discloses a region of lower density within the right hepatic lobe, this finding is indeterminate, and if there is need for additional imaging in regards to hepatic metastatic disease, follow up ultrasound.  Spleen, adrenal glands, and upper kidneys appear unremarkable.  Visualized portions of the pancreas are unremarkable.,There is extensive rib destruction in the region of the chest wall mass.

His MRI confirmed significant neurologic compression in the cervical spine, combined with a clinical exam consistent with radiculopathy, myelopathy, and weakness.  We discussed the diagnosis and the treatment options.  Due to the severity of his neurologic symptoms as well as the amount of neurologic compression seen radiographically, I recommended that he proceed with surgical intervention as opposed to standard nonsurgical treatment such as physical therapy, medications, and steroid injections.  I explained the surgery itself which will be to remove pressure from the spinal cord via anterior cervical discectomy and fusion at C3-C4 and C4-C5.  We reviewed the surgery itself as well as risks including infection and blood vessels or nerves, leakage of spinal fluid, weakness or paralysis, failure of the pain to improve, possible worsening of the pain, failure of the neurologic symptoms to improve, possible worsening of the neurologic symptoms, and possible need for further surgery including re-revision and/or removal.  Furthermore I explained that the fusion may not become solid or that the hardware could break.  We discussed various techniques available for obtaining fusion and I recommended allograft and plate fixation.  I explained the rationale for this as well as the options of using his own bone.  Furthermore, I explained that removing motion at the fusion sites will transfer stress to other disc levels possibly accelerating there degeneration and causing additional symptoms and/or necessitating additional surgery in the future.,OPERATIVE TECHNIQUE: , After obtaining the appropriate signed and informed consent, the patient was taken to the operating room, where he underwent general endotracheal anesthesia without complications.  He was then positioned supine on the operating table, and all bony prominences were padded.  Pulse oximetry was maintained on both feet throughout the case.  The arms were carefully padded and tucked at his sides.  A roll was placed between the shoulder blades.  The areas of the both ears were sterilely prepped and cranial tongs were applied in routine fashion.  Ten pounds of traction was applied.  A needle was taped to the anterior neck and an x-ray was done to determine the appropriate level for the skin incision.  The entire neck was then sterilely prepped and draped in the usual fashion.,A transverse skin incision was made and carried down to the platysma muscle.  This was then split in line with its fibers.  Blunt dissection was carried down medial to the carotid sheath and lateral to the trachea and esophagus until the anterior cervical spine was visualized.  A needle was placed into a disc and an x-ray was done to determine its location.  The longus colli muscles were then elevated bilaterally with the electrocautery unit.  Self-retaining retractors were placed deep to the longus colli muscle in an effort to avoid injury to the sympathetic chains.,Radical anterior discectomies were performed at C3-C4 and C4-C5.  This included complete removal of the anterior annulus, nucleus, and posterior annulus.  The posterior longitudinal ligament was removed as were the posterior osteophytes.  Foraminotomies were then accomplished bilaterally.  Once all of this was accomplished, the blunt-tip probe was used to check for any residual compression.  The central canal was wide open at each level as were the foramen.,A high-speed bur was used to remove the cartilaginous endplates above and below each interspace.  Bleeding cancellous bone was exposed.  The disc spaces were measured and appropriate size allografts were placed sterilely onto the field.  After further shaping of the grafts with the high-speed bur, they were carefully impacted in to position.  There was good juxtaposition against the bleeding decorticated surfaces and good distraction of each interspace.  All weight was then removed from the crania tongs.,The appropriate size anterior cervical locking plate was chosen and bent into gentle lordosis.  Two screws were then placed into each of the vertebral bodies at C3, C4, and C5.  There was excellent purchase.  A final x-ray was done confirming good position of the hardware and grafts.  The locking screws were then applied, also with excellent purchase.,Following a final copious irrigation, there was good hemostasis and no dural leaks.  The carotid pulse was strong.  A drain was placed deep to the level of the platysma muscle and left at the level of the hardware.  The wounds were then closed in layers using 4-0 Vicryl suture for the platysma muscle, 4-0 Vicryl suture for the subcutaneous tissue, and 4-0 Vicryl suture in a subcuticular skin closure.  Steri-Strips were placed followed by application of a sterile dressing.  The drain was hooked to bulb suction.  A Philadelphia collar was applied.,The cranial tongs were carefully removed.  The soft tissue overlying the puncture site was massaged to free it up from the underlying bone.  There was good hemostasis.,The patient was then carefully returned to the supine position on his hospital bed where he was reversed and extubated and taken to the recovery room having tolerated the procedure well.',\n",

A general anesthesia was induced by the Department of Anesthesia.,The patient was prepped and draped in the normal sterile fashion for a scrotal approach.  A #15 blade was used to make a transverse incision on the left hemiscrotum.  Electrocautery was used to carry the incision down into the tunica vaginalis and the testicle was delivered into the field.  The left testicle was examined.  A large spermatocele was noted.  Metzenbaum scissors were used to dissect the tissue around the left spermatocele.  Once the spermatocele was identified, as stated above, significant size was noted encompassing the entire left epididymis.  Metzenbaum scissors as well as electrocautery was used to dissect free the spermatocele from its testicular attachments and spermatocelectomy and left epididymectomy was completed with electrocautery.  Electrocautery was used to confirm excellent hemostasis.  Attention was then turned to the more proximal aspect of the cord.  The vas deferens was palpated and dissected free with Metzenbaum scissors.  Hemostats were placed on the two aspects of the cord, approximately 1 cm segment of cord was removed with Metzenbaum scissors and electrocautery was used to cauterize the lumen of the both ends of vas deferens and silk ties used to ligate the cut ends.  Testicle was placed back in the scrotum in appropriate anatomic position.  The dartos tissue was closed with running #3-0 Vicryl and the skin was closed in a horizontal interrupted mattress fashion with #4-0 chromic.  Attention was then turned to the right side.  The vas was palpated in the scrotum.  A small skin incision was made with a #15 blade and the vas was grasped with a small Allis clamp and brought into the surgical field.  A scalpel was used to excise the vas sheath and vas was freed from its attachments and grasped again with a hemostat.  Two ends were hemostated with hemostats and divided with Metzenbaum scissors.  Lumen was coagulated with electrocautery.  Silk ties used to ligate both cut ends of the vas deferens and placed back into the scrotum.  A #4-0 chromic suture was used in simple fashion to reapproximate the skin incision.  Scrotum was cleaned and bacitracin ointment, sterile dressing, fluffs, and supportive briefs applied.

       " 'REASON FOR VISIT:  ,The patient is a 38-year-old woman with pseudotumor cerebri without papilledema who comes in because of new onset of headaches.  She comes to clinic by herself.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , Dr. X has cared for her since 2002.  She has a Codman-Hakim shunt set at 90 mmH2O.  She last saw us in clinic in January 2008 and at that time we recommended that she followup with Dr. Y for medical management of her chronic headaches.  We also recommended that the patient see a psychiatrist regarding her depression, which she stated that she would followup with that herself.  Today, the patient returns to clinic because of acute onset of headaches that she has had since her shunt was adjusted after an MRI on 04/18/08.  She states that since that time her headaches have been bad.  They woke her up at night.  She has not been able to sleep.  She has not had a good sleep cycle since that time.  She states that the pain is constant and is worse with coughing, straining, and sneezing as well as on standing up.  She states that they feel a little bit better when lying down.  Medication shave not helped her.  She has tried taking Imitrex as well as Motrin 800 mg twice a day, but she states it has not provided much relief.  The pain is generalized, but also noted to be quite intense in the frontal region of her head.  She also reports ringing in the ears and states that she just does not feel well.  She reports no nausea at this time.  She also states that she has been experiencing intermittent blurry vision and dimming lights as well.  She tells me that she has an appointment with Dr. Y tomorrow.  She reports no other complaints at this time.,MAJOR FINDINGS:,  On examination today, this is a pleasant 38-year-old woman who comes back from the clinic waiting area without difficulty.  She is well developed, well nourished, and kempt.,Vital Signs:  Blood pressure 153/86, pulse 63, and respiratory rate 16.,Cranial Nerves:  Intact for extraocular movements.  Facial movement, hearing, head turning, tongue, and palate movements are all intact.  I did not know any papilledema on exam bilaterally.,I examined her shut site, which is clean, dry, and intact.  She did have a small 3 mm to 4 mm round scab, which was noted farther down from her shunt reservoir.  It looks like there is a little bit of dry blood there.,ASSESSMENT:,  The patient appears to have had worsening headaches since shunt adjustment back after an MRI.,PROBLEMS/DIAGNOSES:,1.  Pseudotumor cerebri without papilledema.,2.  Migraine headaches.,PROCEDURES:,  I programmed her shunt to 90 mmH2O.,PLAN:,  It was noted that the patient began to have an acute onset of headache pain after her shunt adjustment approximately a week and a half ago.  I had programmed her shunt back to 90 mmH2O at that time and confirmed it with an x-ray.  However, the picture of the x-ray was not the most desirable picture.  Thus, I decided to reprogram the shunt back to 90 mmH2O today and have the patient return to Sinai for a skull x-ray to confirm the setting at 90.  In addition, she told me that she is scheduled to see Dr. Y tomorrow, so she should followup with him and also plan on contacting the Wilmer Eye Institute to setup an appointment.  She should followup with the Wilmer Eye Institute as she is complaining of blurry vision and dimming of the lights occasionally.,Total visit time was approximately 60 minutes and about 10 minutes of that time was spent in counseling the patient.',\n",

There was some softening and loss of the articular cartilage over the glenoid.  The labrum was ________ attached permanently to the glenoid.  The biceps tendon was nonsubluxable.  Upon ranging of the shoulder in internal and external rotation showed no evidence of rotator cuff tear on the articular side.  Subacromial space did show excessive soft tissue causing some overstuffing of the subacromial space.  There was reconstitution of the bursa noted as well.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:,  This is a 51-year-old female had left shoulder pain of chronic nature who has had undergone prior rotator cuff debridement in May with partial pain relief and has had continued pain in the left shoulder.  MRI shows partial rotator cuff tear.,PROCEDURE: , The patient was taken to the operating room and placed in a beachchair position.  After all bony prominences were adequately padded, the head was placed in the headholder with no excessive extension in the neck on flexion.  The left extremity was prepped and draped in usual fashion.  The #18 gauge needles were inserted into the left shoulder to locate the AC joint, the lateral aspect of the acromion as well as the pass of the first trocar to enter the shoulder joint from the posterior aspect.  We took an #11 blade scalpel and made a small 1-cm skin incision posteriorly approximately 4-cm inferior and medial to the lateral port of the acromion.  A blunt trocar was used to bluntly cannulate the joint and we put the camera into the shoulder at that point of the joint and instilled sterile saline to distend the capsule and begin our arthroscopic assessment of the shoulder.  A second port was established superior to the biceps tendon anteriorly under direct arthroscopic visualization using #11 blade on the skin and inserted bluntly the trocar and the cannula.  The operative findings found intra-articularly were as described previously gross operative findings.  We did not see any evidence of acute pathology.  We then removed all the arthroscopic instruments as well as the trocars and tunneled subcutaneously into the subacromial space and reestablished the portal and camera and inflow with saline.  The subacromial space was examined and found to have excessive soft tissue and bursa that was in the subacromial space that we debrided using arthroscopic shaver after establishing a lateral portal.  All this was done and hemostasis was achieved.  The rotator cuff was examined from the bursal side and showed no evidence of tears.  There was some fraying out laterally near its attachment over the greater tuberosity, which was debrided with the arthroscopic shaver.  We removed all of our instruments and suctioned the subacromial space dry.  A #4-0 nylon was used on the three arthroscopic portal and on the skin we placed sterile dressing and the arm was placed in an arm sling.  She was placed back on the gurney, extubated and taken to the PACU in stable condition.',\n",

There are no adnexal masses appreciated.  On laparoscopic exam, the uterus, bilateral tubes and ovaries appeared normal.  The liver margin and bowel appeared normal.,PROCEDURE: , After consent was obtained, the patient was taken to the operating room where general anesthetic was administered.  The patient was placed in dorsal lithotomy position and prepped and draped in the normal sterile fashion.  A sterile speculum was placed in the patient's vagina and the anterior lip of the cervix was grasped with a vulsellum tenaculum.  The uterus was then sounded to 7 cm.,The cervix was serially dilated with Hank dilators.  A #20 Hank dilator was left in place.  The sterile speculum was then removed.  Gloves were changed.  Attention was then turned to the abdomen where approximately a 10 mm transverse infraumbilical incision was made through the patient's previous scar.  The Veress needle was placed and gas was turned on.  When good flow and low abdominal pressures were noted, the gas was turned up and the abdomen was allowed to insufflate.  A 11 mm trocar was then placed through this incision and the camera was placed with the above findings noted.  Two 5 mm step trocars were placed, one 2 cm superior to the pubic bone along the midline and the other approximately 7 cm to 8 cm to the left at the level of the umbilicus.  The Endoloop was placed through the left-sided port.  A grasper was placed in the suprapubic port and put through the Endoloop and then a portion of the left tube was identified and grasped with a grasper.  A knuckle of tube was brought up with the grasper and a #0 Vicryl Endoloop synched down across this knuckle of tube.  The suture was then cut using the endoscopic shears.  The portion of tube that was tied off was removed using a Harmonic scalpel.  This was then removed from the abdomen and sent to Pathology.  The right tube was then identified and in a similar fashion, the grasper was placed through the loop of the #0 Vicryl Endoloop and the right tube was grasped with the grasper and the knuckle of tube was brought up into the loop.  The loop was then synched down.  The Endoshears were used to cut the suture.  The Harmonic scalpel was then used to remove that portion of tube.  The portion of the tube that was removed from the abdomen was sent to Pathology.  Both tubes were examined and found to have excellent hemostasis.  All instruments were then removed.  The 5 mm ports were removed with good hemostasis noted.  The camera was removed and the abdomen was allowed to desufflate.  The 11 mm trocar introducer was replaced and the trocar was removed.  The fascia of the infraumbilical incision was reapproximated with an interrupted suture of #3-0 Vicryl.  The skin was then closed with #4-0 undyed Vicryl in a subcuticular fashion.  Approximately 10 cc of Marcaine was injected at the incision site.  The vulsellum tenaculum and cervical dilator were then removed from the patient's cervix with excellent hemostasis noted.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  Sponge, lap, and needle counts were correct at the end of the procedure.  The patient was taken to the recovery room in satisfactory condition.

An orogastric was placed and a Foley catheter placed.  He was placed in a modified flank position with the hips rotated to 45 degrees.  Pillow was used to prevent any pressure points.  He was widely shaved, prepped, and draped.  A marking pen was used to delineate a site for the Pneumo sleeve in the right lower quadrant and for the trocar sites in the midline just above the umbilicus and halfway between the xiphoid and the umbilicus.  The incision was made through the premarked site through the skin and subcutaneous tissue.  The aponeurosis of the external oblique was incised in the direction of its fibers.  Muscle-splitting incision was made in the internal oblique and transversus abdominis.  The peritoneum was opened and the Pneumo sleeve was placed in the usual fashion being sure that no bowel was trapped inside the ring.  Then, abdominal insufflation was carried out through the Pneumo sleeve and the scope was passed through the Pneumo sleeve to visualize placement of the trocars in the other two positions.  Once this had been completed, the scope was placed in the usual port and dissection begun by taking down the white line of Toldt, so that the colon could be retracted medially.  This exposed the duodenum, which was gently swept off the inferior vena cava and dissection easily disclosed the takeoff of the right renal vein off the cava.  Next, attention was directed inferiorly and the ureter was divided between clips and the inferior tongue of Gerota fascia was taken down, so that the psoas muscle was exposed.  The attachments lateral to the kidney was taken down, so that the kidney could be flipped anteriorly and medially, and this helped in exposing the renal artery.  The renal artery had been previously noticed on the CT scan to branch early and so each branch was separately ligated and divided using the stapler device.  After the arteries had been divided, the renal vein was divided again using a stapling device.  The remaining attachments superior to the kidney were divided with the Harmonic scalpel and also utilized the stapler, and the specimen was removed.  Reexamination of the renal fossa at low pressures showed a minimal degree of oozing from the adrenal gland, which was controlled with Surgicel.  Next, the port sites were closed with 0 Vicryl utilizing the passer and doing it over the hand to prevent injury to the bowel and the right lower quadrant incision for the hand port was closed in the usual fashion.  The estimated blood loss was negligible.  There were no complications.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and left the operating room in satisfactory condition.',\n",

Originally, he was raised by both parents, but they separated at an early age.  When he was about seven years old, he was raised by his mother and stepfather.  He did not sustain a relationship with his biological father from that time on.  He stated his parents moved a lot, and because this many times he was picked on in his new environments, Mr. T stated he was, at times, a rebellious teenager, but he denied any significant inability to socialize, and denied any learning disabilities or the need for special education.,Mr. T stated his stepfather was somewhat verbally abusive, and that he committed suicide when Mr. T was 18 years old.  He graduated from high school and began work at Dana Corporation for two to three years, after which he worked as an energy, auditor for a gas company.

At times he showed some involuntary movements that would be more akin to a resting tremor.  There was no psychomotor retardation, but there was some mild psychomotor excitement.  His speech was clear, concise, but pressured.  His attitude was overly negative and his mood was significant for moderate depression, anxiety, anhedonia and loneliness, and mild evidence of anger.

There was no evidence of incoherence, irrelevance, evasiveness, circumstantiality, loose associations, or concrete thinking.  There was no evidence of delusions; however, there was some ambivalence, guilt, and self-derogatory thoughts.  There was evidence of concreteness for similarities and proverbs.

There was no evidence for indices of malingering as there was no marked discrepancy between claimed impairment and objective findings, and there was no lack of cooperation with the evaluation or poor compliance with treatment, and no evidence of antisocial personality disorder.,IMPRESSIONS: , Major Depressive Disorder, single episode,RECOMMENDATIONS AND PLAN: , I recommend Mr. T continue with psychopharmacologic care as well as psychotherapy.  At this time, the excessive amount of psychiatric symptoms would impede Mr. T from seeking employment.  Furthermore, it appears that the primary precipitating event had occurred on March 25, 2003, when Mr. T was fired from his job after being harassed for over a year.  As Mr. T placed his entire identity and sense of survival on his work, this was a deafening blow to his psychological functioning.

The patient's parents relayed that they first noted a relatively small but noticeable mass in the middle portion of her thyroid gland about 2004.  An ultrasound examination had reportedly been done in the past and the mass is being observed.  When it began to enlarge recently, she was referred to the Pediatric Endocrinology Department and had an evaluation there.  The patient was referred for fine needle aspiration and the reports recently returned a diagnosis of papillary thyroid carcinoma.  The patient has not had any hoarseness, difficulty swallowing, or any symptoms of endocrine dysfunction.  She has no weight changes consistent with either hyper or hypothyroidism.  There is no family history of thyroid cancer in her family.  She has no notable discomfort with this lesion.  There have been no skin changes.  Historically, she does not have a history of any prior head and neck radiation or treatment of any unusual endocrinopathy.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:,  Essentially unremarkable.  The patient has never been hospitalized in the past for any major illnesses.  She has had no prior surgical procedures.,IMMUNIZATIONS: , Current and up to date.,ALLERGIES: , She has no known drug allergies.,CURRENT MEDICATIONS:  ,Currently taking no routine medications.  She describes her pain level currently as zero.,FAMILY HISTORY: , There is no significant family history, although the patient's father does note that his mother had a thyroid surgery at some point in life, but it was not known whether this was for cancer, but he suspects it might have been for goiter.  This was done in Tijuana.  His mom is from central portion of Mexico.  There is no family history of multiple endocrine neoplasia syndromes.,SOCIAL HISTORY:  ,The patient is a junior at Hoover High School.  She lives with her mom in Fresno.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: , A careful 12-system review was completely normal except for the problems related to the thyroid mass.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,GENERAL:  The patient is a 55.7 kg, nondysmorphic, quiet, and perhaps slightly apprehensive young lady, who was in no acute distress.  She was alert and oriented x3 and had an appropriate affect.,HEENT:  The head and neck examination is most significant.  There is mild amount of facial acne.  The patient's head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat appeared to be grossly normal.,NECK:  There is a slightly visible midline bulge in the region of the thyroid isthmus.  A firm nodule is present there, and there is also some nodularity in the right lobe of the thyroid.  This mass is relatively hard, slightly fixed, but not tethered to surrounding tissues, skin, or muscles that I can determine.  There are some shotty adenopathy in the area.  No supraclavicular nodes were noted.,CHEST:  Excursions are symmetric with good air entry.,LUNGS:  Clear.,CARDIOVASCULAR:  Normal.  There is no tachycardia or murmur noted.,ABDOMEN:  Benign.,EXTREMITIES:  Extremities are anatomically correct with full range of motion.,GENITOURINARY:  External genitourinary exam was deferred at this time and can be performed later during anesthesia.  This is same as too for her rectal examination.,SKIN:  There is no acute rash, purpura, or petechiae.,NEUROLOGIC:  Normal and no focal deficits.  Her voice is strong and clear.  There is no evidence of dysphonia or vocal cord malfunction.,DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES: , I reviewed laboratory data from the Diagnostics Lab, which included a mild abnormality in the AST at 11, which is slightly lower than the normal range.  T4 and TSH levels were recorded as normal.  Free thyroxine was normal, and the serum pregnancy test was negative.  There was no level of thyroglobulin recorded on this.  A urinalysis and comprehensive metabolic panel was unremarkable.  A chest x-ray was obtained, which I personally reviewed.  There is a diffuse pattern of tiny nodules in both lungs typical of miliary metastatic disease that is often seen in patients with metastatic thyroid carcinoma.,IMPRESSION/PLAN: , The patient is a 16-year-old young lady with a history of thyroid mass that is now biopsy proven as papillary.  The pattern of miliary metastatic lesions in the chest is consistent with this diagnosis and is unfortunate in that it generally means a more advanced stage of disease.  I spent approximately 30 minutes with the patient and her family today discussing the surgical aspects of the treatment of this disease.  During this time, we talked about performing a total thyroidectomy to eradicate as much of the native thyroid tissue and remove the primary source of the cancer in anticipation of radioactive iodine therapy.  We talked about sentinel node dissection, and we spent significant amount of time talking about the possibility of hypoparathyroidism if all four of the parathyroid glands were damaged during this operation.  We also discussed the recurrent laryngeal and external laryngeal branches of the nerve supplying the vocal cord function and how they cane be damaged during the thyroidectomy as well.  I answered as many of the family's questions as they could mount during this stressful time with this recent information supplied to them.  I also did talk to them about the chest x-ray pattern, which was complete __________ as the film was just on the day prior to my clinic visit.  This will have some impact on the postoperative adjunctive therapy.  The radiologist commented about the risk of pulmonary fibrosis and the use of radioactive iodine in this situation, but it seems likely that is going to be necessary to attempt to treat this disease in the patient's case.  I did discuss with them the possibility of having to take large doses of calcium and vitamin D in the event of hypoparathyroidism if that does happen, and we also talked about possibly sparing parathyroid tissue and reimplanting it in a muscle belly either in the neck or forearm if that becomes a necessity.  All of the family's questions have been answered.  This is a very anxious and anxiety provoking time in the family.  I have made every effort to get the patient under schedule within the next 48 hours to have this operation done.  We are tentatively planning on proceeding this upcoming Friday afternoon with total thyroidectomy.\",\n",

The tube used was Santa Barbara.,ANESTHESIA:,  General.,INDICATION: , This is a 98-year-old female whom I have known for several years.  She has a marginal hearing.  With the additional conductive loss secondary to the retraction of the tympanic membrane, her hearing aid and function deteriorated significantly.  So, we have kept sets of tubes in her ears at all times.  The major problem is that she has got small ear canals and a very sensitive external auditory canal; therefore it cannot tolerate even the wax cleaning in the clinic awake.,The patient was seen in the OR and tubes were placed.  There were no significant findings.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , After obtaining informed consent from the patient, she was brought to the neurosensory OR, placed under general anesthesia.  Mask airway was used.  IV had already been started.,On the right side, we removed the old tube and then cleaned the cerumen and found that it was larger than the side of the tube in perfection or perforation in tympanic membrane in the anterior inferior quadrant.  In the same area, a small Santa Barbara tube was placed.  This T-tube was cut to 80% of its original length for comfort and then positioned to point straight out and treated.  Three drops of ciprofloxacin eyedrops was placed in the ear canal.,On the left side, the tympanic membrane adhered and it was retracted and has some myringosclerosis.  Anterior, inferior incision was made.  Tympanic membrane bounced back to neutral position.  A Santa Barbara tube was cut to the 80% of the original length and placed in the hole.  Ciprofloxacin drops were placed in the ear.  Procedure completed.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: , None.,COMPLICATION: , None.,SPECIMEN:,  None.,DISPOSITION:,  To PACU in a stable condition.',\n",

Anterior cervical discectomy of C3-C4.,2.  Removal of herniated disc and osteophytes.,3.  Bilateral C4 nerve root decompression.,4.  Harvesting of bone for autologous vertebral bodies for creation of arthrodesis.,5.  Grafting of fibular allograft bone for creation of arthrodesis.,6.  Creation of arthrodesis via an anterior technique with fibular allograft bone and autologous bone from the vertebral bodies.,7.  Placement of anterior spinal instrumentation using the operating microscope and microdissection technique.,INDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURE: , This 62-year-old man has progressive and intractable right C4 radiculopathy with neck and shoulder pain.  Conservative therapy has failed to improve the problem.  Imaging studies showed severe spondylosis of C3-C4 with neuroforaminal narrowing and spinal cord compression.,A detailed discussion ensued with the patient as to the nature of the procedure including all risks and alternatives.  He clearly understood it and had no further questions and requested that I proceed.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , The patient was placed on the operating room table and was intubated using a fiberoptic technique.  The methylprednisolone spinal cord protocol was instituted with bolus and continuous infusion doses.  The neck was carefully prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.,A transverse incision was made on a skin crease on the left side of the neck.  Dissection was carried down through the platysmal musculature and the anterior spine was exposed.  The medial borders of the longus colli muscles were dissected free from their attachments to the spine.  A needle was placed and it was believed to be at the C3-C4 interspace and an x-ray properly localized this space.  Castoff self-retaining pins were placed into the body of the C3 and C4.  Self-retaining retractors were placed in the wound keeping the blades of the retractors underneath the longus colli muscles.,The annulus was incised and a discectomy was performed.  Quite a bit of overhanging osteophytes were identified and removed.  As I worked back to the posterior lips of the vertebral body, the operating microscope was utilized.,There was severe overgrowth of spondylitic spurs.  A high-speed diamond bur was used to slowly drill these spurs away.  I reached the posterior longitudinal ligament and opened it and exposed the underlying dura.,Slowly and carefully I worked out towards the C3-C4 foramen.  The dura was extremely thin and I could see through it in several areas.  I removed the bony compression in the foramen and identified soft tissue and veins overlying the root.  All of these were not stripped away for fear of tearing this very tissue-paper-thin dura.  However, radical decompression was achieved removing all the bony compression in the foramen, out to the pedicle, and into the foramen.  An 8-mm of the root was exposed although I left the veins over the root intact.,The microscope was angled to the left side where a similar procedure was performed.,Once the decompression was achieved, a high-speed cortisone bur was used to decorticate the body from the greater posterior shelf to prevent backward graft migration.  Bone thus from the drilling was preserved for use for the arthrodesis.,Attention was turned to creation of the arthrodesis.  As I had drilled quite a bit into the bodies, I selected a large 12-mm graft and distracted the space maximally.  Under distraction the graft was placed and fit well.  An x-ray showed good graft placement.,Attention was turned to spinal instrumentation.  A Synthes Short Stature plate was used with four 3-mm screws.  Holes were drilled with all four screws were placed with pretty good purchase.  Next, the locking screws were then applied.  An x-ray was obtained which showed good placement of graft, plate, and screws.  The upper screws were near the upper endplate of C3.  The C3 vertebral body that remained was narrow after drilling off the spurs.  Rather than replace these screws and risk that the next holes would be too near the present holes I decided to leave these screws intact because their position is still satisfactory as they are below the disc endplate.,Attention was turned to closure.  A Hemovac drain was placed in the anterior vertebral body space and brought out through a separate stab wound incision in the skin.  The wound was then carefully closed in layers.  Sterile dressings were applied along with a rigid Philadelphia collar.  The operation was then terminated.,The patient tolerated the procedure well and left for the recovery room in excellent condition.  The sponge and needle counts were reported as correct and there were no intraoperative complications.,Specimens were sent to Pathology consisted of bone and soft tissue as well as C3-C4 disc material.',\n",

The patient has previously met with the electrophysiologist, Dr. X, at General Hospital and it sounds like he had a negative EP study.,SOCIAL HISTORY: , The patient does not smoke cigarettes, abuse alcohol nor drink any caffeine.  No use of illicit drugs.  He has been married for 22 years and he is actually accompanied throughout today\\'s cardiology consultation by his wife.  He is not participating in regular exercises now because he states since starting flecainide, he has gotten sluggish.  He is employed as an attorney and while he states that overall his mental stress is better, he has noted more recent mental stress this past weekend when he was taking his daughter back to college.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: , He denies any history of stroke, cancer, vomiting of blood, coughing up blood, bright red blood per rectum, bleeding stomach ulcers, renal calculi.  There are some questions especially as his wife has told me that he may have obstructive sleep apnea and not had a formal sleep study.,PHYSICAL EXAM: , Blood pressure 156/93, pulse is 100, respiratory rate 18.

I have reviewed again with him in detail regarding risks, benefits, and alternatives of proceeding with cardioversion, which the patient is in favor of.  After in depth explanation of the procedure with him that there would be more definitive resumption of normal sinus rhythm by using electrocardioversion with less long-term side effects, past the acute procedure, alternatives being continued atrial flutter with potential for electrophysiologic consultation for ablation and/or heart rate control with anticoagulation, which the patient was not interested nor was I primarily recommending as the next step, and risks including, but not limited to and the patient was aware and this was all done in the presence of his wife that this is not an all-inclusive list, but the risks include but not limited to oversedation from conscious sedation, risk of aspiration pneumonia from regurgitation of stomach contents, which would be less likely as I did confirm with the patient that he had been n.p.o. for greater than 15 hours, risk of induction of other arrhythmias including tachyarrhythmias requiring further management including cardioversion or risk of bradyarrhythmias, in the past when we had a cardioverter with 150 joules, he did have a 5.5-second pause especially while he is on antiarrhythmic therapy, statistically less significant risk of CVA, although we cannot really make that null.  The patient expressed understanding of this risk, benefit, and alternative analysis.  I invited questions from him and his wife and once their questions were answered to their self-stated satisfaction, we planned to go forward with the procedure.,PROCEDURE NOTE:  ,The patient received a total of 7 mg of Versed and 50 micrograms of fentanyl utilizing titrate-down sedation with good effect and this was after the appropriate time-out procedure had been done as per the Medical Center universal protocol with appropriate identification of the patient, position, procedure documentation, procedure indication, and there were no questions.  The patient did actively participate in this time-out procedure.  After the universal protocol was done, he then received the cardioversion attempt with 50 joules using \"lollipop posterior patch\" with hands-driven paddle on the side, which was 50 joules of synchronized biphasic energy.  There was successful resumption of normal sinus rhythm, in fact this time there was not a significant pause as compared to when he had this done previously in late 12/09 and this sinus rhythm was confirmed by a 12-lead EKG.,IMPRESSION: , Cardioversion shows successful resumption of normal sinus rhythm from atrial flutter and that is while the patient has been maintained on Coumadin and his INR is 3.22.  We are going to watch him and discharge him from the Medical Center area on his current flecainide of 200 mg in the morning and 100 mg in the evening, atenolol 25 mg once a day, Coumadin _____ as currently being diagnosed.  I had previously discussed with the patient and he was agreeable with meeting with his electrophysiologist again, Dr. X, at Electrophysiology Unit at General Hospital and I will be planning to place a call for Dr. X myself.  Again, he has no ischemia on this most recent stress test and I suppose in the future it may be reasonable to get obstructive sleep apnea evaluation and that may be one issue promulgating his symptoms.,I had previously discussed the case with Dr. Y who is the patient\\'s general cardiologist as well as updated his wife at the patient\\'s bedside regarding our findings.',\n",

The patient was placed in the supine position under spinal anesthesia with a Foley catheter in place and she was prepped and draped in the usual manner.  A low abdominal transverse skin incision was constructed and carried down through the subcutaneous tissue through the anterior rectus fascia.  Bleeding points were snapped and coagulated along the way.  The fascia was opened transversally and was dissected sharply and bluntly from the underlying rectus muscles.  These were divided in the midline revealing the peritoneum, which was opened vertically.  The uterus was in mid position.  The bladder flap was incised elliptically and reflected caudad.  A low transverse hysterotomy incision was then constructed and extended bluntly.  Amniotomy revealed clear amniotic fluid.  A live born vigorous male infant was then delivered from the right occiput transverse position.  The infant breathed and cried spontaneously.  The nares and pharynx were suctioned.  The umbilical cord was clamped and divided and the infant was passed to the waiting neonatal team.  Cord blood samples were obtained.  The placenta was manually removed and the uterus was eventrated for closure.  The edges of the uterine incision were grasped with Pennington clamps and closure was carried out in standard two-layer technique using 0 Vicryl suture with the second layer imbricating the first.  Hemostasis was completed with an additional figure-of-eight suture of 0 Vicryl.  The cornual sac and gutters were irrigated.  The uterus was returned to the abdominal cavity.  The adnexa were inspected and were normal.  The abdomen was then closed in layers.  Fascia was closed with running 0 Vicryl sutures, subcutaneous tissue with running 3-0 plain Catgut, and skin with 3-0 Monocryl subcuticular suture and Steri-Strips.

The right anterior chest and supraclavicular fossa area, neck, and left side of chest were prepped with Betadine and draped in a sterile fashion.  Xylocaine 1% was infiltrated in the supraclavicular area and anterior chest along the planned course of the catheter.  The patient was placed into Trendelenburg position.,The right internal jugular vein was accessed by a supraclavicular 19-gauge, thin-walled needle as demonstrated by easy withdrawal of venous blood on the first pass of the needle.  Under fluoroscopic control, a J-wire was advanced into the right atrium.  The needle was removed and the skin puncture site enlarged to about 8 mm with the scalpel.  A second incision was made 5 cm inferior to the right midclavicular line, through which an Ash split catheter was advanced, using the tunneling rod, in a gently curving pass to exit the skin of the neck incision.  The tunneling needle was removed and the catheter split up to the marker as indicated in the recommended use of the catheter.,Sequential dilators were advanced over the J-wire under fluoroscopic control to dilate the subcutaneous tunnel followed by advancement of a dilator and sheath into the right superior vena cava under fluoroscopic control.  The dilator and wire were removed, leaving the sheath in position, through which a double-lumen catheter was advanced into the central venous system.  The sheath was peeled away, leaving the catheter into position.  Each port of the catheter was flushed with dilute heparinized saline.,The patient was returned to the flat position.

Live male infant with Apgars of 9 and 9.,2.  Placenta delivered spontaneously intact with a three-vessel cord.,DISPOSITION:  ,The patient and baby remain in the LDR in stable condition.,SUMMARY: , This is a 36-year-old G1 woman who was pregnant since 40 weeks 6 days when she was admitted for induction of labor for post dates with favorable cervix.  When she was admitted, her cervix was 2.5 cm dilated with 80% effacement.  The baby had a -2 station.  She had no regular contractions.  Fetal heart tones were 120s and reactive.  She was started on Pitocin for labor induction and labored quite rapidly.  She had spontaneous rupture of membranes with a clear fluid.  She had planned on an epidural; however, she had sudden rapid cervical change and was unable to get the epidural.  With the rapid cervical change and descent of fetal head, there were some variable decelerations.  The baby was at a +1 station when the patient began pushing.  I had her push to get the baby to a +2 station.  During pushing, the fetal heart tones were in the 80s and did not recover in between contractions.  Because of this, I recommended a vacuum delivery for the baby.  The patient agreed.,The baby's head was confirmed to be in the right occiput anterior presentation.  The perineum was injected with 1% lidocaine.  The bladder was drained.  The vacuum was placed and the correct placement in front of the posterior fontanelle was confirmed digitally.  With the patient's next contraction, the vacuum was inflated and a gentle downward pressure was used to assist with brining the baby's head to a +3 station.  The contraction ended.  The vacuum was released and the fetal heart tones remained in the, at this time, 90s to 100s.  With the patient's next contraction, the vacuum was reapplied and the baby's head was delivered to a +4 station.  A modified Ritgen maneuver was used to stabilize the fetal head.  The vacuum was deflated and removed.  The baby's head then delivered atraumatically.  There was no nuchal cord.  The baby's anterior shoulder delivered after a less than 30 second delay.  No additional maneuvers were required to deliver the anterior shoulder.  The posterior shoulder and remainder of the body delivered easily.  The baby's mouth and nose were bulb suctioned.  The cord was clamped x2 and cut.  The infant was handed to the respiratory therapist.,Pitocin was added to the patient's IV fluids.  The placenta delivered spontaneously, was intact and had a three-vessel cord.  A vaginal inspection revealed a third-degree midline laceration as well as a right vaginal side wall laceration.  The right side wall laceration was repaired with #3-0 Vicryl suture in a running fashion with local anesthesia.  The third-degree laceration was also repaired with #3-0 Vicryl sutures.  Local anesthesia was used.  The capsule was visible, but did not appear to be injured at all.  It was reinforced with three separate interrupted sutures and then the remainder of the incision was closed with #3-0 Vicryl in the typical fashion.,The patient tolerated the procedure very well.  She remains in the LDR with the baby.  The baby is vigorous, crying and moving all extremities.  He will go to the new born nursery when ready.  The total time for repair of the laceration was 25 minutes.\",\n",

He is currently at home and has left nursing home facility.  He states that his pain is well controlled.  He has been working with physical therapy two to three times a week.  He has had no drainage or fever.  He has noticed some increasing paresthesias in his bilateral feet but has a history of spinal stenosis with lower extremity neuropathy.,FINDINGS: , On physical exam, his incision is near well healed.  He has no effusion noted.  His range of motion is 10 to 105 degrees.  He has no pain or crepitance.  On examination of his right foot, he is nontender to palpation of the metatarsal heads.  He has 4 out of 5 strength in EHL, FHL, tibialis, and gastroc-soleus complex.  He does have decreased sensation to light touch in the L4-L5 distribution of his feet bilaterally.,X-rays taken including AP and lateral of the right knee demonstrate a healed medial tibial plateau fracture status post percutaneous screw fixation.  Examination of three views of the right foot demonstrates the second through fifth metatarsal head fractures.  These appear to be extraarticular.  They are all in a bayonet arrangement, but there appears to be bridging callus between the fragments on the oblique film.,ASSESSMENT:  ,Four months status post percutaneous screw fixation of the right medial tibial plateau and second through fifth metatarsal head fractures.,PLANS: , I would like the patient to continue working with physical therapy.  He may be weightbearing as tolerated on his right side.  I would like him to try to continue to work to gain full extension of the right knee and increase his knee flexion.  I also would like him to work on ambulation and strengthening.,I discussed with the patient his concerning symptoms of paresthesias.  He said he has had the left thigh for a number of years and has been followed by a neurologist for this.  He states that he has had some right-sided paresthesias now for a number of weeks.  He claims he has no other symptoms of any worsening stenosis.  I told him that I would see his neurologist for evaluation or possibly a spinal surgeon if his symptoms progress.,The patient should follow up in 2 months at which time he should have AP and lateral of the right knee and three views of the right foot.',\n",
       " 'PROCEDURE: , Left heart catheterization, coronary angiography, left ventriculography.,COMPLICATIONS: , None.,PROCEDURE DETAIL: , The right femoral area was draped and prepped in the usual fashion after Xylocaine infiltration.  A 6-French arterial sheath was placed in the usual fashion.  Left and right coronary angiograms were then performed in various projections after heparin was given 2000 units intraaortic.  The right coronary artery was difficult to cannulate because of its high anterior takeoff.  This was nondominant.  Several catheters were used.  Ultimately, an AL1 diagnostic catheter was used.  A pigtail catheter was advanced across the aortic valve.  Left ventriculogram was then done in the RAO view using 30 mL of contrast.  Pullback gradient was obtained across the aortic valve.  Femoral angiogram was performed through the sheath which was above the bifurcation, was removed with a Perclose device with good results.  There were no complications.  He tolerated this procedure well and returned to his room in good condition.,FINDINGS,1.  Right coronary artery:  This has an unusual high anterior takeoff.  The vessel is nondominant, has diffuse mild-to-moderate disease.,2.  Left main trunk:  A 30% to 40% distal narrowing is present.,3.  Left anterior descending:  Just at the ostium of the vessel and up to and including the bifurcation of the first large diagonal branch, there is 80 to 90% narrowing.  The diagonal is a large vessel about 3 mm in size.,4.  Circumflex:  Dominant vessel, 50% narrowing at the origin of the obtuse marginal.  After this, there is 40% narrowing in the AV trunk.  The small posterior lateral branch has diffuse mild disease and then the vessel gives rise to a fairly large posterior ventricular branch, which has 70% ostial narrowing, and then after this the posterior descending has 80% narrowing at its origin.,5.  Left ventriculogram:  Normal volume in diastole and systole.  Normal systolic function is present.  There is no mitral insufficiency or left ventricular outflow obstruction.,DIAGNOSES,1.  Severe complex left anterior descending and distal circumflex disease with borderline, probably moderate narrowing of a large obtuse marginal branch.  Dominant circumflex system.  Severe disease of the posterior descending.  Mild left main trunk disease.,2.  Normal left ventricular systolic function.,Given the complex anatomy of the predominant problem which is the left anterior descending; given its ostial stenosis and involvement of the bifurcation of the diagonal, would recommend coronary bypass surgery.  The patient also has severe disease of the circumflex which is dominant.  This anatomy is not appropriate for percutaneous intervention.  The case will be reviewed with a cardiac surgeon.',\n",

She was initially seen by Dr. A back in September 2001 for abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting.  During those times, it was suspected that part of her symptoms may be secondary to biliary disease and underwent a cholecystectomy performed in Oregon by Dr.  A in August 2001.  It was assumed that this was caused by biliary dyskinesia.  Previous to that, an upper endoscopy was performed by Dr. B in July 2001 that showed to be mild gastritis secondary to anti-inflammatory use.

She states that she has been diagnosed with hereditary osteochondromas.  She has had previous dissection of osteochondromas in the past and currently has not been diagnosed in her feet as well as spine and back.  The patient desires surgical treatment at this time.,PROCEDURE:  ,An IV was instituted by the Department of Anesthesia in the preoperative holding area.  The patient was transported to the operating room and placed on operating table in the supine position with a safety belt across her lap.  Copious amounts of Webril were placed on the left ankle followed by a blood pressure cuff.  After adequate sedation by the Department of Anesthesia, a total of 5 cc of 1:1 mixture of 1% lidocaine plain and 0.5% Marcaine plain were injected in the diamond block type fashion around the navicular bone as well as the fifth metatarsal.  Foot was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile orthopedic fashion.,Foot was elevated from the operating table and exsanguinated with an Esmarch bandage.  The pneumatic ankle tourniquet was then inflated to 250 mmHg.  The foot was lowered as well as the operating table.  The sterile stockinet was reflected and the foot was cleansed with wet and dry sponge.  Attention was then directed to the navicular region on the right foot.  The area was palpated until the bony prominence was noted.  A curvilinear incision was made over the area of bony prominence.  At that time, a total of 10 cc with addition of 1% additional lidocaine plain was injected into the surgical site.  The incision was then deepened with #15 blade.  All vessels encountered were ligated for hemostasis.  The dissection was carried down to the level of the capsule and periosteum.  A linear incision was made over the navicular bone obliquely from proximal dorsal to distal plantar over the navicular bone.  The periosteum and the capsule were then reflected from the navicular bone at this time.  A bony prominence was noted both medially and plantarly to the navicular bone.  An osteotome and mallet were then used to resect the enlarged portion of the navicular bone.  After resection with an osteotome there was noted to be a large plantar shelf.  The surrounding soft tissues were then freed from this plantar area.  Care was taken to protect the attachments of the posterior tibial tendon as much as possible.  Only minimal resection of its attachment to the fiber was performed in order to expose the bone.  Sagittal saw was then used to resect the remaining plantar medial prominent bone.  The area was then smoothed with reciprocating rasp until no sharp edges were noted.  The area was flushed with copious amount of sterile saline at which time there was noted to be a palpable ________ where the previous bony prominence had been noted.  The area was then again flushed with copious amounts of sterile saline and the capsule and periosteum were then reapproximated with #3-0 Vicryl.  The subcutaneous tissues were then reapproximated with #4-0 Vicryl to reduce tension from the incision and running #5-0 Vicryl subcuticular stitch was performed.,Attention was then directed to the fifth metatarsal.  There was noted to be a palpable bony prominence dorsally with fifth metatarsal head as well as radiographic evidence laterally of an osteochondroma at the neck of the fifth metatarsal.  Approximately 7 cm incision was made dorsolaterally over the fifth metatarsal.  The incision was then deepened with #15 blade.  Care was taken to preserve the extensor tendon.  The incision was then created over the capsule and periosteum of the fifth metatarsal head.  Capsule and periosteum were reflected both dorsally, laterally, and plantarly.  At that time, there was noted to be a visible osteochondroma on the plantar lateral aspect of the fifth metatarsal neck as well as on the dorsal aspect of the head of the fifth metatarsal.  A sagittal saw was used to resect both of these osteal prominences.,All remaining sharp edges were then smoothed with reciprocating rasp.  The area was inspected for the remaining bony prominences and none was noted.  The area was flushed with copious amounts of sterile saline.  The capsule and periosteum were then reapproximated with #3-0 Vicryl.  Subcutaneous closure was then performed with #4-0 Vicryl in order to reduce tension around the incision line.  Running #5-0 subcutaneous stitch was then performed.  Steri-Strips were applied to both surgical sites.  Dressings consisted of Adaptic, soaked in Betadine, 4x4s, Kling, Kerlix, and Coban.  The pneumatic ankle tourniquet was released and the hyperemic flush was noted to all five digits of the right foot.,The patient tolerated the above procedure and anesthesia well without complications.  The patient was transferred to the PACU with vital signs stable and vascular status intact.  The patient was given postoperative pain prescription and instructed to be partially weightbearing with crutches as tolerated.

       " \"CHIEF COMPLAINT: , Followup of hospital discharge for Guillain-Barre syndrome.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , This is a 62-year-old right-handed woman with hypertension, diabetes mellitus, a silent stroke involving right basal ganglia who was in her usual state of baseline health until late June of 2006 when she had onset of blurred vision, diplopia, and possible weakness in the right greater than left arm and left-sided ptosis.  She was admitted to the hospital.  The MRI showed only an old right basal ganglion infarct.  She subsequently had a lumbar puncture, which showed increased protein, and an EMG/nerve conduction study performed by Dr. X on July 3rd, showed early signs of AIDP.  The patient was treated with intravenous gamma globulin and had some mild improvement in her symptoms.  Her vital capacities were normal during the hospitalization.  Her chest x-ray was negative for any acute process.  She was discharged to rehab from July 12, 2006 to July 20, 2006.  She made some progress in which she notes that her walking is definitely better.  However, she notes that she still has some problems with eye movement and her vision.  This is possibly her main problem.  She also reports tightness and pain in her mid back.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:,  Documented in the clinic note.  The patient has problems with diabetes, double vision, blurry vision, muscle pain, weakness, trouble walking, and headaches about two to three times per week.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:,1.  Hypertension.,2.  Diabetes mellitus.,3.  Stroke involving the right basal ganglion.,4.  Guillain-Barre syndrome diagnosed in June of 2006.,5.  Bilateral knee replacements.,6.

She does not smoke, drink or use any illicit drugs.,MEDICATIONS:,  Percocet 5/325 mg 4-6 hours p.r.n., Neurontin 100 mg per day, insulin, Protonix 40 mg per day, Toprol-XL 50 mg q.d., Norvasc 10 mg q.d., glipizide ,10 mg q.d., fluticasone 50 mcg nasal spray, Lasix 20 mg b.i.d., and Zocor 1 mg q.d.,ALLERGIES: , No known drug allergies.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: , Blood pressure 122/74, heart rate 68, respiratory rate 16, and weight 228 pounds.  Pain scale 5/10.  Please see the written note for details.  General exam is benign other than mild obesity.  On neuro examination, mental status is normal.  Cranial nerves are significant for full visual fields and pupils are equal and reactive.  However, extraocular movements are very limited.  She has some adduction of the left eye and she has minimal upgaze of both eyes, but otherwise the eyes do not move.  Face is symmetric.  Sensation is intact.  Tongue and uvula are in midline.  Palate is elevated symmetrically.  Shoulder shrug is strong.  The patient's muscle exam shows normal bulk and tone throughout.  She has no weakness of the left upper extremity.  In the right upper extremity, she has only about 2/5 strength in the right shoulder, but is otherwise 5/5.  There is no drift or orbit.  Reflexes are absent throughout.  Sensory exam is intact to light touch, pinprick, vibration, and proprioception is normal.  There is no dysmetria.  Gait is somewhat limited possibly by her vision and possibly also by her balance problems.,PERTINENT DATA:,  As reviewed previously.,DISCUSSION: , This is a 62-year-old woman with hypertension, diabetes mellitus, prior stroke who has what sounds like Guillain-Barre syndrome, likely the Miller-Fisher variant.  The patient has shown some improvement with IVIG and continues to show some gradual improvement.  I discussed with the patient the course of disease, which is often weeks to about a month or so of worsening followed by many months of gradual improvement.,I told her that it is possible she may not recover 100%, but that certainly there is still plenty of time for her to have additional recovery over what she has right now.  She is scheduled to see an ophthalmologist.  I think it is reasonable for close followup of her visual symptoms progress.  However, I certainly would not take any corrective measures at this point as I suspect her vision will improve gradually.,I discussed with the patient that with respect to her back pain certainly the Neurontin is relatively at low dose and this could be increased further.  I wanted her to start taking the Neurontin 300 mg per day and then 300 mg b.i.d. after one week.  She will call me in approximately three weeks' time to let me know how she is doing and if needed we will titrate up further.,She was apparently given some baclofen by her internist and I think this is not unreasonable.  I definitely hope to get her off the Percocet in the future.,IMPRESSION:,1.  Guillain-Barre Miller-Fisher variant.,2.  Hypertension.,3.  Diabetes mellitus.,4.  Stroke.,RECOMMENDATIONS:,1.  The patient is to start taking aspirin 162 mg per day.,2.  Followup with ophthalmology.,3.  Increase Neurontin to 300 mg per day x 1 week and then 300 mg b.i.d.,4.  Followup by phone in three to four weeks.,5.  Followup in this clinic in approximately two months' time.,6.  Call for any questions or problems.\",\n",

The patient recently underwent a fistulogram with angioplasty at the proximal upper arm cephalic vein due to a stenosis detected on Duplex ultrasound.  The patient subsequently was noted to have poor flow to the fistula, and the fistula was difficult to palpate.  A repeat ultrasound was performed which demonstrated a high-grade stenosis involving the distal upper arm cephalic vein just distal to the brachial anastomosis.  The patient presents today for a left arm fistulogram with angioplasty.  The risks, benefits, and alternatives of the procedure were discussed with the patient and understands and in agreement to proceed.,PROCEDURE DETAILS:  ,The patient was brought to the angio suite and laid supine on the table.  After sedation was administered, the left arm was then prepped and draped in a standard surgical fashion.  Continuous pulse oximetry and cardiac monitoring were performed throughout the procedure.  The patient was given 1 g of IV Ancef prior to incision.,The left brachiocephalic fistula was visualized with bevel ultrasound.  The cephalic vein in the proximal upper arm region appeared to be of adequate caliber.  There was an area of stenosis at the proximal cephalic vein just distal to the brachial artery anastomosis.  The cephalic vein in the proximal forearm region was easily compressible.  The skin overlying the vessel was injected with 1% lidocaine solution.  A small incision was made with the #11 blade.  The cephalic vein then was cannulated with a 5 French micropuncture introducer sheath.  The sheath was advanced over the wire.  A fistulogram was performed which demonstrated a high-grade stenosis just distal to the brachial artery anastomosis.  The introducer sheath was then exchanged for a 5 French sheath over a 0.025 guide wire.  The sheath was aspirated and flushed with heparinized saline solution.  A 0.025 glidewire was then obtained and advanced, placed over the sheath and across the area of stenosis into the brachial artery.  A 5 French short Kumpe catheter was used to guide the wire into the distal brachial and radial artery.  After crossing the area of stenosis, a 5 x 20 mm standard angioplasty balloon was obtained and prepped from the back table.  This was placed over the glidewire into the area of stenosis and inflated to 14 mmHg pressure and then deflated.  The balloon was then removed over the wire and repeat fistulogram was performed which demonstrated significant improvement.  However, there is still a remainder of residual stenosis.  The 5-mm balloon was placed over the wire again and a repeat angioplasty was performed.  The balloon was then removed over the wire and a repeat angiogram was performed which demonstrated again an area of stenosis right at the anastomosis.  The glidewire was removed and a 0.014 guide wire was then obtained and placed through the sheath and across the brachial anastomosis and into the radial artery.  A 4 x 20 mm cutting balloon was obtained and prepped on the back table.  The 5 French sheath was then exchanged for a 6 French sheath.  The balloon was then placed over the 0.014 guide wire into the area of stenosis and then inflated to normal pressures at 8 mmHg.  The balloon was then deflated and removed over the wire.  A 5 mm x 20 mm balloon was obtained and prepped and placed over the wire into the area of stenosis and inflated to pressures of 14 mmHg.  A repeat fistulogram was performed after the removal of the balloon which demonstrated excellent results with no significant residual stenosis.  The patient actually had a nice palpable thrill at this point.  The fistulogram of the distal cephalic vein at the subclavian anastomosis was performed which demonstrated a mild area of stenosis.  The sheath was removed and blood pressure was held over the puncture site for approximately 10 minutes.,After hemostasis was achieved, the cephalic vein again was visualized with bevel ultrasound.  The proximal cephalic vein was then cannulated after injecting the skin overlying the vessel with a 1% lidocaine solution.  A 5 French micropuncture introducer sheath was then placed over the wire into the proximal cephalic vein.  A repeat fistulogram was performed which demonstrated an area of stenosis within the distal cephalic vein just prior to the subclavian vein confluence.  The 5 French introducer sheath was then exchanged for a 5 French sheath.  The 5 mm x 20 mm balloon was placed over a 0.035 glidewire across the area of stenosis.  The balloon was inflated to 14 mmHg.  The balloon was then deflated and a repeat fistulogram was performed through the sheath which demonstrated good results.  The sheath was then removed and blood pressure was held over the puncture site for approximately 10 minutes.  After adequate hemostasis was achieved, the area was cleansed in 2x2 and Tegaderm was applied.  The patient tolerated the procedure without any complications.  I was present for the entire case.  The sponge, instrument, and needle counts are correct at the end of the case.  The patient was subsequently taken to PACU in stable condition.,ANGIOGRAPHIC FINDINGS:,  The initial left arm brachiocephalic fistulogram demonstrated a stenosis at the brachial artery anastomosis and distally within the cephalic vein.  After standard balloon angioplasty, there was a mild improvement but some residual area of stenosis remained at the anastomosis.  Then postcutting balloon angioplasty, venogram demonstrated a significant improvement without any evidence of significant stenosis.,Fistulogram of the proximal cephalic vein demonstrated a stenosis just prior to the confluence with the left subclavian vein.  Postangioplasty demonstrated excellent results with the standard balloon.  There was no evidence of any contrast extravasation.,IMPRESSION,1.  High-grade stenosis involving the cephalic vein at the brachial artery anastomosis and distally.  Postcutting balloon and standard balloon angioplasty demonstrated excellent results without any evidence of contrast extravasation.,2.

He states that since that time these symptoms have been progressive and now involving his legs above his knees as well as his hands.  More recently, he describes a burning sensation along with numbness.  This has become a particular problem and of all the problems he has he feels that pain is his primary concern.  Over the last six months, he has noticed that he cannot feel hot objects in his hands and that objects slip out of his hands.  He denies any weakness per se, just clumsiness and decreased sensation.  He has also been complaining of brief muscle jerks, which occur in both hands and his shoulders.  This has been a fairly longstanding problem, and again has become more prevalent recently.  He does not have any tremor.  He denies any neck pain.  He walks with the aid of a walker because of unsteadiness with gait.,Recently, he has tried gabapentin, but this was not effective for pain control.  Oxycodone helps somewhat and gives him at least three hours pain relief.  Because of the pain, he has significant problems with fractured sleep.  He states he has not had a good night's sleep in many years.  About six months ago, after an MI and pacemaker insertion, he was transferred to a nursing facility.  At that facility, his insulin was stopped.  Since then he has only been on oral medication for his diabetes.

A full general and neurological examination was performed on the patient and is documented on the chart.,The patient is obese with significant ankle edema.,Neurological examination reveals normal cognitive exam and normal cranial nerve examination.  Motor examination reveals mild atrophy in bilateral FDIs, but still has a strong grip.  Individual muscle strength is close to normal with only subtle weakness found in ankle plantar and dorsiflexion.  Tone and bulk are normal.

Symptoms are predominantly sensory and severely dysfunctioning, with the patient having inability to ambulate independently as well as difficulty with grip and temperature differentiation in his upper extremities.  He has relative preservation of motor function.  Because these symptoms are progressive and, by report, he came off his insulin, suggesting somewhat mild diabetes, I would like to rule out other causes of progressive neuropathy.,2.  He has history of myoclonic jerks.  I did not see any on my examination today and I feel that these are benign and probably secondary to his severe insomnia, which he states is secondary to the painful neuropathy.  I would like to rule out other causes such as hepatic encephalopathy., ,I have recommended the following:,1.  EMG/nerve conduction study to assess severity of neuropathy and to characterize neuropathy.,2.  Blood work, looking for other causes of neuropathy and myoclonus, to include CBC, CMP, TSH, LFT, B12, RPR, ESR, Lyme titer, and HbA1c, and ammonia level.,3.  Neurontin and oxycodone have not been effective, and I have recommended Cymbalta starting at 30 mg q.d. for five days and then increasing to 60 mg q.d.

A lid speculum was applied to the right eye, and a stab incision into the anterior chamber was done close to the limbus at about the 1 o'clock position with a Superblade, and Xylocaine 1% preservative free 0.25 mL was injected into the anterior chamber, which was then followed by Healon to deepen the anterior chamber. Using a keratome, another stab incision was done close to the limbus at about the 9 o'clock position and with the Utrata forceps, anterior capsulorrhexis was performed, and the torn anterior capsule was totally removed. Hydrodissection and hydrodelineation were performed with the tuberculin syringe filled with BSS. The tip of the phaco unit was introduced into the anterior chamber, and anterior sculpting of the nucleus was performed until about more than two-thirds of the nucleus was removed. Using the phaco tip and the Drysdale hook, the nucleus was broken up into 4 pieces and then phacoemulsified.,The phaco tip was then exchanged for the aspiration/irrigation tip, and cortical materials were aspirated. Posterior capsule was polished with a curette polisher, and Healon was injected into the capsular bag. Using the Monarch intraocular lens inserter, the posterior chamber intraocular lens model SN60WF power +19.50 was placed into the inserter after applying some Healon, and the tip of the inserter was gently introduced through the cornea tunnel wound, into the capsular bag and then the intraocular lens was then inserted inferior haptic first into the back and the superior haptic was placed into the bag with the same instrument. Intraocular lens was then rotated about half a turn with a collar button hook. Healon was removed with the aspiration/irrigation tip, and balanced salt solution was injected through the side port to deepen the anterior chamber. It was found that there was no leakage of fluid through the cornea tunnel wound. For this reason, no suture was applied. Vigamox, Econopred and Nevanac eye drops were instilled and the eye was covered with a perforated shield. The patient tolerated the procedure well. There were no complications.\",\n",

She, therefore, comes back to the operating room for a new PD catheter.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE:  ,After the induction of general anesthetic, the abdomen was prepped and draped in the usual manner.  A small transverse right upper quadrant incision was made and carried down through the skin and subcutaneous tissue with sharp dissection.  The fascia was divided and the posterior fascia and peritoneum were identified.  A hole was made in the posterior fascia through the peritoneum and into the peritoneal cavity.  The omentum came up through the hole and so therefore the omentum was actually brought up and a small portion of it removed, which could easily be brought up through the incision.  A PD catheter was then placed into the pelvis over a guidewire.  At this point, the peritoneum and posterior fascia was closed around the catheter.  The anterior fascia was then closed over the top of the cuff leaving the cuff buried in the fascia.  The second incision was then made lateral and the catheter brought out through a second incision and the subcutaneous cuff then positioned at that site.

An intraaortic balloon pump was placed for cardiogenic shock, and then he was transferred to the ABCD Hospital on October 22, 2006, for continued critical care.  He was in a state of cardiogenic shock and multiorgan system failure including respiratory failure and acute renal insufficiency when he was transferred.  He is currently on dialysis due to end-stage renal disease and has a tracheostomy.  He is receiving fentanyl since he has been here for back pain, leg pain, abdominal pain, and pain in the feet.  He states that he is currently in pain and the fentanyl only helps for about an hour or so before the pain resumes.  He currently rates his pain as 7 out of 10.  He denies a depressed mood or anxiety and states that he knows he is getting better.  He describes his sleep as erratic and states that he will sleep for 1 hour after giving fentanyl IV and then will wake up until he gets another fentanyl.  He has PEG for tube feeding.  He has weakness on left side of his body as well as both legs since his MI.  He has been switched from fentanyl IV q.2h. to the fentanyl patch today.

Left subclavian access under fluoroscopic guidance.,2.  Left subclavian venogram under fluoroscopic evaluation.,3.  Insertion of ventricular lead through left subclavian approach and ventricular lead is Boston Scientific Dextrose model 12345, serial number 123456.,4.  Insertion of single-chamber pacemaker implantation, Altrua, serial number 123456.,5.  Closure of the pocket after formation of pocket for pacemaker.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:  ,The procedure was explained to the patient with risks and benefits.  The patient agreed and signed the consent form.  The patient was brought to the cath lab, draped and prepped in the usual sterile fashion, received 1.5 mg of versed and 25 mg of Benadryl for conscious sedation.,Access to the right subclavian was successful after the second attempt.  The first attempt accessed the left subclavian artery.  The needle was removed and manual compression applied for five minutes followed by re-accessing the subclavian vein successfully.  The J-wire was introduced into the left subclavian vein.,The anterior wall chest was anesthetized with lidocaine 2%, 2-inch incision using a #10 blade was used.,The pocket was formed using blunt dissection as he was using the Bovie cautery for hemostasis.  The patient went asystole during the procedure.  The transcutaneous pacer was used.  The patient was oxygenating well.  The patient had several compression applied by the nurse.  However, her own rhythm resolved spontaneously and the percutaneous pacer was kept on standby.,After that, the J-wire was tunneled into the pocket and then used to put the #7-French sheath into the left subclavian vein.  The lead from the Boston Scientific Dextrose model 12345, serial number 12345 was inserted through the left subclavian to the right atrium; however, it was difficult to really enter the right ventricle; and while the lead was in place, the side port of the sheath was used to inject 15 mL of contrast to assess the subclavian and the right atrium.  The findings were showing different anatomy, may be consistent with persistent left superior vena cava, and the angle to the right ventricle was different.  At that point, the lead stylet was reshaped and was able to cross the tricuspid valve in a position consistent with the mid septal place.,At that point, the lead was actively fixated.  The stylet was removed.  The R-wave measured at 40 millivolts.  The impedance was 580 and the threshold was 1.3 volt.  The numbers were accepted and because of the patient's fragility and the different anatomy noticed in the right atrium, concern about putting a second lead with re-access of the subclavian was high.  I decided to proceed with a single-chamber pacemaker as a backup system.,After that, the lead sleeve was used to actively fixate the lead in the anterior chest with two Ethibond sutures in the usual fashion.,The lead was attached to the pacemaker in the header.  The pacemaker was single-chamber pacemaker Altura 60, serial number 123456.  After that, the pacemaker was put in the pocket.  Pocket was irrigated with normal saline and was closed into two layers, deep interrupted #3-0 Vicryl and surface as continuous #4-0 Vicryl continuous.,The pacemaker was programmed as VVI 60, and with history is 10 to 50 beats per minute.  The lead position will be evaluated with chest x-ray.,No significant bleeding noticed.,CONCLUSION:  ,Successful single-chamber pacemaker implantation with left subclavian approach and venogram to assess the subclavian access site and the right atrial or right ventricle with asystole that resolved spontaneously during the procedure.  No significant bleed.\",\n",

She had a medial breech of a right L4 pedicle screw.  We took her back to the operating room same night and reinserted the screw.  Postoperatively, her pain had improved.,I had last seen her on 06/28/07 at which time she was doing well.  She had symptoms of what she thought was \"restless leg syndrome\" at that time.  She has been put on ReQuip for this.,She returned.  I had spoken to her 2 days ago and she had stated that her right lower extremity pain was markedly improved.  I had previously evaluated this for a pain possibly relating to deep venous thrombosis and ultrasound was negative.  She states that she had recurrent left lower extremity pain, which was similar to the pain she had preoperatively but in a different distribution, further down the leg.  Thus, I referred her for a lumbar spine radiograph and lumbar spine MRI and she presents today for evaluation.,She states that overall, she is improved compared to preoperatively.  She is ambulating better than she was preoperatively.  The pain is not as severe as it was preoperatively.  The right leg pain is improved.  The left lower extremity pain is in a left L4 and L5 distribution radiating to the great toe and first web space on the left side.,She denies any significant low back pain.  No right lower extremity symptoms.,No infectious symptoms whatsoever.  No fever, chills, chest pain, shortness of breath.  No drainage from the wound.  No difficulties with the incision.,FINDINGS:  ,On examination, Ms. ABC is a pleasant, well-developed, well-nourished female in no apparent distress.  Alert and oriented x 3.  Normocephalic, atraumatic.  Respirations are normal and nonlabored.  Afebrile to touch.,Left tibialis anterior strength is 3 out of 5, extensor hallucis strength is 2 out of 5.  Gastroc-soleus strength is 3 to 4 out of 5.  This has all been changed compared to preoperatively.  Motor strength is otherwise 4 plus out of 5.  Light touch sensation decreased along the medial aspect of the left foot.  Straight leg raise test normal bilaterally.,The incision is well healed.  There is no fluctuance or fullness with the incision whatsoever.  No drainage.,Radiographs obtained today demonstrate pedicle screw placement at L4 and L5 bilaterally without evidence of malposition or change in orientation of the screws.,Lumbar spine MRI performed on 07/03/07 is also reviewed.,It demonstrates evidence of adequate decompression at L4 and L5.  There is a moderate size subcutaneous fluid collection seen, which does not appear compressive and may be compatible with normal postoperative fluid collection, especially given the fact that she had a revision surgery performed.,ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  ,Ms. ABC is doing relatively well status post L4 and L5 laminectomy and bilateral foraminotomies, and posterior spinal fusion with instrumentation on 07/08/07.  The case is significant for merely misdirected right L4 pedicle screw, which was reoriented with subsequent resolution of symptoms.,I am uncertain with regard to the etiology of the symptoms.  However, it does appear that the radiographs demonstrate appropriate positioning of the instrumentation, no hardware shift, and the MRI demonstrates only a postoperative suprafascial fluid collection.  I do not see any indication for another surgery at this time.,I would also like to hold off on an interventional pain management given the presence of the fluid collection to decrease the risk of infection.,My recommendation at this time is that the patient is to continue with mobilization.  I have reassured her that her spine appears stable at this time.  She is happy with this.,I would like her to continue ambulating as much as possible.  She can go ahead and continue with ReQuip for the restless leg syndrome as her primary care physician has suggested.  I have also her referred to Mrs. Khan at Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation for continued aggressive management.,I will see her back in followup in 3 to 4 weeks to make sure that she continues to improve.  She knows that if she has any difficulties, she may follow up with me sooner.',\n",

She has always been stable on room air; however, because of her age and her early diagnosis, she was admitted for observation as RSV bronchiolitis typically worsens the third and fourth day of illness.  She was treated per pathway orders.  However, on the second day of admission, the patient was not quite eating well and parents live far away and she did have a little bit of trouble on first night of admission.  There was a heart murmur that was heard that sounded innocent, but yet there was no chest x-ray that was obtained.  We did obtain a chest x-ray, which did show a slight perihilar infiltrate in the right upper lobe.  However, the rest of the lungs were normal and the heart was also normal.  There were no complications during her hospitalization and she continued to be stable and eating better.  On day 2 of the admission, it was decided she was okay to go home.

       " 'TITLE OF OPERATION: , Right suboccipital craniectomy for resection of tumor using the microscope modifier 22 and cranioplasty.,INDICATION FOR SURGERY: , The patient with a large 3.5 cm acoustic neuroma.  The patient is having surgery for resection.  There was significant cerebellar peduncle compression.  The tumor was very difficult due to its size as well as its adherence to the brainstem and the nerve complex.  The case took 12 hours.  This was more difficult and took longer than the usual acoustic neuroma.,PREOP DIAGNOSIS: , Right acoustic neuroma.,POSTOP DIAGNOSIS: , Right acoustic neuroma.,PROCEDURE:,  The patient was brought to the operating room.  General anesthesia was induced in the usual fashion.  After appropriate lines were placed, the patient was placed in Mayfield 3-point head fixation, hold into a right park bench position to expose the right suboccipital area.  A time-out was settled with nursing and anesthesia, and the head was shaved, prescrubbed with chlorhexidine, prepped and draped in the usual fashion.  The incision was made and cautery was used to expose the suboccipital bone.  Once the suboccipital bone was exposed under the foramen magnum, the high speed drill was used to thin out the suboccipital bone and the craniectomy carried out with Leksell and insertion with Kerrison punches down to the rim of the foramen magnum as well as laterally to the edge of the sigmoid sinus and superiorly to the edge of the transverse sinus.  The dura was then opened in a cruciate fashion, the cisterna magna was drained, which nicely relaxed the cerebellum.  The dura leaves were held back with the 4-0 Nurolon.  The microscope was then brought into the field, and under the microscope, the cerebellar hemisphere was elevated.  Laterally, the arachnoid was very thick.  This was opened with bipolar and microscissors and this allowed for the cerebellum to be further mobilized until the tumor was identified.  The tumor was quite large and filled up the entire lateral aspect of the right posterior fossa.  Initially two retractors were used, one on the tentorium and one inferiorly.  The arachnoid was taken down off the tumor.  There were multiple blood vessels on the surface, which were bipolared.  The tumor surface was then opened with microscissors and the Cavitron was used to began debulking the lesion.  This was a very difficult resection due to the extreme stickiness and adherence to the cerebellar peduncle and the lateral cerebellum; however, as the tumor was able to be debulked, the edge began to be mobilized.  The redundant capsule was bipolared and cut out to get further access to the center of the tumor.  Working inferiorly and then superiorly, the tumor was taken down off the tentorium as well as out the 9th, 10th or 11th nerve complex.  It was very difficult to identify the 7th nerve complex.  The brainstem was identified above the complex.  Similarly, inferiorly the brainstem was able to be identified and cotton balls were placed to maintain this plain.  Attention was then taken to try identify the 7th nerve complex.  There were multitude of veins including the lateral pontine vein, which were coming right into this area.  The lateral pontine vein was maintained.  Microscissors and bipolar were used to develop the plain, and then working inferiorly, the 7th nerve was identified coming off the brainstem.  A number 1 and number 2 microinstruments were then used to began to develop the plane.  This then allowed for the further appropriate plane medially to be identified and cotton balls were then placed.  A number 11 and number 1 microinstrument continued to be used to free up the tumor from the widely spread out 7th nerve.  Cavitron was used to debulk the lesion and then further dissection was carried out.  The nerve stimulated beautifully at the brainstem level throughout this.  The tumor continued to be mobilized off the lateral pontine vein until it was completely off.  The Cavitron was used to debulk the lesion out back laterally towards the area of the porus.  The tumor was debulked and the capsule continued to be separated with number 11microinstrument as well as the number 1 microinstrument to roll the tumor laterally up towards the porus.  At this point, the capsule was so redundant, it was felt to isolate the nerve in the porus.  There was minimal bulk remaining intracranially.  All the cotton balls were removed and the nerve again stimulated beautifully at the brainstem.  Dr. X then came in and scrubbed into the case to drill out the porus and remove the piece of the tumor that was left in the porus and coming out of the porus.,I then scrubbed back into case once Dr. X had completed removing this portion of the tumor.  There was no tumor remaining at this point.  I placed some Norian in the porus to seal any air cells, although there were no palpated.  An intradural space was then irrigated thoroughly.  There was no bleeding.  The nerve was attempted to be stimulated at the brainstem level, but it did not stimulate at this time.  The dura was then closed with 4-0 Nurolons in interrupted fashion.  A muscle plug was used over one area.  Duragen was laid and strips over the suture line followed by Hemaseel.  Gelfoam was set over this and then a titanium cranioplasty was carried out.  The wound was then irrigated thoroughly.  O Vicryls were used to close the deep muscle and fascia, 3-0 Vicryl for subcutaneous tissue, and 3-0 nylon on the skin.,The patient was extubated and taken to the ICU in stable condition.',\n",

Due to the severe cramping, a decision to undergo vacuum D&C was made.  At the time of the procedure, moderate amount of tissue was obtained.,PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was taken to the operating room and placed in a supine position, at which time a general form of anesthesia was administered by the anesthesia department.  The patient was then repositioned in a modified dorsal lithotomy position and then prepped and draped in the usual fashion.  A weighted vaginal speculum was placed in the posterior vaginal vault.  Anterior lip of the cervix was grasped with single tooth tenaculum, and the cervix was dilated to approximately 8 mm straight.  Plastic curette was placed into the uterine cavity and suction was applied at 60 mmHg to remove the tissue.  This was followed by gentle curetting of the lining as well as followed by suction curetting and then another gentle curetting and a final suction.  Methargen 0.2 mg was given IM and Pitocin 40 units and a 1000 was also started at the time of the procedure.

Thyroid isthmusectomy.,ANESTHESIA: , General endotracheal tube.,BLOOD LOSS: , Minimal, less than 25 cc.,INDICATIONS:,  The patient is a 50-year-old gentleman who presented to the Emergency Department who had had multiple massive strokes.  He had required ventilator assistance and was transported to the ICU setting.  Because of the numerous deficits from the stroke, he is expected to have a prolonged ventilatory course and he will be requiring long-term care.,PROCEDURE: , After all risks, benefits, and alternatives were discussed with multiple family members in detail, informed consent was obtained.  The patient was brought to the Operative Suite where he was placed in supine position and general anesthesia was delivered through the existing endotracheal tube.  The neck was then palpated and marked appropriately in the cricoid cartilage sternal notch and thyroid cartilage marked appropriately with felt-tip marker.  The skin was then anesthetized with a mixture of 1% lidocaine and 1:100,000 epinephrine solution.  The patient was prepped and draped in usual fashion.  The surgeons were gowned and gloved.  A vertical skin incision was then made with a #15 blade scalpel extending from approximately two fingerbreadths above the level of the sternum approximately 1 cm above the cricoid cartilage.  Blunt dissection was then carried down until the fascia overlying the strap muscles were identified.  At this point, the midline raphe was identified and the strap muscles were separated utilizing the Bovie cautery.  Once the strap muscles have been identified, palpation was performed to identify any arterial aberration.  A high-riding innominate was not identified.  At this point, it was recognized that the thyroid gland was overlying the trachea could not be mobilized.  Therefore, dissection was carried down through to the cricoid cartilage at which point hemostat was advanced underneath the thyroid gland, which was then doubly clamped and ligated with Bovie cautery.  Suture ligation with #3-0 Vicryl was then performed on the thyroid gland in a double interlocking fashion.  This cleared a significant portion of the trachea.  The overlying pretracheal fascia was then cleared with use of pressured forceps as well as Bovie cautery.  Now, a tracheal hook was placed underneath the cricoid cartilage in order to stabilize the trachea.  The second tracheal ring was identified.  The Bovie cautery reduced to create a tracheal window beneath the second tracheal ring that was inferiorly based.  At this point, the anesthetist was appropriately alerted to deflate the endotracheal tube cuff.  The airway was entered and inferior to the base, window was created.  The anesthetist then withdrew the endotracheal tube until the tip of the tube was identified.  At this point, a #8 Shiley tracheostomy tube was inserted freely into the tracheal lumen.  The balloon was inflated and the ventilator was attached.  He was immediately noted to have return of the CO2 waveform and was ventilating appropriately according to the anesthetist.  Now, all surgical retractors were removed.  The baseplate of the tracheostomy tube was sutured to the patient's skin with #2-0 nylon suture.  The tube was further secured around the patient's neck with IV tubing.  Finally, a drain sponge was placed.  At this point, procedure was felt to be complete.  The patient was returned to the ICU setting in stable condition where a chest x-ray is pending.\",\n",

The patient with continued symptoms of pelvic pain and hypermenorrhea and desired definitive surgical treatment.,FINDINGS AT THE TIME OF SURGERY: , Uterus is anteverted and boggy with a very narrow introitus with a palpable left adnexal mass.,On laparotomy, the uterus was noted to be slightly enlarged with fibroid change as well as a hemorrhagic appearing left adnexal mass.  The bowel, omentum, and appendix had a normal appearance.,PROCEDURE: , The patient was taken to the operative suite where anesthesia was found to be adequate.  She was then prepared and draped in normal sterile fashion.  A Pfannenstiel skin incision was made with a scalpel and carried through the underlying layer of fascia with the second scalpel.  The fascia was then incised in the midline.  The fascial incision was then extended laterally with Mayo scissors.  The superior aspect of the fascial incision was grasped with Kochers with the underlying rectus muscle dissected off bluntly and sharply with Mayo scissors.  Attention was then turned to the inferior aspect of this incision, which in a similar fashion was tented up with the underlying rectus muscle and dissected off bluntly and sharply with Mayo scissors.  The rectus muscle was then separated in the midline.  The peritoneum was identified, tented up with hemostats and entered sharply with Metzenbaum scissors.  The peritoneal incision was then extended superiorly and inferiorly with good visualization of the bladder.  The uterus and left adnexa were then palpated and brought out into the surgical field.  The fundus of the uterus was grasped with a Lahey clamp.  The GYN/Balfour retractor was placed.  The bladder blade was placed.  The bowel was packed away with moist laparotomy sponges and the extension through GYN/Balfour retractor was placed.  At this time, the patient's anatomy was surveyed and there was found to be a left hemorrhagic appearing adnexal mass.  Attention was first turned to the right round ligament, which was tented up with a Babcock and a small window was made beneath the round ligament with a hemostat.  It was then suture ligated with #0 Vicryl suture, transected with the broad ligament being skeletonized on both sides.  Next, the right ________ was isolated bluntly as the patient had a previous RSO.  This was then suture ligated with #0 Vicryl suture, doubly clamped with Kocher clamps, transected, and suture ligated with #0 Vicryl suture with a Heaney stitch.  Attention was then turned to the left round ligament, which was tented up with the Babcock.  Small window was made beneath it and the broad ligament with hemostat was then suture ligated with #0 Vicryl suture, transected, and skeletonized with the aid of Metzenbaums.  The left infundibulopelvic ligament was then bluntly isolated.  It was then suture ligated with #0 Vicryl suture, doubly clamped with Kocher clamps, and transected and suture ligated with #0 Vicryl suture with a Heaney stitch.  The bladder flap was then placed on tension with Allis clamps.  It was then dissected off of the lower uterine segment with the aid of Metzenbaum scissors and Russians.  It was then gently pushed off of lower uterine segment with the aid of a moist Ray-Tec.  The uterine arteries were then skeletonized bilaterally.,They were then clamped with straight Kocher clamps, transected, and suture ligated with #0 Vicryl suture.  The cardinal ligament and uterosacral complexes on both sides were then clamped with curved Kocher clamps.  These were then transected and suture ligated with #0 Vicryl suture.  The lower uterine segment was then grasped with Lahey clamps, at which time the cervix was already visible.  It was then entered with the last transection.  The cervix was grasped with a single-toothed tenaculum and the uterus, cervix, and left adnexa were amputated off the vagina with the aid of Jorgenson scissors.  The angles of the vaginal cuff were then grasped with Kocher clamps.  A Betadine-soaked Ray-Tec was then pushed into the vagina and the vaginal cuff was closed with #0 Vicryl suture in a running lock fashion with care taken to transect the ipsilateral cardinal ligament, at which time the suction tip was changed and copious suction irrigation was performed.  Good hemostasis was appreciated.  A figure-of-eight suture in the center of the vaginal cuff was placed with #0 Vicryl.  This was tagged for later use.  The uterosacrals on both sides were incorporated into the vaginal cuff with the aid of #0 Vicryl suture.  The round ligaments were then pulled into the vaginal cuff using the figure-of-eight suture placed in the center of the vaginal cuff and these were tied in place.  The pelvis was then again copiously suctioned irrigated and hemostasis was appreciated.  The peritoneal surfaces were then reapproximated with the aid of #3-0 Vicryl suture in a running fashion.  The GYN/Balfour retractor and bladder blade were then removed.  The bowel was then packed.  Again copious suction irrigation was performed with hemostasis appreciated.  The peritoneum was then reapproximated with #2-0 Vicryl suture in a running fashion.  The fascia was then reapproximated with #0 Vicryl suture in a running fashion.  The Scarpa's  fascia was then reapproximated with #3-0 plain gut in a running fashion and the skin was closed with #4-0 undyed Vicryl in a subcuticular fashion.  Steri-Strips were placed.  At the end of the procedure, the sponge that was pushed into the vagina previously was removed and hemostasis was appreciated vaginally.

It has been progressively getting more painful at this time.  The patient attempted conservative treatment including wider shoe gear without long-term relief of symptoms and desires surgical treatment.,PROCEDURE: , An IV was instituted by the Department of Anesthesia in the preop holding area.  The patient was transported to the operating room and placed on the operating table in the supine position with a safety belt across her lap.  Copious amount of Webril were placed around the left ankle followed by a blood pressure cuff.  After adequate sedation was achieved by the Department of Anesthesia, a total of 15 cc of 0.5% Marcaine plain was injected in a Mayo and digital block to the left foot.  The foot was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile orthopedic fashion.  The foot was elevated from the operating table and exsanguinated with an Esmarch bandage.  The pneumatic ankle tourniquet was inflated to 250 mmHg and the foot was lowered to the operating table.  The stockinette was reflected.  The foot was cleansed with wet and dry sponge.  Attention was then directed to the first metatarsophalangeal joint of the left foot.  An incision was created over this area approximately 6 cm in length.  The incision was deepened with a #15 blade.  All vessels encountered were ligated for hemostasis.  The skin and subcutaneous tissue was then dissected from the capsule.  Care was taken to preserve the neurovascular bundle.  Dorsal linear capsular incision was then created.  The capsule was then reflected from the head of the first metatarsal.  Attention was then directed to the first interspace where a lateral release was performed.  A combination of sharp and blunt dissection was performed until the abductor tendons were identified and transected.  A lateral capsulotomy was performed.  Attention was then directed back to the medial eminence where sagittal saw was used to resect the prominent medial eminence.  The incision was then extended proximally with further dissection down to the level of the bone.  Two 0.45 K-wires were then inserted as access guides for the SCARF osteotomy.  A standard SCARF osteotomy was then performed.  The head of the first metatarsal was then translocated laterally in order to reduce the first interspace in the metatarsal angle.  After adequate reduction of the bunion deformity was noted, the bone was temporarily fixated with a 0.45 K-wire.  A 3.0 x 12 mm screw was then inserted in the standard AO fashion with compression noted.  A second 3.0 x 14 mm screw was also inserted with tight compression noted.  The remaining prominent medial eminence medially was then resected with a sagittal saw.  Reciprocating rasps were then used to smooth any sharp bony edges.  The temporary fixation wires were then removed.  The screws were again checked for tightness, which was noted.  Attention was directed to the medial capsule where a medial capsulorrhaphy was performed.  A straight stat was used to assist in removing a portion of the capsule.  The capsule was then reapproximated with #2-0 Vicryl medially.  Dorsal capsule was then reapproximated with #3-0 Vicryl in a running fashion.  The subcutaneous closure was performed with #4-0 Vicryl followed by running subcuticular stitch with #5-0 Vicryl.  The skin was then closed with #4-0 nylon in a horizontal mattress type fashion.,Attention was then directed to the left second toe.  A dorsal linear incision was then created over the proximal phalangeal joint of the left second toe.  The incision was deepened with a #15 blade and the skin and subcutaneous tissue was dissected off the capsule to be aligned laterally.  An incision was made on either side of the extensor digitorum longus tendon.  A curved mosquito stat was then used to reflex the tendon laterally.  The joint was identified and the medial collateral ligamentous attachments were resected off the head of the proximal phalanx.  A sagittal saw was then used to resect the head of the proximal head.  The bone was then rolled and the lateral collateral attachments were transected and the bone was removed in toto.  The extensor digitorum longus tendon was inspected and noted to be intact.  Any sharp edges were then smoothed with reciprocating rasp.  The area was then flushed with copious amounts of sterile saline.  The skin was then reapproximated with #4-0 nylon.  Dressings consisted of Owen silk, 4x4s, Kling, Kerlix, and Coban.  Pneumatic ankle tourniquet was released and an immediate hyperemic flush was noted to all five digits of the left foot.

Laparoscopically, the patient has large omental to anterior abdominal wall adhesions along the left side of the abdomen extending down to the left adnexa.  There are adhesions involving the right ovary to the anterior abdominal wall and the bowel.  There are also adhesions from the omentum to the anterior abdominal wall near the liver.  The uterus and ovaries appear within normal limits other than the adhesions.  The left fallopian tube grossly appeared within normal limits.  The right fallopian tube was not well visualized but appeared grossly scarred and no tubal end was visualized.  There was a large area of endometriosis, approximately 1 cm wide in the left ovarian fossa and there was a small spot of endometriosis in the posterior cul-de-sac.  There was also vesicular appearing endometriosis lesion in the posterior cul-de-sac.,PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was taken in the operating room and generalized anesthetic was administered.  She was then positioned in the dorsal lithotomy position and prepped and draped in the normal sterile fashion.  After exam under anesthetic, weighted speculum was placed in the vagina.  The anterior lip of the cervix was grasped with vulsellum tenaculum.  The uterus was sounded and then was serially dilated with Hank dilators to a size 10 Hank, then the uterine manipulator was inserted and attached to the anterior lip of the cervix.  At this point, the vulsellum tenaculum was removed along with the weighted speculum and attention was turned towards the abdomen.  An approximately 2 cm incision was made immediately inferior to the umbilicus with the skin knife.  The superior aspect of the umbilicus was grasped with a towel clamp.  The abdomen was tented up and a Veress needle inserted through this incision.  When the Veress needle was felt to be in place, deep position was checked by placing saline in the needle.  This was seen to freely drop in the abdomen so it was connected to CO2 gas.  Again, this was started at the lowest setting, was seen to flow freely, so it was advanced to the high setting.  The abdomen was then insufflated to an adequate distention.  Once an adequate distention was reached, the CO2 gas was disconnected.  The Veress needle was removed and a size #11 step trocar was placed.  Next, the laparoscope was inserted through this port.  The medial port was connected to CO2 gas.  Next, a 1 cm incision was made in the midline approximately 2 fingerbreadths above the pubic symphysis.  Through this, a Veress needle was inserted followed by size #5 step trocar and this procedure was repeated under direct visualization on the right upper quadrant lateral to the umbilicus and a size #5 trocar was also placed.  Next, a grasper was placed through the suprapubic port.  This was used to grasp the bowel that was adhesed to the right ovary and the Harmonic scalpel was then used to lyse these adhesions.  Bowel was carefully examined afterwards and no injuries or bleeding were seen.  Next, the adhesions touching the right ovary and anterior abdominal wall were lysed with the Harmonic scalpel and this was done without difficulty.  There was a small amount of bleeding from the anterior abdominal wall peritoneum.  This was ablated with the Harmonic scalpel.  The Harmonic scalpel was used to lyse and ablate the endometriosis in the left ovarian fossa and the posterior cul-de-sac.  Both of these areas were seen to be hemostatic.  Next, a grasper was placed and was used to bluntly remove the vesicular lesion from the posterior cul-de-sac.  This was sent to pathology.  Next, the pelvis was copiously irrigated with the Nezhat dorsi suction irrigator and the irrigator was removed.  It was seen to be completely hemostatic.  Next, the two size #5 ports were removed under direct visualization.  The camera was removed.  The abdomen was desufflated.  The size #11 introducer was replaced and the #11 port was removed.,Next, all the ports were closed with #4-0 undyed Vicryl in a subcuticular interrupted fashion.  The incisions were dressed with Steri-Strips and bandaged appropriately and the patient was taken to recovery in stable condition and she will be discharged home today with Darvocet for pain and she will follow-up in one week in the clinic for pathology results and to have a postoperative check.',\n",

A 50% distal left main and two-vessel coronary artery disease with normal left ventricular systolic function.,2.  Frequent PVCs.,3.  Metabolic syndrome.,PROCEDURES,1.  Left heart catheterization with left ventriculography.,2.  Selective coronary angiography.,COMPLICATIONS: , None.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: , After informed consent was obtained, the patient was brought to the Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory in fasting state.  Both groins were prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  Xylocaine 1% was used as local anesthetic.  Versed and fentanyl were used for conscious sedation.  Next, a #6-French sheath was placed in the right femoral artery using modified Seldinger technique.  Next, selective angiography of the left coronary artery was performed in multiple views using #6-French JL4 catheter.  Next, selective angiography of the right coronary artery was performed in multiple views using #6-French 3DRC catheter.  Next, a #6-French angle pigtail catheter was advanced into the left ventricle.  The left ventricular pressure was then recorded.  Left ventriculography was the performed using 36 mL of contrast injected over 3 seconds.  The left heart pull back was then performed.  The catheter was then removed.,Angiography of the right femoral artery was performed.  Hemostasis was obtained by Angio-Seal closure device.  The patient left the Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory in stable condition.,HEMODYNAMICS,1.  LV pressure was 163/0 with end-diastolic pressure of 17.  There was no significant gradient across the aortic valve.,2.  Left ventriculography showed old inferior wall hypokinesis.  Global left ventricular systolic function is normal.  Estimated ejection fraction was 58%.  There is no significant mitral regurgitation.,3.  Significant coronary artery disease.,4.  The left main is approximately 7 or 8 mm proximally.  It trifurcates into left anterior descending artery, ramus intermedius artery, and left circumflex artery.  The distal portion of the left main has an ulcerated excentric plaque, up to about 50% in severity.,5.  The left anterior descending artery is around 4 mm proximally.  It extends slightly beyond the apex into the inferior wall.  It gives rises to several medium size diagonal branches as well as small to medium size multiple septal perforators.  At the ostium of the left anterior descending artery, there was an eccentric plaque up to 70% to 80%, best seen in the shallow LAO with caudal angulation.,There was no other flow-limiting disease noted in the rest of the left anterior descending artery or its major branches.,The ramus intermedius artery is around 3 mm proximally, but shortly after its origin, it bifurcates into two medium size branches.  There was no significant disease noted in the ramus intermedius artery however.,The left circumflex artery is around 2.5 mm proximally.  It gave off a recurrent atrial branch and a small AV groove branch prior to terminating into a bifurcating medium size obtuse marginal branch.  The mid to distal circumflex has a moderate disease, which is relatively diffuse up to about 40% to 50%.,The right coronary artery is around 4 mm in diameter.  It gives off conus branch, two medium size acute marginal branches, relatively large posterior descending artery and a posterior lateral branch.  In the mid portion of the right coronary artery at the origin of the first acute marginal branch, there is a relatively discrete stenosis of about 80% to 90%.  Proximally, there is an area of eccentric plaque, but seem to be non-flow limiting, at best around 20% to 30%.  Additionally, there is what appears to be like a shell-like lesion in the proximal segment of the right coronary artery as well.  The posterior descending artery has an eccentric plaque of about 40% to 50% in its mid segment.,PLAN:  ,Plan to consult cardiovascular surgery for consideration of coronary artery bypass surgery.

She is under the care of Dr. Bonaparte for hyperlipidemia and hypothyroidism.  She has a long history of back and neck pain with multiple injuries in the 1960s, 1970s, 1980s and 1990s.  In 2000, she developed \"sciatica\" mostly in her right lower extremity.,She is seen today with no outside imaging, except with MRI of her cervical spine and lumbar spine dated February of 2004.  Her cervical MRI reveals an 8 mm central spinal canal at C6-7, multilevel foraminal stenosis, though her report is not complete as we do not have all the pages.  Her lumbar MRI reveals lumbar spinal stenosis at L4-5 with multilevel facet arthropathy and spondylitic changes.,The patient has essentially three major pain complaints.,Her first pain complaint is one of a long history of axial neck pain without particular radicular symptoms.  She complains of popping, clicking, grinding and occasional stiffness in her neck, as well as occasional periscapular pain and upper trapezius myofascial pain and spasms with occasional cervicalgic headaches.  She has been told by Dr. Megahed in the past that she is not considered a surgical candidate.  She has done physical therapy twice as recently as three years ago for treatment of her symptoms.  She complains of occasional pain and stiffness in both hands, but no particular numbness or tingling.,Her next painful complaint is one of midthoracic pain and thoracalgia features with some right-sided rib pain in a non-dermatomal distribution.  Her rib pain was not preceded by any type of vesicular rash and is reproducible, though is not made worse with coughing.  There is no associated shortness of breath.  She denies inciting trauma and also complains of pain along the costochondral and sternochondral junctions anteriorly.  She denies associated positive or negative sensory findings, chest pain or palpitations, dyspnea, hemoptysis, cough, or sputum production.  Her weight has been stable without any type of constitutional symptoms.,Her next painful complaint is one of axial low back pain with early morning pain and stiffness, which improves somewhat later in the day.  She complains of occasional subjective weakness to the right lower extremity.  Her pain is worse with sitting, standing and is essentially worse in the supine position.  Five years ago, she developed symptoms radiating in an L5-S1 distribution and within the last couple of years, began to develop numbness in the same distribution.

She has chronic osteoarthritic changes evident over both hands.  There is mild restriction of range of motion of the right shoulder, but no active impingement signs.,Inspection of the axial skeleton reveals a cervicothoracic head-forward posture with slight internal rotation of the upper shoulders.  Palpation of the axial skeleton reveals mild midline tenderness at the lower lumbar levels one fingerbreadth lateral to the midline.  There is no midline spinous process tenderness over the cervicothoracic regions.  Palpation of the articular pillars is met with mild provocation of pain.  Palpation of the right posterior, posterolateral and lateral borders of the lower ribs is met with mild provocable tenderness.  There is also tenderness at the sternochondral and costochondral junctions of the right, as well as the left bilaterally.  The xiphoid process is not particularly tender.  There is no dermatomal sensory abnormality in the thoracic spine appreciated.  Mild facetal features are evident over the sacral spine with extension and lateral bending at the level of the sacral ala.,Neurological examination of the upper and lower extremities reveals 3/5 reflexes of the biceps, triceps, brachioradialis, and patellar bilaterally.  I cannot elicit S1 reflexes.  There are no long tract signs.  Negative Hoffman\\'s, negative Spurling\\'s, no clonus, and negative Babinski.  Motor examination of the upper, as well as lower extremities appears to be intact throughout.  I may be able to detect a slight hand of atrophy of the right calf muscles, but this is truly unclear and no measurement was made.,SUMMARY OF DIAGNOSTIC IMAGING:,  As per above.,IMPRESSION:,1.  Osteoarthritis.,2.  Cervical spinal stenosis.,3.  Lumbar spinal stenosis.,4.  Lumbar radiculopathy, mostly likely at the right L5-S1 levels.,5.  History of mild spondylolisthesis of the lumbosacral spine at L4-L5 and right sacroiliac joint dysfunction.,6.  Chronic pain syndrome with myofascial pain and spasms of the trapezius and greater complexes.,PLAN:  ,The natural history and course of the disease was discussed in detail with Mr. XYZ.  Greater than 80 minutes were spent facet-to-face at this visit.  I have offered to re-image her cervical and lumbar spine and have included a thoracic MR imaging and rib series, as well as cervicolumbar flexion and extension views to evaluate for mobile segment and/or thoracic fractures.  I do not suspect any sort of intrathoracic comorbidity such as a neoplasm or mass, though this was discussed.  Pending the results of her preliminary studies, this should be ruled out.  I will see her in followup in about two weeks with the results of her scans.',\n",
       " 'HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , I was kindly asked to see Ms. ABC by Dr. X for cardiology consultation regarding preoperative evaluation for right hip surgery.  She is a patient with a history of coronary artery disease status post bypass surgery in 1971 who tripped over her oxygen last p.m. she states and fell.  She suffered a right hip fracture and is being considered for right hip replacement.  The patient denies any recent angina, but has noted more prominent shortness of breath.,Past cardiac history is significant for coronary artery disease status post bypass surgery, she states in 1971, I believe it was single vessel.  She has had stress test done in our office on September 10, 2008, which shows evidence of a small apical infarct, no area of ischemia, and compared to study of December of 2005, there is no significant change.  She had a transthoracic echocardiogram done in our office on August 29, 2008, which showed normal left ventricular size and systolic function, dilated right ventricle with septal flattening of the left ventricle consistent with right ventricular pressure overload, left atrial enlargement, severe tricuspid regurgitation with estimated PA systolic pressure between 75-80 mmHg consistent with severe pulmonary hypertension, structurally normal aortic and mitral valve.  She also has had some presumed atrial arrhythmias that have not been sustained.  She follows with Dr. Y my partner at Cardiology Associates.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  ,Other medical history includes severe COPD and she is oxygen dependent, severe pulmonary hypertension, diabetes, abdominal aortic aneurysm, hypertension, dyslipidemia.  Last ultrasound of her abdominal aorta done June 12, 2009 states that it was fusiform, infrarenal shaped aneurysm of the distal abdominal aorta measuring 3.4 cm unchanged from prior study on June 11, 2008.,MEDICATIONS:,  As an outpatient:,1.

She does not drink alcohol nor use illicit drugs.  She lives alone and is widowed.  She is a retired custodian at University.  Of note, she is accompanied with her verbal consent by her daughter and grandson at the bedside.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  ,Unable to obtain as the patient is somnolent from her pain medication, but she is alert and able to answer my direct questions.,PHYSICAL EXAM: , Height 5\\'2\", weight 160 pounds, temperature is 99.5 degrees ranging up to 101.6, blood pressure 137/67 to 142/75, pulse 92, respiratory rate 16, O2 saturation 93-89%.  On general exam, she is an elderly, chronically ill appearing woman in no acute distress.  She is able to lie flat, she does have pain if she moves.  HEENT shows the cranium is normocephalic, atraumatic.  She has dry mucosal membranes.  Neck veins are not distended.  There are no carotid bruits.  Visible skin is warm and she appears pale.  Affect appropriate and she is somnolent from her pain medications, but arouses easily and answers my direct questions appropriately.  Lungs are clear to auscultation anteriorly, no wheezes.  Cardiac exam S1, S2 regular rate, soft holosystolic murmur heard over the tricuspid region.  No rub nor gallop.  PMI is nondisplaced, unable to appreciate RV heave.  Abdomen soft, mildly distended, appears benign.  Extremities with trivial peripheral edema.  Pulses grossly intact.  She has quite a bit of pain at the right hip fracture.,DIAGNOSTIC/LABORATORY DATA:  ,Sodium 135, potassium 4.7, chloride 99, bicarbonate 33, BUN 22, creatinine 1.3, glucose 149, troponin was 0.01 followed by 0.04.

When compared to EKG done July 15, 2009 at 1948, previously there more frequent PVCs seen.  This ECG appears similar to the ones she has had done previously in our office including on June 11, 2009, although the T wave changes are a bit more prominent, which is a nonspecific finding.,IMPRESSION: , She is an 81-year-old woman with severe O2 requiring chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with evidence of right heart overload, as well as known coronary artery disease status post single-valve bypass in 1971 suffering a right hip fracture for whom a right hip replacement is being considered.  I have had a long discussion with the patient, as well as her daughter and grandson at the bedside today.  There are no clear absolute cardiac contraindications that I can see.  Of note at the time of this dictation a chest x-ray report is pending.  With that being said, however, she is extremely high risk more from a pulmonary than cardiac standpoint.  We did also however review that untreated hip fractures themselves have very high morbidity and mortality incidences.  The patient is deciding on surgery and is clearly aware that she is very high risk for proposed surgery, as well as if she were to not pursue surgery.,PLAN/RECOMMENDATIONS:,1.  The patient is going to decide on surgery.  If she does have the right hip surgery, I would recommend overnight observation in the intensive care unit.,2.  Optimize pulmonary function and pursue aggressive DVT prophylaxis.,3.  Continue digoxin and verapamil.  Again, the patient describes clear INTOLERANCE TO BETA BLOCKERS by her history.',\n",

Reports she has been not socializing with her family because of her worsening depression.  Husband notes that on Monday after speaking to Dr. X, they had been advised to alternate the patient\\'s Pamelor (nortriptyline) to every other day because the patient was reporting dry mouth.  They did as they have instructed and husband feels this may have had some factor on her worsening depression.  The patient decided to ingest the pills when her husband went to work on Friday.  She thought Friday would be a good day because there would be less medical people working so her chances of receiving medical care would be lessened.  Her husband left around 7 in the morning and returned around 11 and found her sleeping.  About 30 minutes after his arrival, he found the empty bottles and woke up the patient to bring her to the hospital.,She says she wishes she would have died, but is happy she is alive and is currently not suicidal because she notes her sons may be have to be tested for the Huntington gene.

The patient had agreed to the surgical procedure and the postoperative rehabilitation as needed.,DETAILS OF THE PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was brought to the operating room, placed supine on the operating room table, prepped and draped in the sterile fashion and was given sedation.  The patient was then given sedation.  Once this was complete, the area overlying the carpal ligament was carefully injected with 1% lidocaine with epinephrine.  The patient had this area carefully and thoroughly injected with approximately 10 mL of lidocaine with epinephrine and once this was complete, a 15-blade knife was then used to incise the skin opposite the radial aspect of the fourth ray.  Careful dissection under direct visualization was performed through the subcutaneous fat as well as through the palmar fascia.  A Weitlaner retractor was then used to retract the skin and careful dissection through the palmar fascia would then revealed the transverse carpal ligament.  This was then carefully incised using a 15-blade knife and once entry was again into the carpal canal, a Freer elevator was then inserted and under direct visualization, the carpal ligament was then released.  The transverse carpal ligament was carefully released first in the distal direction until palmar fat could be visualized and by palpation no further ligament could be felt.  The area was well hemostased with the 1% lidocaine with epinephrine and both proximal and distal dissection along the nerve was performed.  Visualization of the transverse carpal ligament was maintained with Weitlaner retractor as well as centric.  Both the centric and the Ragnell were used to retract both proximal and distal corners of the incision and the entirety of the area was under direct visualization at all times.  Palmar fascia was released both proximally and distally as well as the transverse carpal ligament.  Direct palpation of the carpal canal demonstrated a full and complete release.  Observation of the median nerve revealed an area of hyperemia in the distal two-thirds of the nerve, which demonstrated the likely area of compression.  Once this was complete, hemostasis was established using bipolar cautery and some small surface bleeders and irrigation of the area was performed and then the closure was achieved with 4-0 chromic suture in a horizontal mattress and interrupted stitch.  Xeroform was then applied to the incision.  A bulky dressing was then applied consisting of Kerlix and Ace wrap, and the patient was taken to the recovery room in stable condition without any complications.',\n",

She has been found to have tachybrady syndrome, has been referred for pacemaker implantation.,RISKS AND BENEFITS: , Risks, benefits, and alternatives of implantation of a single-chamber pacemaker were discussed with the patient.  The patient agreed both verbally and via written consent.  Risks that were discussed included but were not limited to bleeding, infection, vascular injury, cardiac perforation, stroke, myocardial infarction, need for urgent cardiovascular surgery, and death were discussed with the patient.  The patient agreed both verbally and via written consent.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: , The patient was transported to the cardiac catheterization laboratory in a fasting state.  The region of the left deltopectoral groove was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.  Lidocaine 1% (20 mL) was administered to the area.  Percutaneous access of the left axillary vein was then performed.  A wire was then advanced in the left axillary vein using fluoroscopy.  Following this, a 4-inch long transverse incision was made through the skin and subcutaneous tissue exposing the pectoral fascia and muscle beneath.  Lidocaine 1% (10 mL) was then administered to the medial aspect of the incision and a pocket was fashioned in the medial direction.  Using the previously placed guidewire, a 7-French sidearm sheath was advanced over the wire into the vein.  The dilator and wire were removed.  An active pacing lead was then advanced down in the right atrium.  The peel-away sheath was removed.  Lead was passed across the tricuspid valve and positioned in an apical septal location.  This was an active fixed lead and the screw was deployed.  Adequate pacing and sensing function were established.  The suture sleeve was then advanced to the entry point of the tissue and connected securely to the tissue.  The pocket was washed with antibiotic-impregnated saline.  A pulse generator was obtained and connected securely to the lead.  The lead was then carefully wrapped behind the pulse generator, and the entire system was placed in the pocket.

One 10-mm 2.0 partially threaded cannulated screw of the OsteoMed system.,DESCRIPTION OF THE PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was brought to the operating room and placed on the operating table in the supine position.  After adequate sedation was achieved by the anesthesia team, the above-mentioned anesthetic mixture was infiltrated directly into the patient's right foot to anesthetize the future surgical sites.  The right ankle was covered with cast padding and an 18-inch ankle tourniquet was placed around the right ankle and set up at 250 mmHg.  The right foot was then prepped, scrubbed, and draped in a normal sterile technique.  The right ankle tourniquet was then inflated.  Attention was then directed on the dorsomedial aspect of the first right metatarsophalangeal joint where a 6-cm linear incision was placed parallel and medial to the course of the extensor hallucis longus tendon to the right great toe.  The incision was deepened through subcutaneous tissues.  All the bleeders were identified, cut, clamped, and cauterized.  The incision was deepened to the level of the capsule and the periosteum of the first right metatarsophalangeal joint.  All the tendinous and neurovascular structures were identified and retracted from the site to be preserved.  Using sharp and dull dissection, the periosteal and capsular tissues were mobilized from the head and neck of the first right metatarsal and the base of the proximal phalanx of the right great toe.  The conjoint tendon was identified on the lateral plantar aspect of the base of the proximal phalanx and resected transversely.,A lateral capsulotomy was also performed at the level of the first right metatarsophalangeal joint.  Using sharp and dull dissection, the dorsomedial prominence of the first right metatarsal head was adequately exposed and resected with the use of a sagittal saw.  The same saw was used to perform the Austin osteotomy on the capital aspect of the first right metatarsal with its apex distal and its base proximal.  The dorsal arm of the osteotomy was longer than the plantar arm and noted to accommodate for the future internal fixation.  The capital fragment of the first right metatarsal was then transposed laterally and impacted on the shaft of the first right metatarsal.  Two wires of the OsteoMed system were also used as provisional fixation wires and also as guidewires for the insertion of the future screws.  The wires were inserted dorsal distal to plantar proximal through the dorsal arm of the osteotomy.  The two screws from the 3.0 OsteoMed system were inserted over the wires using AO technique.  One screw measured 16 mm, second screw measured 18 mm in length.  Both 3.0 screws were then evaluated for the fixation of the osteotomy after the wires were removed.  Fixation of the osteotomy was found to be excellent.  The dorsomedial prominence of the first right metatarsal shaft was then resected with the sagittal saw.  To improve the correction of the hallux abductus angle, an Akin osteotomy was also performed on the base of the proximal phalanx of the right great toe with its base medially and its apex laterally.  Upon removal of the base wedge from the base of the proximal phalanx, the osteotomy was reduced with the OsteoMed smooth wire, which was also used as a guidewire for the insertion of a 16-mm partially threaded cannulated screw from the OsteoMed 3.0 system.  Upon insertion of the screw, using AO technique, the wire was removed.  The screw was inserted proximal medial to distal lateral through the osteotomy of the base of the proximal phalanx of the right great toe.  Fixation of the osteotomy was found to be excellent.  Reduction of the bunion deformity was also found to be excellent and position of the first right metatarsophalangeal joint was found to be anatomical.  Range of motion of that joint was uninhibited.  The area was flushed copiously with saline.  Then, 3-0 suture material was used to approximate the periosteum and capsular tissues, 4-0 was used to approximate the subcutaneous tissues, and Steri-Strips were used to reinforce the incision.  Attention was directed over the neck of the second right metatarsal head where a 3-cm linear incision was placed directly over the surgical neck of the second right metatarsal.  The incision was deepened through subcutaneous tissues.  All the bleeders were identified, cut, clamped and cauterized.  The incision was deepened through the level of the periosteum over the surgical neck of the second right metatarsal.  All the tendinous and neurovascular structures were identified and retracted from the site to be preserved.  Using sharp and dull dissection, the surgical neck of the second right metatarsal was adequately exposed and then Weil-type osteotomy was performed from dorsal distal to plantar proximal through the surgical neck of the second right metatarsal.  The capital fragment was then transposed proximally and impacted on the shaft of the second right metatarsal.,The 2.0 Osteo-Med system was also used to fixate this osteotomy wire from that system was inserted dorsal proximal to plantar distal through the second right metatarsal osteotomy and the wire was used as a guidewire for the insertion of the 10-mm partially threaded 2.0 cannulated screw.  Upon insertion of the screw, using AO technique, the wire was then removed.  Fixation of the osteotomy with 2.0 screw was found to be excellent.  The second right metatarsophalangeal joint was then relocated and the dislocation of that joint was completely reduced.  Range of motion of the second right metatarsophalangeal joint was found to be excellent.  Then, 3-0 Vicryl suture material was used to approximate the periosteal tissues.  Then, 4-0 Vicryl was used to approximate the skin incision.  Attention was then directed at the level of the PIP joint of the second right toe where two semi-elliptical incisions were placed directly over the bony prominence at the level of the second right PIP joint.  The island of skin between the two semi-elliptical incisions was resected in toto.  The dissection was carried down to the level of extensor digitorum longus of the second right toe, which was resected transversely at the level of the PIP joint.  A capsulotomy and a medial and lateral collateral ligament release of the PIP joint of the second right toe was also performed and head of the proximal phalanx of the second right digit was adequately exposed.  Using the double-action bone cutter, the head of the proximal phalanx of the second right toe was then resected.  The area was copiously flushed with saline.  The capsular and periosteal tissues were approximated with 2-0 Vicryl and 3-0 Vicryl suture material was also used to approximate the extensor digitorum longus to the second right toe.  A 5-0 Prolene was used to approximate the skin edges of the two semi-elliptical incisions.  Correction of the hammertoe deformity and relocation of the second right metatarsophalangeal joint were evaluated with the foot loaded and were found to be excellent and anatomical.  At this time, the patient's three incisions were covered with Xeroform, copious amounts of fluff and Kling, stockinette, and Ace bandage.  The patient's right ankle tourniquet was deflated, time was 60 minutes.  Immediate hyperemia was noted on the entire right lower extremity upon deflation of the cuffs.,The patient's right foot was placed in a surgical shoe and the patient was transferred to the recovery room under the care of anesthesia team with the vital signs stable and the vascular status at appropriate levels.  The patient was given instructions and education on how to continue caring for her right foot surgery.  The patient was eventually discharged from Hospital according to nursing protocol and was advised to follow up with Dr. X's office in one week's time for her first postoperative appointment.\",\n",

Right ankle trimalleolar fracture.,2.  Right distal tibia plafond fracture with comminuted posterolateral impacted fragment.,TOURNIQUET TIME: , 80 minutes.,HISTORY: , This 50-year-old gentleman was from the area and riding his motorcycle in Kentucky.,The patient lost control of his motorcycle when he was traveling approximately 40 mile per hour.  He was on a curve and lost control.  He is unsure what exactly happened, but he thinks his right ankle was pinned underneath the motorcycle while he was sliding.  There were no other injuries.  He was treated in Kentucky.  A close reduction was performed and splint applied.  Orthopedic surgeon called myself with regards to this patient's fracture management and suggested a CT scan.  The patient returned to Ohio and his friend drove him all the way from Kentucky to Northwest Ohio overnight.  The patient showed up in the emergency department where a CT scan was asked to be performed.  This was performed and reviewed.  The patient, however, had significant amount of soft tissue swelling and therefore he was asked to follow up in 2 days.  At this time, he still had significant swelling, but because of the amount of swelling that he had particularly with the long car ride for many hours with his leg dependent, it was felt to be best to wait.,Indeed after 7 days, the patient started to develop fracture blisters on the posterior medial aspect of his ankle with large blisters measuring approximately 2 to 3 inches.  The patient was x-rayed in the office.  He had lost some of his reduction.  Therefore, he was re-reduced at approximately 7 days and then each time the patient had examination of tissues, he was re-reduced just to keep the pressure off the skin.,An x-ray showed the distal fibular fracture starting at the mortise region laterally.  It appeared as an abduction type injury with minimal rotation.  This was comminuted, fragmented, and impacted.,The medial malleolus fracture was an avulsion type.  The syndesmosis appeared to be intact.  This appeared as an AO type B fracture.  However, this was not a rotational injury.,There is a posterior malleolar fragment attached to the distal fibular fragment, which appeared to be avulsed as well, but comminuted.  CT scan revealed a more serious fracture with an anterior as well as posterior plafond fracture of an anterior fragment, which was undisplaced in the posterior medial corner.  A posterior Tillaux fragment appeared to be separate.  However, in this area, there was significant comminution in the mid portion of the ankle joint.,There were many fragments and defects in this region.,The medial mortise however appeared to be intact with regards to the tibial plafond even though there was an anterior undisplaced fragment.,We discussed delayed open reduction internal fixation with the patient.  He understood the risk of surgery including infection, decreased range of motion, stiffness, neurovascular injury, weakness, and numbness.  We discussed seriously the risk of osteoarthritis because of the comminution in the intraarticular surface shown on the CT scan.  We discussed deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, skin slough, skin necrosis, infection, and need for second surgery.  We discussed shortening, decreased strength, limited use, disability of operative extremity, malunion, nonunion, compartment syndrome, stiffness of the operative extremity, numbness, and weakness.  Examination of the patient revealed that he had slightly decreased sensation on the dorsum of his foot.,The patient was able to flex and extend his toes, had good capillary refill, good dorsalis pedis, and posterior tibial pulse.,The patient's tissues were edematous and we has waited approximately 10 days before performing the surgery when the skin could be wrinkled anteriorly.  We discussed his incision, the medial incision as well as lateral incision and the lateral incision would be more posterolateral to maintain a bridge of at least 6 to 8 cm between the 2 incisions.  We did discuss the skin slough as well as skin necrosis, particularly medially where the most skin pressure was because of displacement laterally.  He understood the posterolateral comminution of the tibial plafond, which would be reduced by aligning up the cortex posteriorly.,We discussed the posterolateral approach with reduction of the fibula.  We discussed that likely the distal fibula would not be removed completely to assess the articular surface as this would likely comminute the fibula, even more fragmentation would occur, and would not be able to obtain an anatomic reduction.  He understood this distal fibular fracture was comminuted and there were missing fragments of bone because they were impacted into intramedullary cancellous space.  With this, the patient understood that the hardware may necessitate removal as well in the future.  We discussed hardware irritation.  We also discussed risk of osteoarthritis, which was nearly 100% particularly because of comminution of this area posteriorly.  With these risks discussed and listed on the consent, the patient wanted the procedure.,OPERATIVE NOTE:,  The patient was brought to operating theater and given successful general anesthetic.  His right leg was prepped and draped in the usual fashion.  Before prep and drape was performed, a close reduction was tried to be obtained to see whether there was any obstruction to reduction.  It was felt that at one point the posterior tibialis tendon may be intraarticular.,The reduction appeared to line up.  However, there was significant gap of approximately 1.5 to 2 cm between the avulsed medial malleolus fragment and distal tibia.,A lateral incision was made over the fracture site approximately 8 cm long and was taken to subcutaneous tissue.  The superficial peroneal nerve was seen and this was avoided.  The incision was placed posterolateral to fibula.,This was to ensure good flap of tissue between the 2 incisions medial and laterally.  The fracture was seen.  The fracture was elevated and medialized and de-rotated.  The anterior portion of the distal fibula was significantly comminuted with defect.  The posterior aspect was still intact.  However, there were multiple fracture lines demonstrating a crush-type injury.  This was reduced manually.  At this point, dissection was performed bluntly behind the peroneal tendons in between this and flexor hallucis longus tendon.  No sharp dissection was performed.  The posterior malleolar fragment was palpated with the distal fibula reduced.  The posterior malleolar fragment appeared to be reduced as well.,X-ray views confirmed this.,An incision was made, standard incision, curvilinear, medially distal to the medial corner of the mortise and curving anterior and posteriorly around the tip of the medial malleolus.  This was taken only through subcutaneous tissue.  The saphenous vein was found, dissected out.  Its branches were cauterized.  Penrose drain was placed around this.,Dissection was undertaken.  The periosteal tissue was seen and was invaginated into the joint.,This was recovered and flipped back on both sides.  Next, the towel clip was used.  Ends were freshened up using irrigation.  The joint surface appeared to be congruent anteriorly and posteriorly medially.,Anatomic reduction was performed in the medial malleolus using 2 mm K-wires and exchanging these for a 35 mm and a 40 mm, anterior and posterior respectively, partially threaded cancellous screws.  Anatomic reduction was gained.  X-rays were taken showing excellent anatomic reduction.  Next, attention was drawn towards the fibula.  Standard 6-hole one-third tubular plate was applied to this.  Again, this was more of a transverse impacted fracture.  Therefore, interfragmentary screw on an angle could not be used.,The posterior cortex was used to assess anatomic reduction.  Screws were placed.  It was used as a spring plate pushing the distal fibular fragment medially.,Screw holes were filled.  They were double-checked.  Screws had excellent purchase and were tightened up.  At this point, lateral views were taken as well as palpation of posterior lateral fragment was performed in the plafond.  This appeared to show anatomic reduction and did not appear to be a step on the articular surface or the posterior cortex of the distal tibia.,The screw was then placed from anterior medial to posterior lateral into this comminuted fragment.,A 2 mm K-wire was used.  Finger was placed on this fragment and the pin was advanced even before the finger.  X-ray views could show the posterior cortex and location of the pin.  This was then exchanged for a 55 mm partially threaded cancellous screw after tapping was performed.  This was double checked to ensure good positioning and this was so.  On the lateral view, we could see this was not in the joint.  AP views and mortise views showed this was not in the joint.  One could palpate this as well.  The screw was placed slightly proximal to distal in the anteroposterior plane.  At the distal tip of it, it was just in the subchondral bone but not in the joint.  There was slight to excellent purchase of this posterior lateral fragment.  Wounds were copiously irrigated followed by closing using 2-0 Vicryl in inverted fashion followed by staples to skin.  Adaptic, 4 x 4s, abdominal pad was placed on wound, held in place with Kerlix followed by an extensor bandage.  Posterior splint was placed on the patient.  The patient's leg was placed in neutral position.  Significant amount of cast padding were used and large bulky trauma ABD type dressings.  The heel was padded and leg was padded with approximately 2 inches of padding.  Tourniquet was deflated.  The patient had good capillary refill, good pulses, and the patient returned to recovery room in stable condition with no complications.  Physician assistant assisted during the case with retracting as well as holding the medial malleolar fragment and fragments in position while placement screws were applied.  Positioning of the leg was accomplished by the physician assistant.

Surgically, the patient has an enlarged fibroid uterus with a large fundal/anterior fibroids, which is approximately 6+ cm and several small submucosal fibroids within the endometrium.  Both ovaries and tubes appeared within normal limits.,PROCEDURE: , The patient was taken to the operating room where she was prepped and draped in the normal sterile fashion in the dorsal supine position.  After the general anesthetic was found to be adequate, a Pfannenstiel skin incision was made with the first knife.  This was carried through the underlying layer of fascia with a second knife.  The fascia was incised in the midline with the second knife and the fascial incision was then extended laterally in both directions with the Mayo scissors.  The superior aspect of the fascial incision was then grasped with Ochsner clamps, tented up, and dissected off the underlying layer of rectus muscle bluntly.  It was then dissected in the middle with the Mayo scissors.  The inferior aspect of this incision was addressed in a similar manner.  The rectus muscles were separated in the midline bluntly.  The peritoneum was identified with hemostat clamps, tented up, and entered sharply with the Metzenbaum scissors.  The peritoneal incision was then extended superiorly and inferiorly with the Metzenbaum scissors and then extended bluntly.  Next, the uterus was grasped bluntly and removed from the abdomen.  The fundal fibroid was identified.  It was then injected with vasopressin, 20 units mixed in 30 cc of normal saline along the serosal surface and careful to aspirate to avoid any blood vessels.  15 cc was injected.  Next, the point tip was used with the cautery _______ cutting to cut the linear incision along the top of the _______ fibroid until fibroid fibers were seen.  The edges of the myometrium was grasped with Allis clamps, tented up, and a hemostat was used to bluntly dissect around the fibroid followed by blunt dissection with a finger.  The fibroid was easily and bluntly dissected out.  It was also grasped with Lahey clamp to prevent traction.  Once the blunt dissection of the large fibroid was complete, it was handed off to the scrub nurse.  The large fibroid traversed the whole myometrium down to the mucosal surface and the endometrial cavity was largely entered when this fibroid was removed.  At this point, several smaller fibroids were noticed along the endometrial surface of the uterus.  Three of these were removed just by bluntly grasping with the Lahey clamp and twisting, all three of these were approximately 1 cm to 2 cm in size.  These were also handed to the scrub tech.  Next, the uterine incision was then closed with first two interrupted layers of #0 chromic in an interrupted figure-of-eight fashion and then with a #0 Vicryl in a running baseball stitch.  The uterus was seen to be completely hemostatic after closure.  Next, a 3 x 4 inch piece of Interceed was placed over the incision and dampened with normal saline.  The uterus was then carefully returned to the abdomen and being careful not to disturb the Interceed.  Next, the greater omentum was replaced over the uterus.,The rectus muscles were then reapproximated with a single interrupted suture of #0 Vicryl in the midline.  Then the fascia was closed with #0 Vicryl in a running fashion.  Next, the Scarpa's fascia was closed with #3-0 plain gut in a running fashion and the skin was closed with #4-0 undyed Vicryl in a running subcuticular fashion.  The incision was then dressed with 0.5-inch Steri-Strips and bandaged appropriately.  After the patient was cleaned, she was taken to Recovery in stable condition and she will be followed for her immediate postoperative period during the hospital.\",\n",

Next, the chest was prepped and draped in a standard surgical fashion.  A #18-gauge spinal needle was used to aspirate blood from the subclavian vein.  After aspiration of venous blood, Seldinger technique was used to thread a J wire.  The distal tip of the J wire was confirmed to be in adequate position with surgeon-interpreted fluoroscopy.  Next a #15-blade scalpel was used to make an incision in the skin.  Dissection was carried down to the level of the pectoralis muscle.  A pocket was created.  A dual-port Port-A-Cath was lowered into the pocket and secured with #2-0 Prolene.  Both ports were flushed.  The distal tip was pulled through to the wire exit site with a Kelly clamp.  It was cut to the appropriate length.  Next a dilator and sheath were threaded over the J wire.  The J wire and dilator were removed, and the distal tip of the dual-port Port-A-Cath was threaded over the sheath, which was simultaneously withdrawn.  Both ports of the dual-port Port-A-Cath were flushed and aspirated without difficulty.  The distal tip was confirmed to be in adequate position with surgeon-interpreted fluoroscopy.  The wire access site was closed with a 4-0 Monocryl.  The port pocket was closed in 2 layers with 2-0 Vicryl followed by 4-0 Monocryl in a running subcuticular fashion.

On reviewing this pathology, it is mostly likely DCIS.  The risks and benefits of the procedure were explained to the patient who appeared to understand and agreed to proceed.  The patient desired MammoSite Radiation Therapy; therefore, the sentinel lymph node biopsy was incorporated into the procedure.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL,The patient was taken to the operating room, placed in supine position, and general LMA anesthesia was administered.  She was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  Prior to the procedure, she underwent nuclear medicine injection with technetium-99 and methylene blue.  Incision was made of the area of great uptake and the axilla and taken through the subcutaneous tissue with electric Bovie cautery.  Two sentinel lymph nodes were identified, one was blue and hot and the other was just hot.  These were sent to Pathology for touch prep.  Adequate hemostasis was obtained.  The wound was packed and attention was turned to the left breast.  Ultrasound was used to identify the marker and the mass within the breast and create an adequate anterior skin flap.  An elliptical incision was made roughly at approximately the 3 o'clock position secondary to subcutaneous tissues with electric Bovie cautery.  The mass was dissected off the surrounding tissue using Bovie cautery down to the level of the pectoralis fascia, which was incorporated within the specimen.
